It	can	be	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	thing	,	the	ocean	.
And	it	can	be	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	thing	,	what	human	health	is	.
And	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	two	together	might	seem	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 daunt 	 ing 	 	task	,	but	what	I	'm	going	to	try	to	say	is	that	even	in	that	 complex 	 ity 	 	,	there	's	some	simple	 theme 	 s 	 	that	I	think	,	if	we	understand	,	we	can	 re 	 ally 	 	move	forward	.
And	 t 	 hose 	 	simple	 theme 	 s 	 	are	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	 theme 	 s 	 	about	the	complex	science	of	what	's	going	on	,	but	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	all	 pre 	 tty 	 	well	know	.
And	I	'm	going	to	start	with	 th 	 is 	 	one	:	If	 mom 	 ma 	 	ai	n't	happy	,	ai	n't	 no 	 body 	 	happy	.
We	know	that	,	right	?	We	've	 experience 	 d 	 	that	.
And	if	we	just	take	that	and	we	build	from	there	,	then	we	can	go	to	the	next	step	,	which	is	that	if	the	ocean	ai	n't	happy	,	ai	n't	 no 	 body 	 	happy	.
That	's	the	theme	of	my	talk	.
And	we	're	making	the	ocean	 pre 	 tty 	 	 un 	 happy 	 	in	a	lot	of	different	ways	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	shot	of	 Can 	 nery 	 	Row	in	1932	.
 Can 	 nery 	 	Row	,	at	the	time	,	had	the	 big 	 gest 	 	industrial	canning	operation	on	the	west	coast	.
We	 pil 	 ed 	 	enormous	 amount 	 s 	 	of	 poll 	 ution 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	air	and	 in 	 to 	 	the	water	.
 Ro 	 lf 	 	 Bo 	 lin 	 	,	who	was	a	professor	at	the	 Hop 	 kin 	 	's	Marine	 St 	 ation 	 	where	I	work	,	wrote	in	the	1940s	that	``	The	 fum 	 es 	 	from	the	 s 	 cum 	 	 float 	 ing 	 	on	the	 in 	 lets 	 	of	the	 ba 	 y 	 	 we 	 re 	 	so	bad	they	 turn 	 ed 	 	 lead 	 - 	 based 	 	 paint 	 s 	 	black	.	''
People	 work 	 ing 	 	in	these	 can 	 n 	 eries 	 	could	 bare 	 ly 	 	stay	there	all	day	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	smell	,	but	you	know	what	they	came	out	 say 	 ing 	 	?
 The 	 y 	 	say	,	``	You	know	what	you	smell	?
You	smell	money	.	''
That	 poll 	 ution 	 	was	money	to	that	community	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	people	 deal 	 t 	 	with	the	 poll 	 ution 	 	and	 absorb 	 ed 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	skin	and	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	bodies	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 need 	 ed 	 	the	money	.
We	made	the	ocean	 un 	 happy 	 	;	we	made	people	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 happy 	 	,	and	we	made	them	 un 	 health 	 y 	 	.
The	 connect 	 ion 	 	between	ocean	health	and	human	health	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	based	 up 	 on 	 	 an 	 other 	 	couple	simple	 ad 	 age 	 s 	 	,	and	I	want	to	call	that	``	pinch	a	 min 	 now 	 	,	hurt	a	whale	.	''
The	pyramid	of	ocean	life	...
 N 	 ow 	 	,	when	an	ecologist	 look 	 s 	 	at	the	ocean	--	I	have	to	tell	you	--	we	look	at	the	ocean	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	different	way	,	and	we	see	different	 thing 	 s 	 	than	when	a	regular	person	 look 	 s 	 	at	the	ocean	 be 	 cause 	 	when	an	ecologist	 look 	 s 	 	at	the	ocean	,	we	see	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 interconnect 	 ions 	 	.
We	see	the	base	of	the	food	chain	,	the	plankton	,	the	small	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	we	see	how	 t 	 hose 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	are	food	to	 animal 	 s 	 	in	the	middle	of	the	pyramid	,	and	on	so	up	 th 	 is 	 	 dia 	 gram 	 	.
And	that	flow	,	that	flow	of	life	,	from	the	 ver 	 y 	 	base	up	to	the	 ver 	 y 	 	top	,	is	the	flow	that	 ecologist 	 s 	 	see	.
And	that	's	what	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	preserve	when	we	say	,	``	 Sav 	 e 	 	the	ocean	.	 He 	 al 	 	the	ocean	.	''
It	's	that	pyramid	.
 N 	 ow 	 	why	 do 	 es 	 	that	matter	for	human	health	?
 Be 	 cause 	 	when	we	jam	 thing 	 s 	 	in	the	bottom	of	that	pyramid	that	should	n't	be	there	,	some	 ver 	 y 	 	 frighten 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	happen	.
 Poll 	 ut 	 ants 	 	,	some	 pollutant 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 create 	 d 	 	by	us	:	 molecule 	 s 	 	like	 PC 	 B 	 s 	 	that	ca	n't	be	broken	down	by	our	bodies	.
And	they	go	in	the	base	of	that	pyramid	,	and	they	drift	up	;	they	're	 pass 	 ed 	 	up	that	way	,	on	to	 predator 	 s 	 	and	on	to	the	top	 predator 	 s 	 	,	and	in	so	 do 	 ing 	 	,	they	 accumul 	 ate 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	to	 br 	 ing 	 	that	home	,	I	thought	I	'd	invent	a	little	game	.
We	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	have	to	play	it	;	we	can	just	think	about	it	here	.
It	's	the	 Styro 	 foam 	 	and	chocolate	game	.
 Imagin 	 e 	 	that	when	we	got	on	 th 	 is 	 	boat	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	all	 give 	 n 	 	two	 Styro 	 foam 	 	 peanut 	 s 	 	.
Ca	n't	do	much	with	them	:	Put	them	in	your	pocket	.
 Sup 	 pose 	 	the	 rule 	 s 	 	are	:	every	time	you	 off 	 er 	 	 some 	 body 	 	a	drink	,	you	give	them	the	drink	,	and	you	give	them	your	 Styro 	 foam 	 	 peanut 	 s 	 	too	.
What	'll	happen	is	that	the	 Styro 	 foam 	 	 peanut 	 s 	 	will	start	moving	through	our	 socie 	 ty 	 	here	,	and	they	will	 accumul 	 ate 	 	in	the	 drunk 	 est 	 	,	 s 	 ting 	 iest 	 	people	.
There	's	no	 mechan 	 ism 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	game	for	them	to	go	 any 	 where 	 	but	 in 	 to 	 	a	 big 	 ger 	 	and	 big 	 ger 	 	pile	of	 in 	 digest 	 ible 	 	 Styro 	 foam 	 	 peanut 	 s 	 	.
And	that	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	 happen 	 s 	 	with	 PD 	 B 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	food	pyramid	:	 The 	 y 	 	 accumul 	 ate 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	top	of	it	.
 N 	 ow 	 	suppose	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 Styro 	 foam 	 	 peanut 	 s 	 	,	we	take	these	 love 	 ly 	 	little	 chocolate 	 s 	 	that	we	get	and	we	had	 t 	 hose 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	.
Well	,	some	of	us	would	be	eating	 t 	 hose 	 	 chocolate 	 s 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 pass 	 ing 	 	them	around	,	and	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 accumul 	 ating 	 	,	they	will	just	pass	 in 	 to 	 	our	group	here	and	not	 accumul 	 ate 	 	in	any	one	group	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	 absorb 	 ed 	 	by	us	.
And	that	's	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	a	 PC 	 B 	 	and	,	say	,	 some 	 thing 	 	natural	like	an	 o 	 mega 	 - 	 3 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	we	want	out	of	the	marine	food	chain	.
 PC 	 B 	 s 	 	 accumul 	 ate 	 	.
We	have	great	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	that	,	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	.
 PC 	 B 	 s 	 	 accumul 	 ate 	 	in	 dolphin 	 s 	 	in	 Sara 	 s 	 ota 	 	Bay	,	in	Texas	,	in	North	 Caro 	 lina 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	get	 in 	 to 	 	the	food	chain	.
The	 dolphin 	 s 	 	eat	the	fish	that	have	 PC 	 B 	 s 	 	from	the	plankton	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	 PC 	 B 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 ing 	 	 fat 	 - 	 soluble 	 	,	 accumul 	 ate 	 	in	these	 dolphin 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	a	dolphin	,	mother	dolphin	,	any	dolphin	--	there	's	 on 	 ly 	 	one	way	that	a	 PC 	 B 	 	can	get	out	of	a	dolphin	.
And	what	's	that	?
In	mother	's	milk	.
 He 	 re 	 	's	a	 dia 	 gram 	 	of	the	 PC 	 B 	 	load	of	 dolphin 	 s 	 	in	 Sara 	 s 	 ota 	 	Bay	.
Adult	 male 	 s 	 	:	a	huge	load	.
 Ju 	 ve 	 ni 	 les 	 	:	a	huge	load	.
 Fe 	 male 	 s 	 	after	 the 	 ir 	 	first	 ca 	 lf 	 	is	 al 	 ready 	 	 wean 	 ed 	 	:	a	lower	load	.
 T 	 hose 	 	 female 	 s 	 	,	they	're	not	 try 	 ing 	 	to	.
 T 	 hose 	 	 female 	 s 	 	are	 pass 	 ing 	 	the	 PC 	 B 	 s 	 	in	the	fat	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	mother	's	milk	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 off 	 spring 	 	,	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 off 	 spring 	 	do	n't	 surviv 	 e 	 	.
The	death	rate	in	these	 dolphin 	 s 	 	,	for	the	first	 ca 	 lf 	 	born	of	every	female	dolphin	,	is	60	to	80	percent	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	 mother 	 s 	 	pump	 the 	 ir 	 	first	 off 	 spring 	 	full	of	 th 	 is 	 	pollutant	,	and	most	of	them	die	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	the	mother	then	can	go	and	 re 	 produce 	 	,	but	what	a	 terr 	 ible 	 	price	to	pay	for	the	 accumul 	 ation 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	pollutant	in	these	 animal 	 s 	 	--	the	death	of	the	 first 	 - 	 born 	 	 ca 	 lf 	 	.
There	's	 an 	 other 	 	top	predator	in	the	ocean	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	.
That	top	predator	,	of	course	,	is	us	.
And	we	 al 	 so 	 	are	eating	meat	that	 come 	 s 	 	from	some	of	these	same	 place 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	whale	meat	that	I	 photograph 	 ed 	 	in	a	 grocer 	 y 	 	store	in	 To 	 kyo 	 	--	or	is	it	?
In	fact	,	what	we	did	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	was	learn	how	to	smuggle	a	 mole 	 cular 	 	biology	lab	 in 	 to 	 	 To 	 kyo 	 	and	use	it	to	 genetic 	 ally 	 	test	the	DNA	out	of	whale	meat	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	and	identify	what	they	 re 	 ally 	 	 we 	 re 	 	.
And	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	whale	meat	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	whale	meat	.
Some	of	them	 we 	 re 	 	 il 	 legal 	 	whale	meat	,	by	the	way	.
That	's	 an 	 other 	 	story	.
But	some	of	them	 we 	 re 	 	not	whale	meat	at	all	.
Even	 th 	 ough 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 label 	 ed 	 	whale	meat	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	dolphin	meat	.
Some	of	them	 we 	 re 	 	dolphin	liver	.	Some	of	them	 we 	 re 	 	dolphin	 blu 	 b 	 ber 	 	.
And	 t 	 hose 	 	dolphin	 part 	 s 	 	had	a	huge	load	of	 PC 	 B 	 s 	 	,	 dioxin 	 s 	 	and	heavy	 metal 	 s 	 	.
And	that	huge	load	was	 pass 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	people	that	ate	 th 	 is 	 	meat	.
It	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	a	lot	of	 dolphin 	 s 	 	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 s 	 old 	 	 a 	 s 	 	meat	in	the	whale	meat	market	around	the	world	.
That	's	a	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	for	 t 	 hose 	 	 population 	 s 	 	,	but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	for	the	people	eating	them	 be 	 cause 	 	they	do	n't	know	that	that	's	toxic	meat	.
We	had	these	data	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
I	remember	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	at	my	desk	 be 	 ing 	 	about	the	 on 	 ly 	 	person	in	the	world	who	 k 	 new 	 	that	whale	meat	 be 	 ing 	 	 s 	 old 	 	in	these	 market 	 s 	 	was	 re 	 ally 	 	dolphin	meat	,	and	it	was	toxic	.
It	had	 two 	 - 	 to 	 - 	 three 	 - 	 to 	 - 	 400 	 	 time 	 s 	 	the	toxic	 load 	 s 	 	ever	 allow 	 ed 	 	by	the	 E 	 PA 	 	.
And	I	remember	there	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	at	my	desk	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	Well	,	I	know	 th 	 is 	 	.	 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	great	scientific	 discover 	 y 	 	,	''	but	it	was	so	awful	.
And	for	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	time	in	my	scientific	 care 	 er 	 	,	I	broke	scientific	 proto 	 col 	 	,	which	is	that	you	take	the	data	and	publish	them	in	scientific	 journal 	 s 	 	and	then	begin	to	talk	about	them	.
We	 s 	 ent 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	polite	letter	to	the	 Mini 	 ster 	 	of	Health	in	Japan	and	 simpl 	 y 	 	 point 	 ed 	 	out	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 in 	 toler 	 able 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	,	not	for	us	,	but	for	the	people	of	Japan	 be 	 cause 	 	 mother 	 s 	 	who	may	be	 breast 	 feed 	 ing 	 	,	who	may	have	young	children	,	would	be	 buy 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	they	thought	was	 health 	 y 	 	,	but	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	toxic	.
That	led	to	a	whole	 s 	 eries 	 	of	other	 campaign 	 s 	 	in	Japan	,	and	I	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	proud	to	say	that	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	to	buy	 any 	 thing 	 	in	Japan	that	's	 label 	 ed 	 	 in 	 correct 	 ly 	 	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	they	're	still	selling	whale	meat	,	which	I	 believ 	 e 	 	they	should	n't	.
But	at	 l 	 east 	 	it	's	 label 	 ed 	 	 correct 	 ly 	 	,	and	you	're	no	 long 	 er 	 	going	to	be	 buy 	 ing 	 	toxic	dolphin	meat	 in 	 stead 	 	.
It	is	n't	just	there	that	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	,	but	in	a	natural	diet	of	some	 commun 	 ities 	 	in	the	Canadian	 arc 	 tic 	 	and	in	the	 Unit 	 ed 	 	 Stat 	 es 	 	and	in	the	European	 arc 	 tic 	 	,	a	natural	diet	of	 seal 	 s 	 	and	 whale 	 s 	 	 lead 	 s 	 	to	an	 accumul 	 ation 	 	of	 PC 	 B 	 s 	 	that	have	 gather 	 ed 	 	up	from	all	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	world	and	 end 	 ed 	 	up	in	these	women	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	women	have	toxic	breast	milk	.
 The 	 y 	 	can	not	feed	 the 	 ir 	 	 off 	 spring 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	children	,	 the 	 ir 	 	breast	milk	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 accumul 	 ation 	 	of	these	 toxin 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	food	chain	,	in	 the 	 ir 	 	part	of	the	world	's	ocean	pyramid	.
That	 mean 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 immun 	 e 	 	 system 	 s 	 	are	 com 	 promise 	 d 	 	.
It	 mean 	 s 	 	that	 the 	 ir 	 	children	's	 develop 	 ment 	 	can	be	 com 	 promise 	 d 	 	.
And	the	world	's	attention	on	 th 	 is 	 	over	the	last	decade	 ha 	 s 	 	 reduc 	 ed 	 	the	problem	for	these	women	,	not	by	changing	the	pyramid	,	but	by	changing	what	they	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	eat	out	of	it	.
We	've	taken	them	out	of	 the 	 ir 	 	natural	pyramid	in	order	to	solve	 th 	 is 	 	problem	.
That	's	a	good	thing	for	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	 a 	 cute 	 	problem	,	but	it	 do 	 es 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	solve	the	pyramid	problem	.
There	's	other	ways	of	 break 	 ing 	 	the	pyramid	.
The	pyramid	,	if	we	jam	 thing 	 s 	 	in	the	bottom	,	can	get	 back 	 ed 	 	up	like	a	 sew 	 er 	 	line	that	's	 clog 	 ged 	 	.
And	if	we	jam	 nutrient 	 s 	 	,	 sew 	 age 	 	,	 fertil 	 izer 	 	in	the	base	of	that	food	pyramid	,	it	can	back	up	all	through	it	.
We	end	up	with	 thing 	 s 	 	we	've	heard	about	before	:	red	 tide 	 s 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	which	are	 bloom 	 s 	 	of	toxic	 al 	 ga 	 e 	 	 float 	 ing 	 	through	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	 caus 	 ing 	 	 neuro 	 logical 	 	damage	.
We	can	 al 	 so 	 	see	 bloom 	 s 	 	of	bacteria	,	 bloom 	 s 	 	of	viruses	in	the	ocean	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	two	 shot 	 s 	 	of	a	red	tide	coming	on	shore	here	and	a	bacteria	in	the	 gen 	 us 	 	vibrio	,	which	 include 	 s 	 	the	 gen 	 us 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	cholera	in	it	.
How	 man 	 y 	 	people	have	 s 	 een 	 	a	``	beach	closed	''	sign	?
Why	 do 	 es 	 	that	happen	?
It	 happen 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	 jamm 	 ed 	 	so	much	 in 	 to 	 	the	base	of	the	natural	ocean	pyramid	that	these	bacteria	clog	it	up	and	 over 	 fill 	 	onto	our	 beach 	 es 	 	.
 Of 	 ten 	 	what	 jam 	 s 	 	us	up	is	 sew 	 age 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	have	ever	gone	to	a	state	park	or	a	national	park	where	you	had	a	big	sign	at	the	front	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	 C 	 lose 	 d 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	human	 sew 	 age 	 	is	so	far	over	 th 	 is 	 	park	that	you	ca	n't	use	it	''	?
Not	 ver 	 y 	 	often	.	We	would	n't	 toler 	 ate 	 	that	.
We	would	n't	 toler 	 ate 	 	our	 park 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 swamp 	 ed 	 	by	human	 sew 	 age 	 	,	but	 beach 	 es 	 	are	closed	a	lot	in	our	country	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	closed	more	and	more	and	more	all	around	the	world	for	the	same	reason	,	and	I	 believ 	 e 	 	we	should	n't	 toler 	 ate 	 	that	either	.
It	's	not	just	a	question	of	 clean 	 lines 	 s 	 	;	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	question	of	how	 t 	 hose 	 	 organism 	 s 	 	then	turn	 in 	 to 	 	human	disease	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	 vibrio 	 s 	 	,	these	bacteria	,	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	infect	people	.
 The 	 y 	 	can	go	 in 	 to 	 	your	skin	and	create	skin	 infect 	 ions 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	graph	from	 NO 	 AA 	 	's	ocean	and	human	health	 initi 	 ative 	 	,	 show 	 ing 	 	the	rise	of	the	 infect 	 ions 	 	by	vibrio	in	people	over	the	last	few	 year 	 s 	 	.
 Sur 	 fer 	 s 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	know	 th 	 is 	 	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	.
And	if	you	can	see	on	some	surfing	 s 	 ites 	 	,	in	fact	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	do	you	see	what	the	 wave 	 s 	 	are	like	or	what	the	weather	's	like	,	but	on	some	surf	rider	 s 	 ites 	 	,	you	see	a	little	 flash 	 ing 	 	poo	alert	.
That	 mean 	 s 	 	that	the	beach	might	have	great	 wave 	 s 	 	,	but	it	's	a	 danger 	 ous 	 	place	for	 surf 	 ers 	 	to	be	 be 	 cause 	 	they	can	carry	with	them	,	even	after	a	great	day	of	surfing	,	 th 	 is 	 	 leg 	 acy 	 	of	an	 infect 	 ion 	 	that	might	take	a	 ver 	 y 	 	long	time	to	solve	.
Some	of	these	 infect 	 ions 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 carry 	 ing 	 	 anti 	 biotic 	 	 resist 	 ance 	 	 gene 	 s 	 	now	,	and	that	 make 	 s 	 	them	even	more	difficult	.

 T 	 hose 	 	 bloom 	 s 	 	are	generating	other	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 chemical 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	just	a	simple	list	of	some	of	the	 type 	 s 	 	of	 poison 	 s 	 	that	come	out	of	these	 harm 	 ful 	 	 al 	 gal 	 	 bloom 	 s 	 	:	 shell 	 fish 	 	 poison 	 ing 	 	,	fish	 ci 	 gua 	 tera 	 	,	diarrheic	 shell 	 fish 	 	 poison 	 ing 	 	--	you	do	n't	want	to	know	about	that	--	 neuro 	 toxic 	 	 shell 	 fish 	 	 poison 	 ing 	 	,	 para 	 ly 	 tic 	 	 shell 	 fish 	 	 poison 	 ing 	 	.

 Cope 	 pods 	 	are	small	 crustacean 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	a	 tin 	 y 	 	fraction	of	an	inch	long	,	and	they	can	carry	on	 the 	 ir 	 	little	 leg 	 s 	 	some	of	the	cholera	bacteria	that	then	 lead 	 s 	 	to	human	disease	.

So	what	do	you	do	?
We	have	major	 problem 	 s 	 	in	 disrupt 	 ed 	 	 eco 	 system 	 	flow	that	the	pyramid	may	not	be	 work 	 ing 	 	so	well	,	that	the	flow	from	the	base	up	 in 	 to 	 	it	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 block 	 ed 	 	and	 clog 	 ged 	 	.
What	do	you	do	when	you	have	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	 disrupt 	 ed 	 	flow	?
Well	,	there	's	a	bunch	of	 thing 	 s 	 	you	could	do	.
You	could	call	 Jo 	 e 	 	the	 P 	 lumber 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
And	he	could	come	in	and	fix	the	flow	.
But	in	fact	,	if	you	look	around	the	world	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	are	there	hope	 spot 	 s 	 	for	where	we	may	be	able	to	fix	 problem 	 s 	 	,	there	have	 be 	 en 	 	 place 	 s 	 	where	 problem 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 fix 	 ed 	 	,	where	people	have	come	to	 grip 	 s 	 	with	these	 issue 	 s 	 	and	 beg 	 un 	 	to	turn	them	around	.
 Monte 	 re 	 y 	 	is	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	.
I	 start 	 ed 	 	out	 show 	 ing 	 	how	much	we	had	 di 	 stress 	 ed 	 	the	 Monte 	 re 	 y 	 	Bay	 eco 	 system 	 	with	 poll 	 ution 	 	and	the	canning	industry	and	all	of	the	 attend 	 ant 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	.
In	1932	,	that	's	the	picture	.
In	2009	,	the	picture	is	 dramat 	 ically 	 	different	.
The	 can 	 n 	 eries 	 	are	gone	.	The	 poll 	 ution 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 ab 	 ated 	 	.
But	there	's	a	 great 	 er 	 	sense	here	that	what	the	individual	 commun 	 ities 	 	need	is	 work 	 ing 	 	 eco 	 system 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	need	a	 function 	 ing 	 	pyramid	from	the	base	all	the	way	to	the	top	.
And	that	pyramid	in	 Monte 	 re 	 y 	 	,	right	now	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 effort 	 s 	 	of	a	lot	of	different	people	,	is	 function 	 ing 	 	better	than	it	's	ever	 function 	 ed 	 	for	the	last	150	 year 	 s 	 	.
It	did	n't	happen	 accident 	 ally 	 	.
It	 happen 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 man 	 y 	 	people	put	 the 	 ir 	 	time	and	effort	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 pioneer 	 ing 	 	spirit	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
On	the	left	there	,	Julia	Platt	,	the	mayor	of	my	little	 home 	 town 	 	in	Pacific	Grove	.
At	74	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	 be 	 came 	 	mayor	 be 	 cause 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	had	to	be	 d 	 one 	 	to	protect	the	ocean	.
In	1931	,	she	 produce 	 d 	 	California	's	first	 community 	 - 	 based 	 	marine	 protect 	 ed 	 	area	,	right	next	to	the	 big 	 gest 	 	polluting	 can 	 nery 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	Julia	 k 	 new 	 	that	when	the	 can 	 n 	 eries 	 	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	 we 	 re 	 	gone	,	the	ocean	 need 	 ed 	 	a	place	to	grow	from	,	that	the	ocean	 need 	 ed 	 	a	place	to	spark	a	seed	,	and	she	 want 	 ed 	 	to	provide	that	seed	.
Other	people	,	like	 D 	 avid 	 	 Pack 	 ard 	 	and	 Ju 	 lie 	 	 Pack 	 ard 	 	,	who	 we 	 re 	 	 instrument 	 al 	 	in	producing	the	 Monte 	 re 	 y 	 	Bay	 aqua 	 rium 	 	to	lock	 in 	 to 	 	people	's	 not 	 ion 	 	that	the	ocean	and	the	health	of	the	ocean	 eco 	 system 	 	 we 	 re 	 	just	 a 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	area	 a 	 s 	 	eating	the	 eco 	 system 	 	would	be	.
That	change	in	 think 	 ing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	led	to	a	 dramat 	 ic 	 	shift	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	in	the	 fortune 	 s 	 	of	 Monte 	 re 	 y 	 	Bay	,	but	other	 place 	 s 	 	around	the	world	.
Well	,	I	want	to	 leav 	 e 	 	you	with	the	thought	that	what	we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	here	is	protect	 th 	 is 	 	ocean	pyramid	,	and	that	ocean	pyramid	 connect 	 s 	 	to	our	own	pyramid	of	life	.
It	's	an	ocean	planet	,	and	we	think	of	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	terrestrial	species	,	but	the	pyramid	of	life	in	the	ocean	and	our	own	 live 	 s 	 	on	land	are	 intric 	 ate 	 ly 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	.
And	it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	through	 hav 	 ing 	 	the	ocean	 be 	 ing 	 	 health 	 y 	 	that	we	can	remain	 health 	 y 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
Thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
Let	's	start	with	day	and	night	.
Life	 evolv 	 ed 	 	under	 condition 	 s 	 	of	light	and	 dark 	 ness 	 	,	light	and	then	 dark 	 ness 	 	.
And	so	 plant 	 s 	 	and	 animal 	 s 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	internal	 clock 	 s 	 	so	that	they	would	be	ready	for	these	 change 	 s 	 	in	light	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	chemical	 clock 	 s 	 	,	and	they	're	found	in	every	known	 be 	 ing 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	two	or	more	 cell 	 s 	 	and	in	some	that	 on 	 ly 	 	have	one	cell	.
I	'll	give	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	--	if	you	take	a	 horse 	 shoe 	 	crab	off	the	beach	,	and	you	fly	it	all	the	way	 a 	 cross 	 	the	continent	,	and	you	drop	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	 slop 	 ed 	 	cage	,	it	will	scramble	up	the	floor	of	the	cage	 a 	 s 	 	the	tide	is	 ris 	 ing 	 	on	 it 	 s 	 	home	 shore 	 s 	 	,	and	it	'll	 s 	 kit 	 ter 	 	down	 aga 	 in 	 	right	 a 	 s 	 	the	water	is	 reced 	 ing 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 mile 	 s 	 	away	.
It	'll	do	 th 	 is 	 	for	 week 	 s 	 	,	 un 	 til 	 	it	kind	of	 gradu 	 ally 	 	 lose 	 s 	 	the	plot	.
And	it	's	 in 	 credible 	 	to	watch	,	but	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	 psych 	 ic 	 	or	 para 	 normal 	 	going	on	;	it	's	 simpl 	 y 	 	that	these	 crab 	 s 	 	have	internal	 cycle 	 s 	 	that	correspond	,	 usual 	 ly 	 	,	with	what	's	going	on	around	it	.
So	,	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	ability	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
And	in	 human 	 s 	 	,	we	call	it	the	``	body	clock	.	''
You	can	see	 th 	 is 	 	most	 clear 	 ly 	 	when	you	take	away	 some 	 one 	 	's	watch	and	you	shut	them	 in 	 to 	 	a	 bunk 	 er 	 	,	deep	 under 	 ground 	 	,	for	a	couple	of	 month 	 s 	 	.
People	 actual 	 ly 	 	volunteer	for	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	they	 usual 	 ly 	 	come	out	kind	of	 r 	 av 	 ing 	 	about	 the 	 ir 	 	productive	time	in	the	hole	.
So	,	no	matter	how	 a 	 typical 	 	these	 subject 	 s 	 	would	have	to	be	,	they	all	show	the	same	thing	.
 The 	 y 	 	get	up	just	a	little	bit	 lat 	 er 	 	every	day	--	say	15	 minute 	 s 	 	or	so	--	and	they	kind	of	drift	all	the	way	around	the	clock	like	 th 	 is 	 	over	the	course	of	the	 week 	 s 	 	.
And	so	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	we	know	that	they	are	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	internal	 clock 	 s 	 	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 some 	 how 	 	 sens 	 ing 	 	the	day	 out 	 side 	 	.
So	fine	,	we	have	a	body	clock	,	and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	it	's	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	in	our	 live 	 s 	 	.
It	's	a	huge	driver	for	culture	and	I	think	that	it	's	the	most	 under 	 rated 	 	force	on	our	behavior	.
We	 evolv 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	species	near	the	 equ 	 ator 	 	,	and	so	we	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 well 	 - 	 equi 	 pped 	 	to	deal	with	12	 hour 	 s 	 	of	 day 	 light 	 	and	12	 hour 	 s 	 	of	 dark 	 ness 	 	.
But	of	course	,	we	've	spread	to	every	corner	of	the	 glob 	 e 	 	and	in	 Arc 	 tic 	 	Canada	,	where	I	live	,	we	have	 perpetu 	 al 	 	 day 	 light 	 	in	summer	and	24	 hour 	 s 	 	of	 dark 	 ness 	 	in	winter	.
So	the	culture	,	the	 north 	 ern 	 	 ab 	 original 	 	culture	,	 tradition 	 ally 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 high 	 ly 	 	 season 	 al 	 	.
In	winter	,	there	's	a	lot	of	 sleep 	 ing 	 	going	on	;	you	enjoy	your	family	life	 in 	 side 	 	.
And	in	summer	,	it	's	 al 	 most 	 	 man 	 ic 	 	 hunt 	 ing 	 	and	 work 	 ing 	 	activity	 ver 	 y 	 	long	 hour 	 s 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	active	.
So	,	what	would	our	natural	rhythm	look	like	?
What	would	our	 sleep 	 ing 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	be	in	the	sort	of	ideal	sense	?
Well	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	when	people	are	living	 with 	 out 	 	any	sort	of	artificial	light	at	all	,	they	sleep	twice	every	night	.
 The 	 y 	 	go	to	bed	around	8:00	p.m	.
 un 	 til 	 	 mid 	 night 	 	and	then	 aga 	 in 	 	,	they	sleep	from	about	2:00	 a.m 	 . 	 	 un 	 til 	 	 s 	 un 	 rise 	 	.
And	 in 	 - 	 between 	 	,	they	have	a	couple	of	 hour 	 s 	 	of	sort	of	 medit 	 ative 	 	quiet	in	bed	.
And	 dur 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	time	,	there	's	a	 s 	 urge 	 	of	 pro 	 lac 	 tin 	 	,	the	 like 	 s 	 	of	which	a	modern	day	never	 s 	 ees 	 	.
The	people	in	these	 stud 	 ies 	 	report	 feel 	 ing 	 	so	awake	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	 day 	 time 	 	,	that	they	 real 	 ize 	 	they	're	 ex 	 peri 	 encing 	 	true	 wake 	 fulness 	 	for	the	first	time	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
So	,	cut	to	the	modern	day	.
We	're	living	in	a	culture	of	jet	lag	,	global	travel	,	24-hour	business	,	shift	work	.
And	you	know	,	our	modern	ways	of	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	have	 the 	 ir 	 	 advantage 	 s 	 	,	but	I	 believ 	 e 	 	we	should	understand	the	 cost 	 s 	 	.
Thank	you	.
 Adria 	 n 	 	 Kohl 	 er 	 	:	Well	,	we	're	here	 to 	 day 	 	to	talk	about	the	evolution	of	a	puppet	horse	.
 Bas 	 il 	 	 Jon 	 es 	 	:	But	 actual 	 ly 	 	we	're	going	to	start	 th 	 is 	 	evolution	with	a	hyena	.
AK	:	The	 ance 	 s 	 tor 	 	of	the	horse	.
 Oka 	 y 	 	,	we	'll	do	 some 	 thing 	 	with	it	.
The	hyena	is	the	 ance 	 s 	 tor 	 	of	the	horse	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	part	of	a	production	 call 	 ed 	 	``	Faustus	in	 Afri 	 ca 	 	,	''	a	 Hand 	 spring 	 	 Product 	 ion 	 	from	1995	,	where	it	had	to	play	draughts	with	Helen	of	 T 	 roy 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	production	was	 direct 	 ed 	 	by	South	African	artist	and	theater	director	,	William	Kentridge	.
So	it	 need 	 ed 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	articulate	front	paw	.
But	,	like	all	 puppet 	 s 	 	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	other	 attribut 	 es 	 	.
 B 	 J 	 	:	One	of	them	is	breath	,	and	it	kind	of	 breathe 	 s 	 	.
AK	:	Haa	haa	haaa	.
 B 	 J 	 	:	 Brea 	 th 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	for	us	.
It	's	the	kind	of	original	 move 	 ment 	 	for	any	puppet	for	us	 on 	 stage 	 	.
It	's	the	thing	that	 distinguish 	 es 	 	the	puppet	--	AK	:	Oops	.
 B 	 J 	 	:	From	an	 a 	 ctor 	 	.
 Pup 	 pet 	 s 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	have	to	try	to	be	 al 	 ive 	 	.
It	's	 the 	 ir 	 	kind	of	ur-story	 on 	 stage 	 	,	that	 de 	 s 	 per 	 ation 	 	to	live	.
AK	:	Yeah	,	it	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	a	dead	object	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	and	it	 on 	 ly 	 	 live 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	you	make	it	.
An	 a 	 ctor 	 	 struggle 	 s 	 	to	die	 on 	 stage 	 	,	but	a	puppet	 ha 	 s 	 	to	struggle	to	live	.
And	in	a	way	that	's	a	metaphor	for	life	.
 B 	 J 	 	:	So	every	moment	it	's	on	the	stage	,	it	's	making	the	struggle	.
So	we	call	 th 	 is 	 	a	piece	of	 emotion 	 al 	 	 engineer 	 ing 	 	that	uses	up-to-the-minute	17th	century	technology	--	to	turn	 no 	 un 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 verb 	 s 	 	.
AK	:	Well	 actual 	 ly 	 	I	prefer	to	say	that	it	's	an	object	 construct 	 ed 	 	out	of	wood	and	cloth	with	 move 	 ment 	 	built	 in 	 to 	 	it	to	 persuad 	 e 	 	you	to	 believ 	 e 	 	that	it	 ha 	 s 	 	life	.
 B 	 J 	 	:	 Oka 	 y 	 	so	.
AK	:	It	 ha 	 s 	 	 ear 	 s 	 	that	move	 pass 	 ively 	 	when	the	head	 go 	 es 	 	.
 B 	 J 	 	:	And	it	 ha 	 s 	 	these	bulkheads	made	out	of	 ply 	 wood 	 	,	 cover 	 ed 	 	with	fabric	--	 cur 	 iously 	 	similar	,	in	fact	,	to	the	 ply 	 wood 	 	 canoe 	 s 	 	that	 Adria 	 n 	 	's	father	used	to	make	when	he	was	a	boy	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 work 	 shop 	 	.
AK	:	In	Port	Elizabeth	,	the	village	 out 	 side 	 	Port	Elizabeth	in	South	 Afri 	 ca 	 	.
 B 	 J 	 	:	 Hi 	 s 	 	mother	was	a	 puppet 	 eer 	 	.
And	when	we	met	at	art	school	and	fell	in	love	in	1971	,	I	 hat 	 ed 	 	 puppet 	 s 	 	.
I	 re 	 ally 	 	thought	they	 we 	 re 	 	so	 be 	 neath 	 	me	.
I	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	an	 av 	 ant 	 - 	 gar 	 de 	 	artist	--	and	Punch	and	 Ju 	 dy 	 	was	 certain 	 ly 	 	not	where	I	 want 	 ed 	 	to	go	.
And	,	in	fact	,	it	took	about	10	 year 	 s 	 	to	discover	the	Bambara	Bamana	 puppet 	 s 	 	of	Mali	in	West	 Afri 	 ca 	 	,	where	there	's	a	fabulous	tradition	of	 puppet 	 ry 	 	,	to	learn	a	 renew 	 ed 	 	,	or	a	new	,	respect	for	 th 	 is 	 	art	form	.
AK	:	So	in	1981	,	I	 persuad 	 ed 	 	 Bas 	 il 	 	and	some	 friend 	 s 	 	of	mine	to	form	a	puppet	company	.
And	20	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	 miracul 	 ously 	 	,	we	 collabor 	 ated 	 	with	a	company	from	Mali	,	the	Sogolon	Marionette	Troupe	of	Bamako	,	where	we	made	a	piece	about	a	tall	giraffe	.
It	was	just	 call 	 ed 	 	``	Tall	 Hor 	 s 	 e 	 	,	''	which	was	a	 life 	 - 	 sized 	 	giraffe	.
 B 	 J 	 	:	And	here	 aga 	 in 	 	,	you	see	the	same	structure	.
The	bulkheads	have	now	 turn 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 hoop 	 s 	 	of	 can 	 e 	 	,	but	it	's	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	the	same	structure	.
It	's	got	two	people	 in 	 side 	 	it	on	 s 	 tilt 	 s 	 	,	which	give	them	the	height	,	and	 some 	 body 	 	in	the	front	who	's	using	a	kind	of	 steer 	 ing 	 	wheel	to	move	that	head	.
AK	:	The	person	in	the	hind	 leg 	 s 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	 controll 	 ing 	 	the	tail	,	a	bit	like	the	hyena	--	same	 mechan 	 ism 	 	,	just	a	bit	 big 	 ger 	 	.
And	he	's	 controll 	 ing 	 	the	ear	 move 	 ment 	 	.
 B 	 J 	 	:	So	 th 	 is 	 	production	was	 s 	 een 	 	by	Tom	Morris	of	the	National	 T 	 heat 	 re 	 	in	London	.
And	just	around	that	time	,	his	mother	had	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 Hav 	 e 	 	you	 s 	 een 	 	 th 	 is 	 	book	by	Michael	 Mor 	 pur 	 go 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	'War	 Hor 	 s 	 e 	 	'	?	''
AK	:	It	's	about	a	boy	who	 fall 	 s 	 	in	love	with	a	horse	.
The	horse	is	 s 	 old 	 	to	the	First	World	War	,	and	he	 join 	 s 	 	up	to	find	his	horse	.
 B 	 J 	 	:	So	Tom	 g 	 ave 	 	us	a	call	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Do	you	think	you	could	make	us	a	horse	for	a	show	to	happen	at	the	National	 T 	 heat 	 re 	 	?	''
AK	:	It	 seem 	 ed 	 	a	 love 	 ly 	 	idea	.
 B 	 J 	 	:	But	it	had	to	ride	.	It	had	to	have	a	rider	.
AK	:	It	had	to	have	a	rider	,	and	it	had	to	 particip 	 ate 	 	in	cavalry	 charge 	 s 	 	.
A	play	about	early	20th	century	 plow 	 ing 	 	technology	and	cavalry	 charge 	 s 	 	was	a	little	bit	of	a	 challeng 	 e 	 	for	the	 account 	 ing 	 	 depart 	 ment 	 	at	the	National	 T 	 heat 	 re 	 	in	London	.
But	they	 agree 	 d 	 	to	go	 a 	 long 	 	with	it	for	a	while	.
So	we	 beg 	 an 	 	with	a	test	.
 B 	 J 	 	:	 Th 	 is 	 	is	 Adria 	 n 	 	and	 Th 	 y 	 s 	 	Stander	,	who	went	on	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	design	the	 can 	 e 	 	system	for	the	horse	,	and	our	 next 	 - 	 door 	 	neighbor	 Ka 	 ther 	 ine 	 	,	 rid 	 ing 	 	on	a	 lad 	 der 	 	.
The	weight	is	 re 	 ally 	 	difficult	when	it	's	up	above	your	head	.
AK	:	And	once	we	put	 Ka 	 ther 	 ine 	 	through	that	 part 	 icular 	 	brand	of	hell	,	we	 k 	 new 	 	that	we	might	be	able	to	make	a	horse	,	which	could	be	ridden	.
So	we	made	a	model	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	 card 	 board 	 	model	,	a	little	bit	 small 	 er 	 	than	the	hyena	.
You	'll	notice	that	the	 leg 	 s 	 	are	 ply 	 wood 	 	 leg 	 s 	 	and	the	canoe	structure	is	still	there	.
 B 	 J 	 	:	And	the	two	 manipul 	 ators 	 	are	 in 	 side 	 	.
But	we	did	n't	 real 	 ize 	 	at	the	time	that	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	 need 	 ed 	 	a	third	manipulator	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	could	n't	 manipul 	 ate 	 	the	neck	from	 in 	 side 	 	and	walk	the	horse	at	the	same	time	.
AK	:	We	 start 	 ed 	 	work	on	the	prototype	after	the	model	was	approved	,	and	the	prototype	took	a	bit	 long 	 er 	 	than	we	 anticip 	 ated 	 	.
We	had	to	throw	out	the	 ply 	 wood 	 	 leg 	 s 	 	and	make	new	 can 	 e 	 	 one 	 s 	 	.
And	we	had	a	 crat 	 e 	 	built	for	it	.
It	had	to	be	 ship 	 ped 	 	to	London	.
We	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	test-drive	it	on	the	street	 out 	 side 	 	of	our	house	in	 Cap 	 e 	 	 T 	 own 	 	,	and	it	got	to	 mid 	 night 	 	and	we	had	n't	 d 	 one 	 	that	yet	.
 B 	 J 	 	:	So	we	got	a	camera	,	and	we	posed	the	puppet	in	 vari 	 ous 	 	 gall 	 op 	 ing 	 	stances	.
And	we	 s 	 ent 	 	it	off	to	the	National	 T 	 heat 	 re 	 	,	 hop 	 ing 	 	that	they	 believ 	 ed 	 	that	we	 create 	 d 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 work 	 ed 	 	.
AK	:	A	month	 lat 	 er 	 	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	there	in	London	with	 th 	 is 	 	big	box	and	a	studio	full	of	people	about	to	work	with	us	.
 B 	 J 	 	:	 Ab 	 out 	 	40	people	.
AK	:	We	 we 	 re 	 	 terr 	 ified 	 	.
We	 open 	 ed 	 	the	 li 	 d 	 	,	we	took	the	horse	out	,	and	it	did	work	;	it	 walk 	 ed 	 	and	it	was	able	to	be	ridden	.
 He 	 re 	 	I	have	an	18-second	clip	of	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	walk	of	the	prototype	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	in	the	National	 T 	 heat 	 re 	 	studio	,	the	place	where	they	cook	new	 idea 	 s 	 	.
It	had	by	no	 mean 	 s 	 	got	the	green	light	yet	.
The	 choreograph 	 er 	 	,	Toby	Sedgwick	,	 invent 	 ed 	 	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	sequence	where	the	baby	horse	,	which	was	made	out	of	 stick 	 s 	 	and	bits	of	 t 	 wig 	 s 	 	,	grew	up	 in 	 to 	 	the	big	horse	.
And	Nick	Starr	,	the	director	of	the	National	 T 	 heat 	 re 	 	,	saw	that	 part 	 icular 	 	moment	,	he	was	 stand 	 ing 	 	next	to	me	--	he	 near 	 ly 	 	wet	 him 	 self 	 	.
And	so	the	show	was	 give 	 n 	 	the	green	light	.
And	we	went	back	to	 Cap 	 e 	 	 T 	 own 	 	and	 re 	 designed 	 	the	horse	 complete 	 ly 	 	.
 He 	 re 	 	is	the	plan	.
And	here	is	our	 factor 	 y 	 	in	 Cap 	 e 	 	 T 	 own 	 	where	we	make	 horse 	 s 	 	.
You	can	see	 quit 	 e 	 	a	lot	of	 skeleton 	 s 	 	in	the	 back 	 ground 	 	there	.
The	 horse 	 s 	 	are	 complete 	 ly 	 	 hand 	 made 	 	.
There	is	 ver 	 y 	 	little	20th	century	technology	in	them	.
We	used	a	bit	of	laser	cutting	on	the	 ply 	 wood 	 	and	some	of	the	 a 	 lumin 	 um 	 	 piece 	 s 	 	.
But	 be 	 cause 	 	they	have	to	be	light	and	 flex 	 ible 	 	,	and	each	one	of	them	is	different	,	they	ca	n't	be	 mass 	 - 	 produce 	 d 	 	,	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	.
So	here	are	some	 half 	 - 	 finish 	 ed 	 	 horse 	 s 	 	ready	to	be	 work 	 ed 	 	in	London	.
And	now	we	would	like	to	 introduc 	 e 	 	you	to	 Jo 	 ey 	 	.
 Jo 	 ey 	 	boy	,	you	there	?
 Jo 	 ey 	 	.
 Jo 	 ey 	 	.
 Jo 	 ey 	 	,	come	here	.
No	,	no	,	I	have	n't	got	it	.
He	's	got	it	;	it	's	in	his	pocket	.
 B 	 J 	 	:	 Jo 	 ey 	 	.
AK	:	 Jo 	 ey 	 	,	 Jo 	 ey 	 	,	 Jo 	 ey 	 	,	 Jo 	 ey 	 	.
Come	here	.	 Stan 	 d 	 	here	where	people	can	see	you	.
Move	around	.	Come	on	.
I	'd	just	like	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	--	I	wo	n't	talk	too	loud	.	He	might	get	 irrit 	 ated 	 	.
 He 	 re 	 	,	Craig	is	 work 	 ing 	 	the	head	.
He	 ha 	 s 	 	 bi 	 cycle 	 	brake	 cable 	 s 	 	going	down	to	the	head	control	in	his	hand	.
 E 	 ach 	 	one	of	them	 oper 	 ates 	 	either	an	ear	,	 separat 	 e 	 ly 	 	,	or	the	head	,	up	and	down	.
But	he	 al 	 so 	 	 control 	 s 	 	the	head	 direct 	 ly 	 	by	using	his	hand	.
The	 ear 	 s 	 	are	 obvious 	 ly 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 emotion 	 al 	 	 indic 	 ator 	 	of	the	horse	.
When	they	point	right	back	,	the	horse	is	 fear 	 ful 	 	or	 ang 	 ry 	 	,	 depend 	 ing 	 	 up 	 on 	 	what	's	going	on	in	front	of	him	,	around	him	.
Or	,	when	he	's	more	 relax 	 ed 	 	,	the	head	 come 	 s 	 	down	and	the	 ear 	 s 	 	listen	,	either	side	.
Horses	'	 hear 	 ing 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
It	's	 al 	 most 	 	more	 import 	 ant 	 	than	 the 	 ir 	 	 eye 	 sight 	 	.
Over	here	,	 Tom 	 my 	 	's	got	what	you	call	the	heart	position	.
He	's	 work 	 ing 	 	the	leg	.
You	see	the	string	 tend 	 on 	 	from	the	hyena	,	the	hyena	's	front	leg	,	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	 pull 	 s 	 	the	hoop	up	.
Horses	are	so	 un 	 predict 	 able 	 	.
The	way	a	hoof	 come 	 s 	 	up	with	a	horse	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	 give 	 s 	 	you	the	 feel 	 ing 	 	that	it	's	a	convincing	horse	action	.
The	hind	 leg 	 s 	 	have	got	the	same	action	.
 B 	 J 	 	:	And	Mikey	 al 	 so 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	,	in	his	 finger 	 s 	 	,	the	ability	to	move	the	tail	from	left	to	right	,	and	up	and	down	with	the	other	hand	.
And	together	,	there	's	 quit 	 e 	 	a	complex	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	tail	 express 	 ion 	 	.
AK	:	You	want	to	say	 some 	 thing 	 	about	the	 breath 	 ing 	 	?
 B 	 J 	 	:	We	had	a	big	 challeng 	 e 	 	with	 breath 	 ing 	 	.
that	he	was	going	to	have	to	split	the	chest	of	the	puppet	in	two	and	make	it	breathe	like	that	--	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	how	a	horse	would	breathe	,	with	an	 expand 	 ed 	 	chest	.
But	we	 real 	 ized 	 	that	,	if	that	 we 	 re 	 	to	be	 happen 	 ing 	 	,	you	would	n't	,	 a 	 s 	 	an	audience	,	see	the	breath	.
So	he	made	a	channel	in	here	,	and	the	chest	 move 	 s 	 	up	and	down	in	that	channel	.
So	it	's	anti-naturalistic	 re 	 ally 	 	,	the	up	and	down	 move 	 ment 	 	,	but	it	 feel 	 s 	 	like	breath	.
And	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 be 	 cause 	 	all	that	 happen 	 s 	 	is	that	the	 puppet 	 eer 	 	 breathe 	 s 	 	with	his	 knee 	 s 	 	.
AK	:	Other	 emotion 	 al 	 	stuff	.
If	I	 we 	 re 	 	to	touch	the	horse	here	on	his	skin	,	the	heart	 puppet 	 eer 	 	can	shake	the	body	from	 in 	 side 	 	and	get	the	skin	to	quiver	.
You	'll	notice	,	of	course	,	that	the	puppet	is	made	out	of	 can 	 e 	 	lines	.
And	I	would	like	you	to	 believ 	 e 	 	that	it	was	an	aesthetic	choice	,	that	I	was	making	a	 three 	 - 	 dimensional 	 	 draw 	 ing 	 	of	a	horse	that	 some 	 how 	 	 move 	 s 	 	in	space	.
But	of	course	,	it	was	the	 can 	 e 	 	is	light	,	the	 can 	 e 	 	is	 flex 	 ible 	 	,	the	 can 	 e 	 	is	 dur 	 able 	 	and	the	 can 	 e 	 	is	moldable	.
And	so	it	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	practical	reason	why	it	was	made	of	 can 	 e 	 	.
The	skin	 it 	 self 	 	is	made	out	of	a	 see 	 - 	 through 	 	nylon	mesh	,	which	,	if	the	 light 	 ing 	 	 design 	 er 	 	 want 	 s 	 	the	horse	to	 al 	 most 	 	disappear	,	she	can	light	the	 back 	 ground 	 	and	the	horse	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	ghostlike	.
You	see	the	skeletal	structure	of	it	.
Or	if	you	light	it	from	above	,	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	more	solid	.
 Aga 	 in 	 	,	that	was	a	practical	 consider 	 ation 	 	.
The	 guy 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	the	horse	have	to	be	able	to	see	out	.
 The 	 y 	 	have	to	be	able	to	act	 a 	 long 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	fellow	 act 	 ors 	 	in	the	production	.
And	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	much	an	in-the-moment	activity	that	they	're	 engag 	 ed 	 	in	.
It	's	three	 head 	 s 	 	making	one	character	.
But	now	we	would	like	you	to	put	 Jo 	 ey 	 	through	some	 pace 	 s 	 	.
And	plant	.
Thank	you	.
And	now	just	--	All	the	way	from	 s 	 un 	 ny 	 	California	we	have	Zem	Joaquin	who	's	going	to	ride	the	horse	for	us	.
So	we	would	like	to	stress	that	the	performance	you	see	in	the	horse	is	three	 guy 	 s 	 	who	have	 stud 	 ied 	 	horse	behavior	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 thorough 	 ly 	 	.
 B 	 J 	 	:	Not	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	talk	to	one	 an 	 other 	 	while	they	're	 on 	 stage 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	mic	'd	.
The	sound	that	that	 ver 	 y 	 	large	chest	 make 	 s 	 	,	of	the	horse	--	the	whinnying	and	the	nickering	and	 every 	 thing 	 	--	that	 start 	 s 	 	 usual 	 ly 	 	with	one	 perform 	 er 	 	,	 car 	 ries 	 	on	with	a	second	person	and	 end 	 s 	 	with	a	third	.
AK	:	Mikey	Brett	from	 Leicester 	 s 	 hire 	 	.
Mikey	Brett	,	Craig	,	 Le 	 o 	 	,	Zem	Joaquin	and	 Bas 	 il 	 	and	me	.
Thank	you	.	Thank	you	.
I	want	to	help	you	 re 	 - 	 perceive 	 	what	 philanthro 	 py 	 	is	,	what	it	could	be	,	and	what	your	relationship	to	it	is	.
And	in	 do 	 ing 	 	that	,	I	want	to	 off 	 er 	 	you	a	vision	,	an	 imagin 	 ed 	 	future	,	if	you	will	,	of	how	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	poet	 Sea 	 mus 	 	 Hea 	 ney 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	put	it	,	``	 O 	 nce 	 	in	a	 life 	 time 	 	the	 long 	 ed 	 - 	 for 	 	 tid 	 al 	 	wave	of	justice	can	rise	up	,	and	hope	and	 histo 	 ry 	 	 rhym 	 e 	 	.	''
I	want	to	start	with	these	word	 pair 	 s 	 	here	.
We	all	know	which	side	of	these	we	'd	like	to	be	on	.
When	 philanthro 	 py 	 	was	 re 	 invent 	 ed 	 	a	century	ago	,	when	the	 found 	 ation 	 	form	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 invent 	 ed 	 	,	they	did	n't	think	of	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	on	the	wrong	side	of	these	either	.
In	fact	they	would	never	have	thought	of	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 a 	 s 	 	closed	and	set	in	 the 	 ir 	 	ways	,	 a 	 s 	 	 s 	 low 	 	to	respond	to	new	 challeng 	 es 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	small	and	 risk 	 - 	 a 	 verse 	 	.
And	in	fact	they	 we 	 re 	 	n't	.	 The 	 y 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 invent 	 ing 	 	 char 	 ity 	 	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 time 	 s 	 	,	what	 Rock 	 efeller 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	``	the	business	of	 benevol 	 ence 	 	.	''
But	by	the	end	of	the	20th	century	,	a	new	generation	of	 critic 	 s 	 	and	 reform 	 ers 	 	had	come	to	see	 philanthro 	 py 	 	just	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
The	thing	to	watch	for	 a 	 s 	 	a	global	 philanthro 	 py 	 	industry	 come 	 s 	 	about	--	and	that	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	--	is	how	the	 aspir 	 ation 	 	is	to	flip	these	old	 assumption 	 s 	 	,	for	 philanthro 	 py 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	open	and	big	and	fast	and	 connect 	 ed 	 	,	in	service	of	the	long	term	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 entrepreneur 	 ial 	 	energy	is	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	from	 man 	 y 	 	 quarter 	 s 	 	.
And	it	's	driven	and	 propel 	 led 	 	forward	by	new	 lead 	 ers 	 	,	like	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	people	here	,	by	new	 tool 	 s 	 	,	like	the	 one 	 s 	 	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	here	,	and	by	new	 pressure 	 s 	 	.
I	've	 be 	 en 	 	 follow 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	change	for	 quit 	 e 	 	a	while	now	,	and	 particip 	 ating 	 	in	it	.
 Th 	 is 	 	report	is	our	main	public	report	.
What	it	 tell 	 s 	 	is	the	story	of	how	 to 	 day 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	could	be	 a 	 s 	 	historic	 a 	 s 	 	100	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
What	I	want	to	do	is	share	some	of	the	 cool 	 est 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	going	on	with	you	.
And	 a 	 s 	 	I	do	that	,	I	'm	not	going	to	 d 	 well 	 	much	on	the	 ver 	 y 	 	large	 philanthro 	 py 	 	that	 every 	 body 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	 know 	 s 	 	about	--	the	 Gate 	 s 	 	or	the	 So 	 ros 	 	or	the	Google	.
 In 	 stead 	 	,	what	I	want	to	do	is	talk	about	the	 philanthro 	 py 	 	of	all	of	us	:	the	 democrat 	 ization 	 	of	 philanthro 	 py 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	moment	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	when	the	average	person	 ha 	 s 	 	more	power	than	at	any	time	.
What	I	'm	going	to	do	is	look	at	five	 categor 	 ies 	 	of	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	each	of	which	 challeng 	 es 	 	an	old	assumption	of	 philanthro 	 py 	 	.
The	first	is	mass	 collabor 	 ation 	 	,	 represent 	 ed 	 	here	by	Wikipedia	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	may	surprise	you	.
But	remember	,	 philanthro 	 py 	 	is	about	giving	of	time	and	talent	,	not	just	money	.

 N 	 ow 	 	,	all	of	these	big	 thing 	 s 	 	for	love	--	 experiment 	 s 	 	--	are	n't	going	to	take	off	.
But	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	do	are	going	to	be	the	 big 	 gest 	 	,	the	most	open	,	the	 fast 	 est 	 	,	the	most	 connect 	 ed 	 	form	of	 philanthro 	 py 	 	in	human	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
Second	 categor 	 y 	 	is	 on 	 line 	 	 philanthro 	 py 	 	 market 	 place 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	,	of	course	,	to	 philanthro 	 py 	 	what	 e 	 Bay 	 	and	Amazon	are	to	commerce	.
Think	of	it	 a 	 s 	 	 peer 	 - 	 to 	 - 	 peer 	 	 philanthro 	 py 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	 challeng 	 es 	 	yet	 an 	 other 	 	assumption	,	which	is	that	 organize 	 d 	 	 philanthro 	 py 	 	is	 on 	 ly 	 	for	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 wealth 	 y 	 	.
Take	a	look	,	if	you	have	n't	,	at	 Don 	 ors 	 Choos 	 e 	 	.
Omidyar	 Net 	 work 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	made	a	big	 invest 	 ment 	 	in	 Don 	 ors 	 Choos 	 e 	 	.

And	it	 go 	 es 	 	on	and	on	.
The	third	 categor 	 y 	 	is	 represent 	 ed 	 	by	 War 	 ren 	 	Buffet	,	which	I	call	 aggreg 	 ated 	 	giving	.
It	's	not	just	that	 War 	 ren 	 	Buffet	was	so	 amaz 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 gen 	 er 	 ous 	 	in	that	historic	act	last	summer	.
It	's	that	he	 challeng 	 ed 	 	 an 	 other 	 	assumption	,	that	every	giver	should	have	his	or	her	own	fund	or	 found 	 ation 	 	.
There	are	now	,	 to 	 day 	 	,	so	 man 	 y 	 	new	 fund 	 s 	 	that	are	 aggreg 	 ating 	 	giving	and	 invest 	 ing 	 	,	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	together	people	around	a	common	goal	,	to	think	 big 	 ger 	 	.

But	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 other 	 s 	 	:	New	 Pro 	 fit 	 	in	 Cam 	 bridge 	 	,	New	School	's	 Ven 	 ture 	 	Fund	in	Silicon	 Valle 	 y 	 	,	 Ven 	 ture 	 	 Phil 	 anthro 	 py 	 	Partners	in	 Wash 	 ington 	 	,	Global	Fund	for	Women	in	San	 Francis 	 co 	 	.
Take	a	look	at	these	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	 fund 	 s 	 	are	to	 philanthro 	 py 	 	what	venture	capital	,	private	 equ 	 ity 	 	,	and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	mutual	 fund 	 s 	 	are	to	 invest 	 ing 	 	,	but	with	a	twist	--	 be 	 cause 	 	often	a	community	 form 	 s 	 	around	these	 fund 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 ha 	 s 	 	at	 A 	 cum 	 en 	 	and	other	 place 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	imagine	for	a	second	these	first	three	 type 	 s 	 	of	 experiment 	 s 	 	:	mass	 collabor 	 ation 	 	,	 on 	 line 	 	 market 	 place 	 s 	 	,	 aggreg 	 ated 	 	giving	.
And	understand	how	they	help	us	 re 	 - 	 perceive 	 	what	 organize 	 d 	 	 philanthro 	 py 	 	is	.
It	's	not	about	 found 	 ations 	 	 necess 	 arily 	 	;	it	's	about	the	rest	of	us	.
And	imagine	the	 mash 	 - 	 up 	 	,	if	you	will	,	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	in	the	future	,	when	these	 thing 	 s 	 	come	together	in	the	 experiment 	 s 	 	of	the	future	--	imagine	that	 some 	 body 	 	 put 	 s 	 	up	,	say	,	100	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	for	an	inspiring	goal	--	there	 we 	 re 	 	21	 gift 	 s 	 	of	100	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	or	more	in	the	US	last	year	,	not	out	of	the	question	--	but	 on 	 ly 	 	 put 	 s 	 	it	up	if	it	's	 match 	 ed 	 	by	 million 	 s 	 	of	small	 gift 	 s 	 	from	around	the	 glob 	 e 	 	,	 there 	 by 	 	 engag 	 ing 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	people	,	and	building	 vis 	 ibility 	 	and	 engag 	 ing 	 	people	in	the	goal	that	's	 state 	 d 	 	.
I	'm	going	to	look	 quick 	 ly 	 	at	the	fourth	and	fifth	 categor 	 ies 	 	,	which	are	 innov 	 ation 	 	,	 com 	 petition 	 s 	 	and	social	 invest 	 ing 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	 bet 	 ting 	 	a	visible	 com 	 petition 	 	,	a	prize	,	can	attract	talent	and	money	to	some	of	the	most	difficult	 issue 	 s 	 	,	and	 there 	 by 	 	speed	the	solution	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 tackle 	 s 	 	yet	 an 	 other 	 	assumption	,	that	the	giver	and	the	 organ 	 ization 	 	is	at	the	center	,	 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	 put 	 ting 	 	the	problem	at	the	center	.
You	can	look	to	these	 innov 	 ators 	 	to	help	us	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	with	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 requir 	 e 	 	 techno 	 logical 	 	or	scientific	solution	.
That	 leav 	 es 	 	the	final	 categor 	 y 	 	,	social	 invest 	 ing 	 	,	which	is	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 any 	 way 	 	,	the	 big 	 gest 	 	of	them	all	,	 represent 	 ed 	 	here	by	 Xigi 	 .net 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	,	of	course	,	 tackle 	 s 	 	the	 big 	 gest 	 	assumption	of	all	,	that	business	is	business	,	and	 philanthro 	 py 	 	is	the	vehicle	of	people	who	want	to	create	change	in	the	world	.
Xigi	is	a	new	community	 s 	 ite 	 	that	's	built	by	the	community	,	 link 	 ing 	 	and	mapping	 th 	 is 	 	new	social	capital	market	.
It	 list 	 s 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	1,000	 ent 	 ities 	 	that	are	 off 	 er 	 ing 	 	debt	and	 equ 	 ity 	 	for	social	enterprise	.
So	we	can	look	to	these	 innov 	 ators 	 	to	help	us	remember	that	if	we	can	leverage	even	a	small	amount	of	the	capital	that	 seek 	 s 	 	a	return	,	the	good	that	can	be	driven	could	be	 astonish 	 ing 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	what	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	here	is	that	we	're	not	 think 	 ing 	 	our	way	 in 	 to 	 	a	new	way	of	 act 	 ing 	 	;	we	're	 act 	 ing 	 	our	way	 in 	 to 	 	a	new	way	of	 think 	 ing 	 	.
 Phil 	 anthro 	 py 	 	is	 re 	 organ 	 izing 	 	 it 	 self 	 	before	our	 ver 	 y 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	.
And	even	 th 	 ough 	 	all	of	the	 experiment 	 s 	 	and	all	of	the	big	 giver 	 s 	 	do	n't	yet	fulfill	 th 	 is 	 	 aspir 	 ation 	 	,	I	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	new	 zeitge 	 ist 	 	:	open	,	big	,	fast	,	 connect 	 ed 	 	,	and	,	let	us	 al 	 so 	 	hope	,	long	.
We	have	got	to	 real 	 ize 	 	that	it	is	going	to	take	a	long	time	to	do	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
If	we	do	n't	develop	the	 stam 	 ina 	 	to	stick	with	 thing 	 s 	 	--	 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	you	pick	,	stick	with	it	--	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	is	just	going	to	be	,	you	know	,	a	fad	.
But	I	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 hope 	 ful 	 	.
And	I	'm	 hope 	 ful 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 philanthro 	 py 	 	that	's	 re 	 organ 	 izing 	 	 it 	 self 	 	,	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	whole	other	 port 	 ions 	 	of	the	social	sector	,	and	of	business	,	that	are	 bus 	 y 	 	 challeng 	 ing 	 	``	business	 a 	 s 	 	usual	.	''
And	 every 	 where 	 	I	go	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	here	at	TED	,	I	feel	that	there	is	a	new	moral	 hung 	 er 	 	that	is	growing	.
What	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	is	people	 re 	 ally 	 	 wrestl 	 ing 	 	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	what	is	 th 	 is 	 	new	thing	that	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
 Word 	 s 	 	like	``	 philanthro 	 capital 	 ism 	 	,	''	and	``	natural	 capital 	 ism 	 	,	''	and	``	 philanthro 	 entrepreneur 	 	,	''	and	``	venture	 philanthro 	 py 	 	.	''
We	do	n't	have	a	language	for	it	yet	.
 What 	 ever 	 	we	call	it	,	it	's	new	,	it	's	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	and	I	think	it	's	gong	to	 quit 	 e 	 	significant	.
And	that	's	where	my	 imagin 	 ed 	 	future	 come 	 s 	 	in	,	which	I	am	going	to	call	the	social	 s 	 ing 	 ular 	 ity 	 	.
 Man 	 y 	 	of	you	will	 real 	 ize 	 	that	I	'm	 rip 	 ping 	 	a	bit	off	of	the	science	fiction	writer	 Ver 	 nor 	 	 V 	 ing 	 e 	 	's	 not 	 ion 	 	of	a	 techno 	 logical 	 	 s 	 ing 	 ular 	 ity 	 	,	where	a	number	of	 trend 	 s 	 	 accele 	 rate 	 	and	 converg 	 e 	 	and	come	together	to	create	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	a	 shock 	 ing 	 ly 	 	new	 re 	 ality 	 	.
It	may	be	that	the	social	 s 	 ing 	 ular 	 ity 	 	 a 	 head 	 	is	the	one	that	we	fear	the	most	:	a	 converg 	 ence 	 	of	 catastroph 	 es 	 	,	of	 environment 	 al 	 	degradation	,	of	 weapon 	 s 	 	of	mass	 destruct 	 ion 	 	,	of	 pan 	 demic 	 s 	 	,	of	poverty	.
That	's	 be 	 cause 	 	our	ability	to	confront	the	 problem 	 s 	 	that	we	face	 ha 	 s 	 	not	 ke 	 pt 	 	pace	with	our	ability	to	create	them	.
And	 a 	 s 	 	we	've	heard	here	,	it	is	no	 exagge 	 ration 	 	to	say	that	we	hold	the	future	of	our	 civil 	 ization 	 	in	our	 hand 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	never	before	.
The	question	is	,	is	there	a	positive	social	 s 	 ing 	 ular 	 ity 	 	?
 I 	 s 	 	there	a	 front 	 ier 	 	for	us	of	how	we	live	together	?
Our	future	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	to	be	 imagin 	 ed 	 	.
We	can	create	a	future	where	hope	and	 histo 	 ry 	 	 rhym 	 e 	 	.
But	we	have	a	problem	.
Our	experience	to	date	,	both	 individual 	 ly 	 	and	 collect 	 ively 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	prepared	us	for	what	we	're	going	to	need	to	do	,	or	who	we	're	going	to	need	to	be	.
We	are	going	to	need	a	new	generation	of	citizen	 lead 	 ers 	 	 will 	 ing 	 	to	commit	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	to	growing	and	changing	and	 learn 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 rapid 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	possible	.
That	's	why	I	have	one	last	thing	I	want	to	show	you	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	photograph	taken	about	100	 year 	 s 	 	ago	of	my	 grand 	 father 	 	and	 great 	 - 	 grand 	 father 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	 news 	 paper 	 	 publish 	 er 	 	and	a	 bank 	 er 	 	.
And	they	 we 	 re 	 	great	community	 lead 	 ers 	 	.
And	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	great	 philanthro 	 pist 	 s 	 	.
I	keep	 th 	 is 	 	photograph	close	by	to	me	--	it	's	in	my	 off 	 ice 	 	--	 be 	 cause 	 	I	've	 al 	 ways 	 	felt	a	 mystic 	 al 	 	 connect 	 ion 	 	to	these	two	men	,	both	of	whom	I	never	 k 	 new 	 	.
And	so	,	in	 the 	 ir 	 	honor	,	I	want	to	 off 	 er 	 	you	 th 	 is 	 	blank	slide	.
And	I	want	you	to	imagine	that	 th 	 is 	 	a	photograph	of	you	.
And	I	want	you	to	think	about	the	community	that	you	want	to	be	part	of	creating	.
 What 	 ever 	 	that	 mean 	 s 	 	to	you	.
And	I	want	you	to	imagine	that	it	's	100	 year 	 s 	 	from	now	,	and	your	 grand 	 child 	 	,	or	 great 	 - 	 grand 	 child 	 	,	or	niece	or	nephew	or	 god 	 - 	 child 	 	,	is	looking	at	 th 	 is 	 	photograph	of	you	.
What	is	the	story	you	most	want	for	them	to	tell	?
Thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
I	 believ 	 e 	 	that	there	are	new	,	 hid 	 den 	 	 tension 	 s 	 	that	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	between	people	and	 institution 	 s 	 	--	 institution 	 s 	 	that	are	the	 institution 	 s 	 	that	people	inhabit	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 dai 	 ly 	 	life	:	 school 	 s 	 	,	 hospital 	 s 	 	,	 work 	 place 	 s 	 	,	 factor 	 ies 	 	,	 off 	 ice 	 s 	 	,	etc	.
And	 some 	 thing 	 	that	I	see	 happen 	 ing 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	I	would	like	to	call	a	sort	of	``	 democrat 	 ization 	 	of	 in 	 timacy 	 	.	''
And	what	do	I	mean	by	that	?
I	mean	that	what	people	are	 do 	 ing 	 	is	,	in	fact	,	they	are	sort	of	,	with	 the 	 ir 	 	communication	 channel 	 s 	 	,	they	are	 break 	 ing 	 	an	 impose 	 d 	 	 isol 	 ation 	 	that	these	 institution 	 s 	 	are	 im 	 posing 	 	on	them	.
How	are	they	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	?	 The 	 y 	 	're	 do 	 ing 	 	it	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	way	,	by	 call 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	mom	from	work	,	by	 IM 	 ing 	 	from	 the 	 ir 	 	 off 	 ice 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 friend 	 s 	 	,	by	 text 	 ing 	 	under	the	desk	.
The	 picture 	 s 	 	that	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	me	are	people	that	I	 visit 	 ed 	 	in	the	last	few	 month 	 s 	 	.
And	I	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	to	come	 a 	 long 	 	with	the	person	they	communicate	with	most	.
And	 some 	 body 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	a	boyfriend	,	 some 	 body 	 	a	father	.
One	young	woman	 br 	 ought 	 	her	 grand 	 father 	 	.
For	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	I	've	 be 	 en 	 	looking	at	how	people	use	 channel 	 s 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	email	,	the	mobile	phone	,	 text 	 ing 	 	,	etc	.
What	we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	going	to	see	is	that	,	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	,	people	are	 commun 	 ic 	 ating 	 	on	a	regular	 bas 	 is 	 	with	five	,	six	,	seven	of	 the 	 ir 	 	most	 intima 	 te 	 	sphere	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	lets	take	some	data	.	Facebook	.
 Re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	some	 socio 	 logists 	 	from	Facebook	--	Facebook	is	the	channel	that	you	would	expect	is	the	most	 enlarg 	 en 	 ing 	 	of	all	 channel 	 s 	 	.
And	an	average	user	,	 s 	 aid 	 	 Cam 	 er 	 on 	 	 Mar 	 low 	 	,	from	Facebook	,	 ha 	 s 	 	about	120	 friend 	 s 	 	.
But	he	 actual 	 ly 	 	 talk 	 s 	 	to	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 two 	 - 	 way 	 	 ex 	 change 	 s 	 	with	,	about	four	to	six	people	on	a	regular	base	,	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	his	gender	.
 A 	 ca 	 demic 	 	research	on	instant	 mess 	 aging 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 show 	 s 	 	100	people	on	 bud 	 dy 	 	 list 	 s 	 	,	but	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	people	chat	with	two	,	three	,	four	--	 any 	 way 	 	,	less	than	five	.
My	own	research	on	 cell 	 phone 	 s 	 	and	voice	 call 	 s 	 	 show 	 s 	 	that	80	percent	of	the	 call 	 s 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	made	to	four	people	.	80	percent	.
And	when	you	go	to	 Sky 	 pe 	 	,	it	's	down	to	two	people	.
A	lot	of	 socio 	 logists 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	are	 quit 	 e 	 	 disappoint 	 ed 	 	.
I	mean	,	I	've	 be 	 en 	 	a	bit	 disappoint 	 ed 	 	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	when	I	saw	 th 	 is 	 	data	and	all	 th 	 is 	 	 deploy 	 ment 	 	,	just	for	five	people	.
And	some	 socio 	 logists 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	feel	that	it	's	a	closure	,	it	's	a	 cocoon 	 ing 	 	,	that	we	're	 dis 	 engag 	 ing 	 	from	the	public	.
And	I	would	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	I	would	like	to	show	you	that	if	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	look	at	who	is	 do 	 ing 	 	it	,	and	from	where	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	it	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	there	is	an	 in 	 credible 	 	social	 transform 	 ation 	 	.
There	are	three	 st 	 ories 	 	that	I	think	are	 quit 	 e 	 	good	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
The	first	 gentle 	 man 	 	,	he	's	a	 bake 	 r 	 	.
And	so	he	 start 	 s 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	every	 morn 	 ing 	 	at	four	 o 	 ' 	 clock 	 	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
And	around	eight	 o 	 ' 	 clock 	 	he	sort	of	 sneak 	 s 	 	away	from	his	oven	,	 clean 	 s 	 	his	 hand 	 s 	 	from	the	flour	and	 call 	 s 	 	his	wife	.
He	just	 want 	 s 	 	to	wish	her	a	good	day	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	the	start	of	her	day	.
And	I	've	heard	 th 	 is 	 	story	a	number	of	 time 	 s 	 	.
A	young	 factor 	 y 	 	 work 	 er 	 	who	 work 	 s 	 	night	 shift 	 s 	 	,	who	 manage 	 s 	 	to	sneak	away	from	the	 factor 	 y 	 	floor	,	where	there	is	 CC 	 TV 	 	by	the	way	,	and	find	a	corner	,	where	at	11	 o 	 ' 	 clock 	 	at	night	he	can	call	his	girlfriend	and	just	say	 good 	 night 	 	.
Or	a	mother	who	,	at	four	 o 	 ' 	 clock 	 	,	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 manage 	 s 	 	to	find	a	corner	in	the	toilet	to	check	that	her	children	are	 safe 	 ly 	 	home	.
 Th 	 en 	 	there	is	 an 	 other 	 	couple	,	there	is	a	 Brazil 	 ian 	 	couple	.
 The 	 y 	 	've	lived	in	 It 	 a 	 ly 	 	for	a	number	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	 Sky 	 pe 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	a	few	 time 	 s 	 	a	week	.
But	once	a	 fort 	 night 	 	,	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	put	the	computer	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 din 	 ing 	 	table	,	pull	out	the	 web 	 cam 	 	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	 d 	 inner 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	family	in	 Sa 	 o 	 	 Paul 	 o 	 	.	And	they	have	a	big	event	of	it	.
And	I	heard	 th 	 is 	 	story	the	first	time	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	from	a	 ver 	 y 	 	modest	family	of	 im 	 migrant 	 s 	 	from	Kosovo	in	 Switzer 	 land 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	had	set	up	a	big	screen	in	 the 	 ir 	 	living	room	,	and	every	 morn 	 ing 	 	they	had	 break 	 fast 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 grand 	 mother 	 	.
But	 Dan 	 ny 	 	 Mill 	 er 	 	,	who	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 anthropo 	 logist 	 	who	is	 work 	 ing 	 	on	Filipina	migrant	women	who	 leav 	 e 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	children	back	in	the	 Philip 	 pine 	 s 	 	,	was	 tell 	 ing 	 	me	about	how	much	 parent 	 ing 	 	is	going	on	through	 Sky 	 pe 	 	,	and	how	much	these	 mother 	 s 	 	are	 engag 	 ed 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	children	through	 Sky 	 pe 	 	.
And	then	there	is	the	third	couple	.	 The 	 y 	 	are	two	 friend 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	chat	to	each	other	every	day	,	a	few	 time 	 s 	 	a	day	 actual 	 ly 	 	.
And	 final 	 ly 	 	,	 final 	 ly 	 	,	they	've	 manage 	 d 	 	to	put	instant	 mess 	 aging 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	at	work	.
And	now	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	they	have	it	open	.
 When 	 ever 	 	they	have	a	moment	they	chat	to	each	other	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	with	 teenager 	 s 	 	and	 kid 	 s 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	it	in	school	,	under	the	table	,	and	 text 	 ing 	 	under	the	table	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 friend 	 s 	 	.
So	,	 non 	 e 	 	of	these	 case 	 s 	 	are	 un 	 ique 	 	.
I	mean	,	I	could	tell	you	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	them	.
But	what	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 exception 	 al 	 	is	the	setting	.
So	,	think	of	the	three	 setting 	 s 	 	I	've	 talk 	 ed 	 	to	you	about	:	 factor 	 y 	 	,	 migr 	 ation 	 	,	 off 	 ice 	 	.
But	it	could	be	in	a	school	,	it	could	be	an	 administr 	 ation 	 	,	it	could	be	a	hospital	.
Three	 setting 	 s 	 	that	,	if	we	just	step	back	15	 year 	 s 	 	,	if	you	just	think	back	15	 year 	 s 	 	,	when	you	 clock 	 ed 	 	in	,	when	you	 clock 	 ed 	 	in	to	an	 off 	 ice 	 	,	when	you	 clock 	 ed 	 	in	to	a	 factor 	 y 	 	,	there	was	no	contact	for	the	whole	 dur 	 ation 	 	of	the	time	,	there	was	no	contact	with	your	private	sphere	.
If	you	 we 	 re 	 	 luck 	 y 	 	there	was	a	public	phone	 hang 	 ing 	 	in	the	corridor	or	 some 	 where 	 	.
If	you	 we 	 re 	 	in	management	,	oh	,	that	was	a	different	story	.
 May 	 be 	 	you	had	a	direct	line	.
If	you	 we 	 re 	 	not	,	you	 may 	 be 	 	had	to	go	through	an	 oper 	 ator 	 	.
But	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	when	you	 walk 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 building 	 s 	 	,	the	private	sphere	was	left	 be 	 hind 	 	you	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	a	norm	of	our	professional	 live 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	a	norm	and	 s 	 uch 	 	an	 expect 	 ation 	 	.
And	it	had	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	technical	 cap 	 ability 	 	.
The	 phone 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	there	.	But	the	 expect 	 ation 	 	was	once	you	 move 	 d 	 	in	there	your	 commit 	 ment 	 	was	fully	to	the	task	at	hand	,	fully	to	the	people	around	you	.
That	was	where	the	focus	had	to	be	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	a	cultural	norm	that	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	school	our	children	for	them	to	be	 cap 	 able 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	 clea 	 vage 	 	.
If	you	think	 nurse 	 ry 	 	,	 kind 	 ergarten 	 	,	first	 year 	 s 	 	of	school	are	just	 dedicate 	 d 	 	to	take	away	the	children	,	to	make	them	used	to	 stay 	 ing 	 	long	 hour 	 s 	 	away	from	 the 	 ir 	 	family	.
And	then	the	school	 enact 	 s 	 	 perfect 	 ly 	 	well	.
It	 mimic 	 s 	 	 perfect 	 ly 	 	all	the	 ritual 	 s 	 	that	we	will	find	in	 off 	 ice 	 s 	 	:	 ritual 	 s 	 	of	entry	,	 ritual 	 s 	 	of	exit	,	the	 schedule 	 s 	 	,	the	 uniform 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	,	 thing 	 s 	 	that	identify	you	,	 team 	 - 	 building 	 	 activ 	 ities 	 	,	team	building	that	will	allow	you	to	 bas 	 ically 	 	be	with	a	random	group	of	 kid 	 s 	 	,	or	a	random	group	of	people	that	you	will	have	to	be	with	for	a	number	of	time	.
And	of	course	,	the	major	thing	:	learn	to	pay	attention	,	to	 concent 	 rate 	 	and	focus	your	attention	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	about	150	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
It	 on 	 ly 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	with	the	birth	of	modern	 bureau 	 cracy 	 	,	and	of	industrial	revolution	.
When	people	 bas 	 ically 	 	had	to	go	 some 	 where 	 	else	to	work	and	carry	out	the	work	.
And	when	with	modern	 bureau 	 cracy 	 	there	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	rational	approach	,	where	there	was	a	clear	 distinct 	 ion 	 	between	the	private	sphere	and	the	public	sphere	.
So	,	 un 	 til 	 	then	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	people	 we 	 re 	 	living	on	top	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 trade 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	 we 	 re 	 	living	on	top	of	the	land	they	 we 	 re 	 	 labor 	 ing 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	 we 	 re 	 	living	on	top	of	the	 work 	 shop 	 s 	 	where	they	 we 	 re 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	.
And	if	you	think	,	it	's	 permeate 	 d 	 	our	whole	culture	,	even	our	cities	.
If	you	think	of	 med 	 ieval 	 	cities	,	 med 	 ieval 	 	cities	the	 bo 	 rough 	 s 	 	all	have	the	 name 	 s 	 	of	the	 guild 	 s 	 	and	 profession 	 s 	 	that	lived	there	.
 N 	 ow 	 	we	have	 sprawl 	 ing 	 	 resident 	 ial 	 	 suburb 	 ia 	 s 	 	that	are	well	distinct	from	production	 area 	 s 	 	and	commercial	 area 	 s 	 	.
And	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	over	these	150	 year 	 s 	 	,	there	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	clear	class	system	that	 al 	 so 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 emerge 	 d 	 	.
So	the	lower	the	 stat 	 us 	 	of	the	job	and	of	the	person	 carry 	 ing 	 	out	,	the	more	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	he	would	be	from	his	personal	sphere	.
People	have	taken	 th 	 is 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	in	contact	all	through	the	day	or	in	all	 type 	 s 	 	of	 situ 	 ations 	 	.
And	they	are	 do 	 ing 	 	it	 massive 	 ly 	 	.
The	 Pe 	 w 	 	Institute	,	which	 produce 	 s 	 	good	data	on	a	regular	 bas 	 is 	 	on	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	in	the	 Stat 	 es 	 	,	 say 	 s 	 	that	--	and	I	think	that	 th 	 is 	 	number	is	 conserv 	 ative 	 	--	50	percent	of	 any 	 body 	 	with	email	access	at	work	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	private	email	from	his	 off 	 ice 	 	.
I	 re 	 ally 	 	think	that	the	number	is	 conserv 	 ative 	 	.
In	my	own	research	,	we	saw	that	the	peak	for	private	email	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	11	 o 	 ' 	 clock 	 	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	 what 	 ever 	 	the	country	.
75	percent	of	people	admit	 do 	 ing 	 	private	 conversation 	 s 	 	from	work	on	 the 	 ir 	 	mobile	 phone 	 s 	 	.
100	percent	are	using	text	.
The	point	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 - 	 appropri 	 ation 	 	of	the	personal	sphere	is	not	 terr 	 ibly 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	with	all	 institution 	 s 	 	.
I	'm	 al 	 ways 	 	 surprise 	 d 	 	the	U.S.	 Arm 	 y 	 	 socio 	 logists 	 	are	 discuss 	 ing 	 	of	the	impact	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	of	 soldier 	 s 	 	in	Iraq	 hav 	 ing 	 	 dai 	 ly 	 	contact	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	.
But	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 institution 	 s 	 	that	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 block 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	access	.
And	every	day	,	every	single	day	,	I	read	news	that	 make 	 s 	 	me	 cr 	 ing 	 e 	 	,	like	a	$	15	fine	to	 kid 	 s 	 	in	Texas	,	for	using	,	every	time	they	take	out	 the 	 ir 	 	mobile	phone	in	school	.
 Im 	 mediate 	 	 dismiss 	 al 	 	to	bus	 driver 	 s 	 	in	New	York	,	if	 s 	 een 	 	with	a	mobile	phone	in	a	hand	.
 Comp 	 anie 	 s 	 	 block 	 ing 	 	access	to	IM	or	to	Facebook	.
 Be 	 hind 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	of	security	and	 safe 	 ty 	 	,	which	have	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	the	 argument 	 s 	 	for	social	control	,	in	fact	what	is	going	on	is	that	these	 institution 	 s 	 	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	decide	who	,	in	fact	,	 ha 	 s 	 	a	right	to	self	determine	 the 	 ir 	 	attention	,	to	decide	,	 whet 	 her 	 	they	should	,	or	not	,	be	 isolate 	 d 	 	.
And	they	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	block	,	in	a	certain	sense	,	 th 	 is 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	of	a	 great 	 er 	 	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	 in 	 timacy 	 	.
So	 to 	 day 	 	,	I	'm	going	to	tell	you	about	some	people	who	did	n't	move	out	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 neighbor 	 hood 	 s 	 	.
The	first	one	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	right	here	in	 Chi 	 cago 	 	.
 Bren 	 da 	 	 Palm 	 s 	 - 	 Far 	 ber 	 	was	 hire 	 d 	 	to	help	 ex 	 - 	 convict 	 s 	 	 re 	 enter 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	and	keep	them	from	going	back	 in 	 to 	 	 pri 	 son 	 	.
 Current 	 ly 	 	,	 taxpayer 	 s 	 	 s 	 pend 	 	about	60,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	per	year	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	a	person	to	jail	.
We	know	that	 two 	 - 	 third 	 s 	 	of	them	are	going	to	go	back	.
I	find	it	 interest 	 ing 	 	that	,	for	every	one	dollar	we	 s 	 pend 	 	,	 how 	 ever 	 	,	on	early	 child 	 hood 	 	education	,	like	Head	Start	,	we	 s 	 ave 	 	17	 dollar 	 s 	 	on	stuff	like	 incarce 	 ration 	 	in	the	future	.
Or	--	think	about	it	--	that	60,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	is	more	than	what	it	 cost 	 s 	 	to	 s 	 end 	 	one	person	to	Harvard	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
But	 Bren 	 da 	 	,	not	 be 	 ing 	 	 phase 	 d 	 	by	stuff	like	that	,	took	a	look	at	her	 challeng 	 e 	 	and	came	up	with	a	 not 	 - 	 so 	 - 	 obvious 	 	solution	:	create	a	business	that	 produce 	 s 	 	skin	care	 product 	 s 	 	from	honey	.
 Oka 	 y 	 	,	it	might	be	obvious	to	some	of	you	;	it	was	n't	to	me	.
It	's	the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	growing	a	form	of	social	 innov 	 ation 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	real	potential	.
She	 hire 	 d 	 	 seem 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 un 	 employ 	 able 	 	men	and	women	to	care	for	the	bees	,	harvest	the	honey	and	make	 value 	 - 	 add 	 ed 	 	 product 	 s 	 	that	they	 market 	 ed 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	and	that	 we 	 re 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	 s 	 old 	 	at	 W 	 hole 	 	 Food 	 s 	 	.
She	 combine 	 d 	 	 employ 	 ment 	 	experience	and	training	with	life	 skill 	 s 	 	they	 need 	 ed 	 	,	like	 anger 	 - 	 management 	 	and	 team 	 work 	 	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	how	to	talk	to	future	 employ 	 ers 	 	about	how	 the 	 ir 	 	 experience 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 demonst 	 rated 	 	the	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	that	they	had	 learn 	 ed 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 eager 	 ness 	 	to	learn	more	.
 Les 	 s 	 	than	four	percent	of	the	 folk 	 s 	 	that	went	through	her	program	 actual 	 ly 	 	go	back	to	jail	.
So	these	young	men	and	women	 learn 	 ed 	 	 job 	 - 	 read 	 iness 	 	and	life	 skill 	 s 	 	through	bee	 keep 	 ing 	 	and	 be 	 came 	 	productive	 citizen 	 s 	 	in	the	process	.
Talk	about	a	sweet	 begin 	 ning 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	I	'm	going	to	take	you	to	 Lo 	 s 	 	 Angel 	 es 	 	,	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	people	know	that	 L. 	 A. 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	.
But	I	'm	going	to	talk	about	 L. 	 A. 	 	's	water	 issue 	 s 	 	right	now	.
 The 	 y 	 	have	not	 en 	 ough 	 	water	on	most	 day 	 s 	 	and	too	much	to	handle	when	it	 rain 	 s 	 	.
 Current 	 ly 	 	,	20	percent	of	California	's	energy	consumption	is	used	to	pump	water	 in 	 to 	 	 most 	 ly 	 	 South 	 ern 	 	California	.
 T 	 heir 	 	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	 load 	 s 	 	,	 load 	 s 	 	,	to	channel	that	 rain 	 water 	 	out	 in 	 to 	 	the	ocean	when	it	 rain 	 s 	 	and	 flood 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
 N 	 ow 	 	 And 	 y 	 	 Lip 	 ki 	 s 	 	is	 work 	 ing 	 	to	help	 L. 	 A. 	 	cut	 infra 	 structure 	 	 cost 	 s 	 	 associate 	 d 	 	with	water	management	and	urban	heat	 is 	 land 	 	--	 link 	 ing 	 	 tree 	 s 	 	,	people	and	technology	to	create	a	more	 liv 	 able 	 	city	.
All	that	green	stuff	 actual 	 ly 	 	 natural 	 ly 	 	 absorb 	 s 	 	storm	water	,	 al 	 so 	 	 help 	 s 	 	cool	our	cities	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	,	come	to	think	about	it	,	do	you	 re 	 ally 	 	want	 air 	 - 	 condition 	 ing 	 	,	or	is	it	a	 cool 	 er 	 	room	that	you	want	?
How	you	get	it	should	n't	make	that	much	of	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
So	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 L. 	 A. 	 	 Count 	 y 	 	 decide 	 d 	 	that	they	 need 	 ed 	 	to	 s 	 pend 	 	2.5	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	to	repair	the	city	 school 	 s 	 	.
And	 And 	 y 	 	and	his	team	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	 s 	 pend 	 	200	million	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 dollar 	 s 	 	on	asphalt	to	surround	the	 school 	 s 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
And	by	 present 	 ing 	 	a	 re 	 ally 	 	strong	economic	case	,	they	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	the	 L. 	 A. 	 	government	that	 re 	 placing 	 	that	asphalt	with	 tree 	 s 	 	and	other	 green 	 ery 	 	,	that	the	 school 	 s 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	would	 s 	 ave 	 	the	system	more	on	energy	than	they	 s 	 pend 	 	on	 horti 	 cultural 	 	 infra 	 structure 	 	.
So	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	,	20	million	square	feet	of	asphalt	was	 replace 	 d 	 	or	 avoid 	 ed 	 	,	and	 electric 	 al 	 	consumption	for	 air 	 - 	 condition 	 ing 	 	went	down	,	while	 employ 	 ment 	 	for	people	to	maintain	 t 	 hose 	 	 ground 	 s 	 	went	up	,	 result 	 ing 	 	in	a	 net 	 - 	 saving 	 s 	 	to	the	system	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	 health 	 ier 	 	 student 	 s 	 	and	 school 	 s 	 	system	 employ 	 ees 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
 N 	 ow 	 	 Ju 	 dy 	 	 Bond 	 s 	 	is	a	coal	 min 	 er 	 	's	daughter	.
Her	family	 ha 	 s 	 	eight	 generation 	 s 	 	in	a	town	 call 	 ed 	 	 White 	 s 	 ville 	 	,	West	 Virgin 	 ia 	 	.
And	if	 any 	 one 	 	should	be	 cl 	 ing 	 ing 	 	to	the	 form 	 er 	 	 glor 	 y 	 	of	the	coal	 min 	 ing 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	and	of	the	town	,	it	should	be	 Ju 	 dy 	 	.
But	the	way	coal	is	 min 	 ed 	 	right	now	is	different	from	the	deep	 mine 	 s 	 	that	her	father	and	her	father	's	father	would	go	down	 in 	 to 	 	and	that	 employ 	 ed 	 	 essential 	 ly 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	and	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	two	dozen	men	can	tear	down	a	mountain	in	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 month 	 s 	 	,	and	 on 	 ly 	 	for	about	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	'	worth	of	coal	.
That	kind	of	technology	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 mountain 	 top 	 	removal	.	''
It	can	make	a	mountain	go	from	 th 	 is 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	in	a	few	short	 month 	 s 	 	.
Just	imagine	that	the	air	 surround 	 ing 	 	these	 place 	 s 	 	--	it	's	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	the	residue	of	 explosive 	 s 	 	and	coal	.
When	we	 visit 	 ed 	 	,	it	 g 	 ave 	 	some	of	the	people	we	 we 	 re 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	strange	little	cough	after	 be 	 ing 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	there	for	just	a	few	 hour 	 s 	 	or	so	--	not	just	 min 	 ers 	 	,	but	 every 	 body 	 	.
And	 Ju 	 dy 	 	saw	her	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 destroy 	 ed 	 	and	her	water	 poison 	 ed 	 	.
And	the	coal	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	just	move	on	after	the	mountain	was	 empti 	 ed 	 	,	 leav 	 ing 	 	even	more	 un 	 employ 	 ment 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	wake	.
But	she	 al 	 so 	 	saw	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	in	potential	wind	energy	on	an	 in 	 tact 	 	mountain	,	and	one	that	was	 reduc 	 ed 	 	in	 elev 	 ation 	 	by	over	2,000	feet	.
Three	 year 	 s 	 	of	 dirt 	 y 	 	energy	with	not	 man 	 y 	 	 job 	 s 	 	,	or	centuries	of	clean	energy	with	the	potential	for	 develop 	 ing 	 	 expert 	 ise 	 	and	 improve 	 ments 	 	in	efficiency	based	on	technical	 skill 	 s 	 	,	and	 develop 	 ing 	 	local	knowledge	about	how	to	get	the	most	out	of	that	region	's	wind	.
She	 calcul 	 ated 	 	the	 up 	 - 	 front 	 	cost	and	the	 pay 	 back 	 	over	time	,	and	it	's	a	 net 	 - 	 plus 	 	on	so	 man 	 y 	 	 level 	 s 	 	for	the	local	,	national	and	global	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
It	's	a	 long 	 er 	 	 pay 	 back 	 	than	 mountain 	 top 	 	removal	,	but	the	wind	energy	 actual 	 ly 	 	 pay 	 s 	 	back	 fore 	 ver 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	 mountain 	 top 	 	removal	 pay 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	little	money	to	the	 local 	 s 	 	,	and	it	 give 	 s 	 	them	a	lot	of	 mis 	 ery 	 	.
The	water	is	 turn 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 go 	 o 	 	.
 Mo 	 st 	 	people	are	still	 un 	 employ 	 ed 	 	,	 lead 	 ing 	 	to	most	of	the	same	 kind 	 s 	 	of	social	 problem 	 s 	 	that	 un 	 employ 	 ed 	 	people	in	inner	cities	 al 	 so 	 	experience	--	drug	and	alcohol	abuse	,	domestic	abuse	,	teen	 pregn 	 ancy 	 	and	poor	heath	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
 N 	 ow 	 	 Ju 	 dy 	 	and	I	--	I	have	to	say	--	 total 	 ly 	 	related	to	each	other	.
Not	 quit 	 e 	 	an	obvious	alliance	.
I	mean	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	her	 home 	 town 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	 White 	 s 	 ville 	 	,	West	 Virgin 	 ia 	 	.
I	mean	,	they	are	not	--	they	ai	n't	 com 	 pet 	 ing 	 	for	the	 birth 	 place 	 	of	hip	hop	title	or	 any 	 thing 	 	like	that	.
But	the	back	of	my	 T 	 - 	 shirt 	 	,	the	one	that	she	 g 	 ave 	 	me	,	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 Sav 	 e 	 	the	 en 	 danger 	 ed 	 	 hill 	 bill 	 ies 	 	.	''
So	 home 	 girl 	 s 	 	and	 hill 	 bill 	 ies 	 	we	got	it	together	and	 total 	 ly 	 	understand	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	's	all	about	.
But	just	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	ago	,	 Ju 	 dy 	 	was	 diagnos 	 ed 	 	with	 stage 	 - 	 three 	 	lung	cancer	.
Yeah	.
And	it	 ha 	 s 	 	since	 move 	 d 	 	to	her	 bone 	 s 	 	and	her	brain	.
And	I	just	find	it	so	bizarre	that	she	's	 suffer 	 ing 	 	from	the	same	thing	that	she	 tri 	 ed 	 	so	hard	to	protect	people	from	.
But	her	dream	of	 Co 	 al 	 	River	 Mount 	 ain 	 	Wind	is	her	 leg 	 acy 	 	.
And	she	might	not	get	to	see	that	 mountain 	 top 	 	.
But	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	writing	yet	some	kind	of	 manifest 	 o 	 	or	 some 	 thing 	 	,	she	's	 leav 	 ing 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	a	business	plan	to	make	it	happen	.
That	's	what	my	 home 	 girl 	 	is	 do 	 ing 	 	.
So	I	'm	so	proud	of	that	.
But	these	three	people	do	n't	know	each	other	,	but	they	do	have	an	awful	lot	in	common	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	all	problem	 solve 	 rs 	 	,	and	they	're	just	some	of	the	 man 	 y 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	that	I	 re 	 ally 	 	am	 privilege 	 d 	 	to	see	,	meet	and	learn	from	in	the	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	the	work	that	I	do	now	.
I	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 luck 	 y 	 	to	have	them	all	 feature 	 d 	 	on	my	 Corp 	 or 	 ation 	 	for	 Pub 	 lic 	 	Radio	radio	show	 call 	 ed 	 	 The 	 Pro 	 mis 	 ed 	 Land 	 .org 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	they	're	all	 ver 	 y 	 	practical	 vision 	 aries 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	take	a	look	at	the	 demand 	 s 	 	that	are	out	there	--	 beaut 	 y 	 	 product 	 s 	 	,	 health 	 y 	 	 school 	 s 	 	,	 electric 	 ity 	 	--	and	how	the	money	's	 flow 	 ing 	 	to	meet	 t 	 hose 	 	 demand 	 s 	 	.
And	when	the	 cheap 	 est 	 	 solution 	 s 	 	involve	 reduc 	 ing 	 	the	number	of	 job 	 s 	 	,	you	're	left	with	 un 	 employ 	 ed 	 	people	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	people	are	n't	cheap	.
In	fact	,	they	make	up	some	of	what	I	call	the	most	expensive	 citizen 	 s 	 	,	and	they	include	 generation 	 ally 	 	 imp 	 over 	 ish 	 ed 	 	,	 trauma 	 t 	 ized 	 	 vet 	 s 	 	 return 	 ing 	 	from	the	Middle	East	,	people	coming	out	of	jail	.
And	for	the	 veteran 	 s 	 	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	the	 V. 	 A 	 	.	 s 	 aid 	 	there	's	a	 six 	 - 	 fold 	 	 in 	 crease 	 	in	mental	health	 pharmaceutical 	 s 	 	by	 vet 	 s 	 	since	2003	.
I	think	that	number	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	going	to	go	up	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	not	the	largest	number	of	people	,	but	they	are	some	of	the	most	expensive	--	and	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	 like 	 li 	 hood 	 	for	domestic	abuse	,	drug	and	alcohol	abuse	,	poor	performance	by	 the 	 ir 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	in	 school 	 s 	 	and	 al 	 so 	 	poor	health	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	of	stress	.
So	these	three	 guy 	 s 	 	all	understand	how	to	 productive 	 ly 	 	channel	 dollar 	 s 	 	through	our	local	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	to	meet	 exist 	 ing 	 	market	 demand 	 s 	 	,	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	social	 problem 	 s 	 	that	we	have	now	and	prevent	new	 problem 	 s 	 	in	the	future	.
And	there	are	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	other	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	like	that	.
One	problem	:	waste	 hand 	 ling 	 	and	 un 	 employ 	 ment 	 	.
Even	when	we	think	or	talk	about	 recycl 	 ing 	 	,	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 recycl 	 able 	 	stuff	 end 	 s 	 	up	 get 	 ting 	 	 inciner 	 ated 	 	or	in	 land 	 fill 	 s 	 	and	 leav 	 ing 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 municipal 	 ities 	 	,	 divers 	 ion 	 	rates	--	they	 leav 	 e 	 	much	to	be	 recycl 	 ed 	 	.
And	where	is	 th 	 is 	 	waste	 handle 	 d 	 	?	 Us 	 ual 	 ly 	 	in	poor	 commun 	 ities 	 	.
And	we	know	that	 eco 	 - 	 industrial 	 	business	,	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	business	 model 	 s 	 	--	there	's	a	model	in	 Euro 	 pe 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 eco 	 - 	 industrial 	 	park	,	where	either	the	waste	of	one	company	is	the	raw	material	for	 an 	 other 	 	,	or	you	use	 recycl 	 ed 	 	 material 	 s 	 	to	make	 good 	 s 	 	that	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	use	and	sell	.
We	can	create	these	local	 market 	 s 	 	and	 incentive 	 s 	 	for	 recycl 	 ed 	 	 material 	 s 	 	to	be	used	 a 	 s 	 	raw	 material 	 s 	 	for	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	.
And	in	my	 home 	 town 	 	,	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	do	one	of	these	in	the	Bronx	,	but	our	mayor	 decide 	 d 	 	what	he	 want 	 ed 	 	to	see	was	a	jail	on	that	same	spot	.
 Fort 	 un 	 ate 	 ly 	 	--	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	create	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 job 	 s 	 	--	but	after	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	,	the	city	 want 	 ed 	 	to	build	a	jail	.
 The 	 y 	 	've	since	 abandon 	 ed 	 	that	project	,	thank	 good 	 ness 	 	.
 An 	 other 	 	problem	:	 un 	 health 	 y 	 	food	 system 	 s 	 	and	 un 	 employ 	 ment 	 	.
 Work 	 ing 	 - 	 class 	 	and	poor	urban	 American 	 s 	 	are	not	 benefit 	 ing 	 	 economic 	 ally 	 	from	our	current	food	system	.
It	 re 	 lies 	 	too	much	on	 transport 	 ation 	 	,	chemical	 fertil 	 ization 	 	,	big	use	of	water	and	 al 	 so 	 	 refrige 	 ration 	 	.
Mega	 agricultur 	 al 	 	 operation 	 s 	 	often	are	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	 poison 	 ing 	 	our	 water 	 ways 	 	and	our	land	,	and	it	 produce 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 un 	 health 	 y 	 	product	that	 cost 	 s 	 	us	 billion 	 s 	 	in	 health 	 care 	 	and	lost	 product 	 ivity 	 	.
And	so	we	know	``	urban	ag	''	is	a	big	buzz	 top 	 ic 	 	 th 	 is 	 	time	of	the	year	,	but	it	's	 most 	 ly 	 	 garden 	 ing 	 	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	some	value	in	community	building	--	 lot 	 s 	 	of	it	--	but	it	's	not	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	creating	 job 	 s 	 	or	for	food	production	.
The	 number 	 s 	 	just	are	n't	there	.
Part	of	my	work	now	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 lay 	 ing 	 	the	 ground 	 work 	 	to	integrate	urban	ag	and	 r 	 ural 	 	food	 system 	 s 	 	to	 ha 	 sten 	 	the	 de 	 mise 	 	of	the	3,000-mile	 s 	 al 	 ad 	 	by	creating	a	national	brand	of	 urban 	 - 	 grown 	 	produce	that	uses	 region 	 al 	 	growing	power	and	 augment 	 s 	 	it	with	 in 	 door 	 	growing	 facil 	 ities 	 	,	owned	and	 oper 	 ated 	 	by	small	 grow 	 ers 	 	,	where	now	there	are	 on 	 ly 	 	 consumer 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	can	support	 season 	 al 	 	 farm 	 ers 	 	around	metro	 area 	 s 	 	who	are	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	out	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 re 	 ally 	 	ca	n't	meet	the	 year 	 - 	 round 	 	demand	for	produce	.
It	's	not	a	 com 	 petition 	 	with	 r 	 ural 	 	farm	;	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 reinforce 	 ments 	 	.
It	 al 	 lies 	 	in	a	 re 	 ally 	 	positive	and	 economic 	 ally 	 	 vi 	 able 	 	food	system	.
The	goal	is	to	meet	the	cities	'	 institution 	 al 	 	 demand 	 s 	 	for	 hospital 	 s 	 	,	senior	 center 	 s 	 	,	 school 	 s 	 	,	 day 	 care 	 	 center 	 s 	 	,	and	produce	a	network	of	 region 	 al 	 	 job 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	smart	 infra 	 structure 	 	.
And	how	we	manage	our	built	environment	 affect 	 s 	 	the	health	and	 well 	 - 	 be 	 ing 	 	of	people	every	single	day	.
Our	 municipal 	 ities 	 	,	 r 	 ural 	 	and	urban	,	play	the	 operation 	 al 	 	course	of	 infra 	 structure 	 	--	 thing 	 s 	 	like	waste	 dispos 	 al 	 	,	energy	demand	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	social	 cost 	 s 	 	of	 un 	 employ 	 ment 	 	,	 drop 	 - 	 out 	 	rates	,	 incarce 	 ration 	 	rates	and	the	 impact 	 s 	 	of	 vari 	 ous 	 	public	health	 cost 	 s 	 	.
Smart	 infra 	 structure 	 	can	provide	 cost 	 - 	 saving 	 	ways	for	 municipal 	 ities 	 	to	handle	both	 infra 	 structure 	 	and	social	 need 	 s 	 	.
And	we	want	to	shift	the	 system 	 s 	 	that	open	the	 door 	 s 	 	for	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	 form 	 er 	 ly 	 	tax	 burden 	 s 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	part	of	the	tax	base	.
And	imagine	a	national	business	model	that	 create 	 s 	 	local	 job 	 s 	 	and	smart	 infra 	 structure 	 	to	improve	local	economic	 st 	 ability 	 	.
So	I	'm	 hop 	 ing 	 	you	can	see	a	little	theme	here	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	 indic 	 ate 	 	a	trend	.
I	have	n't	 create 	 d 	 	it	,	and	it	's	not	 happen 	 ing 	 	by	accident	.
I	'm	 not 	 ic 	 ing 	 	that	it	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	all	over	the	country	,	and	the	good	news	is	that	it	's	growing	.
And	we	all	need	to	be	 invest 	 ed 	 	in	it	.
It	is	an	essential	pillar	to	 th 	 is 	 	country	's	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	.
And	I	call	it	``	 home 	 town 	 	security	.	''
The	 recess 	 ion 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	us	 reel 	 ing 	 	and	 fear 	 ful 	 	,	and	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	in	the	air	these	 day 	 s 	 	that	is	 al 	 so 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 empower 	 ing 	 	.
It	's	a	 real 	 ization 	 	that	we	are	the	key	to	our	own	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	is	the	time	for	us	to	act	in	our	own	 commun 	 ities 	 	where	we	think	local	and	we	act	local	.
And	when	we	do	that	,	our	 neighbor 	 s 	 	--	be	they	 next 	 - 	 door 	 	,	or	in	the	next	state	,	or	in	the	next	country	--	will	be	just	fine	.
The	sum	of	the	local	is	the	global	.
 Home 	 town 	 	security	 mean 	 s 	 	 re 	 building 	 	our	natural	 defense 	 s 	 	,	 put 	 ting 	 	people	to	work	,	 re 	 storing 	 	our	natural	 system 	 s 	 	.
 Home 	 town 	 	security	 mean 	 s 	 	creating	wealth	here	at	home	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 destroy 	 ing 	 	it	 over 	 sea 	 s 	 	.
 Tackl 	 ing 	 	social	and	 environment 	 al 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	at	the	same	time	with	the	same	solution	 yield 	 s 	 	great	cost	 saving 	 s 	 	,	wealth	generation	and	national	security	.
 Man 	 y 	 	great	and	inspiring	 solution 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	generated	 a 	 cross 	 	America	.
The	 challeng 	 e 	 	for	us	now	is	to	identify	and	support	 count 	 less 	 	more	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	 home 	 town 	 	security	is	about	taking	care	of	your	own	,	but	it	's	not	like	the	old	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	 char 	 ity 	 	 begin 	 s 	 	at	home	.	''
I	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	read	a	book	 call 	 ed 	 	``	Love	 Lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	''	by	John	 Hop 	 e 	 	 Bryan 	 t 	 	.
And	it	's	about	 lead 	 ing 	 	in	a	world	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 do 	 es 	 	seem	to	be	 oper 	 ating 	 	on	the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	fear	.
And	 read 	 ing 	 	that	book	made	me	 re 	 examine 	 	that	 theor 	 y 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	I	need	to	explain	what	I	mean	by	that	.
See	,	my	dad	was	a	great	,	great	man	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	.
He	grew	up	in	the	 s 	 egreg 	 ated 	 	South	,	 es 	 cap 	 ed 	 	 ly 	 nch 	 ing 	 	and	all	that	 dur 	 ing 	 	some	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	 time 	 s 	 	,	and	he	 provide 	 d 	 	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 table 	 	home	for	me	and	my	 s 	 i 	 bling 	 s 	 	and	a	whole	bunch	of	other	people	that	fell	on	hard	 time 	 s 	 	.
But	,	like	all	of	us	,	he	had	some	 problem 	 s 	 	.
And	his	was	 gam 	 bling 	 	,	 compulsive 	 ly 	 	.
To	him	that	phrase	,	``	 Char 	 ity 	 	 begin 	 s 	 	at	home	,	''	 me 	 ant 	 	that	my	 pay 	 day 	 	--	or	 some 	 one 	 	else	's	--	would	just	happen	to	coincide	with	his	 luck 	 y 	 	day	.
So	you	need	to	help	him	out	.
And	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	I	would	loan	him	money	from	my	 after 	 - 	 school 	 	or	summer	 job 	 s 	 	,	and	he	 al 	 ways 	 	had	the	great	 intent 	 ion 	 	of	 pay 	 ing 	 	me	back	with	interest	,	of	course	,	after	he	hit	it	big	.
And	he	did	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	 believ 	 e 	 	it	or	not	,	at	a	 race 	 track 	 	in	 Lo 	 s 	 	 Angel 	 es 	 	--	one	reason	to	love	 L. 	 A. 	 	--	back	in	the	1940s	.
He	made	15,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	cash	and	 b 	 ought 	 	the	house	that	I	grew	up	in	.
So	I	'm	not	that	 un 	 happy 	 	about	that	.
But	listen	,	I	did	feel	 oblig 	 ated 	 	to	him	,	and	I	grew	up	--	then	I	grew	up	.
And	I	'm	a	grown	woman	now	,	and	I	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	a	few	 thing 	 s 	 	 a 	 long 	 	the	way	.
To	me	,	 char 	 ity 	 	often	is	just	about	giving	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	're	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	,	or	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	what	you	've	 al 	 ways 	 	 d 	 one 	 	,	or	it	's	about	giving	 un 	 til 	 	it	 hurt 	 s 	 	.
I	'm	about	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	the	 mean 	 s 	 	to	build	 some 	 thing 	 	that	will	grow	and	 intens 	 ify 	 	 it 	 s 	 	original	 invest 	 ment 	 	and	not	just	 requir 	 e 	 	 great 	 er 	 	giving	next	year	--	I	'm	not	 try 	 ing 	 	to	feed	the	habit	.
I	 s 	 pent 	 	some	 year 	 s 	 	 watch 	 ing 	 	how	good	 intent 	 ions 	 	for	community	 empower 	 ment 	 	,	that	 we 	 re 	 	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	there	to	support	the	community	and	empower	it	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	left	people	in	the	same	,	if	not	 wo 	 rse 	 	,	position	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	in	before	.
And	over	the	past	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	've	 s 	 pent 	 	record	 amount 	 s 	 	of	 philanthro 	 pic 	 	 dollar 	 s 	 	on	social	 problem 	 s 	 	,	yet	 education 	 al 	 	 out 	 come 	 s 	 	,	 mal 	 nutrition 	 	,	 incarce 	 ration 	 	,	 obes 	 ity 	 	,	diabetes	,	income	 dis 	 par 	 ity 	 	,	they	've	all	gone	up	with	some	 exception 	 s 	 	--	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	infant	 mortal 	 ity 	 	among	people	in	poverty	--	but	it	's	a	great	world	that	we	're	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	them	 in 	 to 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
And	I	know	a	little	bit	about	these	 issue 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	for	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	,	I	 s 	 pent 	 	a	long	time	in	the	 non 	 - 	 profit 	 	industrial	complex	,	and	I	'm	a	 re 	 cover 	 ing 	 	 ex 	 ecutive 	 	director	,	two	 year 	 s 	 	clean	.
But	 dur 	 ing 	 	that	time	,	I	 real 	 ized 	 	that	it	was	about	 project 	 s 	 	and	 develop 	 ing 	 	them	on	the	local	level	that	 re 	 ally 	 	was	going	to	do	the	right	thing	for	our	 commun 	 ities 	 	.
But	I	 re 	 ally 	 	did	struggle	for	financial	support	.
The	 great 	 er 	 	our	success	,	the	less	money	came	in	from	 found 	 ations 	 	.
And	I	tell	you	,	 be 	 ing 	 	on	the	TED	stage	and	winning	a	 Mac 	 Arthur 	 	in	the	same	exact	year	 g 	 ave 	 	 every 	 one 	 	the	impression	that	I	had	 arriv 	 ed 	 	.
And	by	the	time	I	'd	 move 	 d 	 	on	,	I	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 cover 	 ing 	 	a	third	of	my	 age 	 ncy 	 	's	budget	 defici 	 t 	 	with	 s 	 peaking 	 	 fee 	 s 	 	.
And	I	think	 be 	 cause 	 	early	on	,	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	my	 program 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	just	a	little	bit	 a 	 head 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	time	.
But	since	then	,	the	park	that	was	just	a	dump	and	was	 feature 	 d 	 	at	a	 TED 	 200 	 6 	 	Talk	 be 	 came 	 	 th 	 is 	 	little	thing	.
But	I	did	in	fact	get	married	in	it	.
Over	here	.
There	 go 	 es 	 	my	dog	who	led	me	to	the	park	in	my	 wed 	 d 	 ing 	 	.
The	South	Bronx	 Green 	 way 	 	was	 al 	 so 	 	just	a	 draw 	 ing 	 	on	the	stage	back	in	2006	.
Since	then	,	we	got	about	50	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	in	 stimul 	 us 	 	package	money	to	come	and	get	here	.
And	we	love	 th 	 is 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	I	love	construction	now	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	 watch 	 ing 	 	these	 thing 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	happen	.
So	I	want	 every 	 one 	 	to	understand	the	critical	 import 	 ance 	 	of	shifting	 char 	 ity 	 	 in 	 to 	 	enterprise	.
I	 start 	 ed 	 	my	firm	to	help	 commun 	 ities 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	country	 real 	 ize 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	potential	to	improve	 every 	 thing 	 	about	the	quality	of	life	for	 the 	 ir 	 	people	.
 Home 	 town 	 	security	is	next	on	my	 to 	 - 	 do 	 	list	.
What	we	need	are	people	who	see	the	value	in	 invest 	 ing 	 	in	these	 type 	 s 	 	of	local	 enterprise 	 s 	 	,	who	will	partner	with	 folk 	 s 	 	like	me	to	identify	the	growth	 trend 	 s 	 	and	climate	 adapt 	 ation 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	understand	the	growing	social	 cost 	 s 	 	of	business	 a 	 s 	 	usual	.
We	need	to	work	together	to	embrace	and	repair	our	land	,	repair	our	power	 system 	 s 	 	and	repair	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
It	's	time	to	stop	building	the	 shop 	 ping 	 	 mall 	 s 	 	,	the	 pri 	 son 	 s 	 	,	the	 stad 	 ium 	 s 	 	and	other	 tribute 	 s 	 	to	all	of	our	 collect 	 ive 	 	 failure 	 s 	 	.

Thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
 Mo 	 st 	 	people	do	n't	know	that	when	I	went	to	high	school	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	--	I	 appli 	 ed 	 	for	university	at	a	time	when	I	was	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	I	was	going	to	be	an	artist	and	be	a	 sculpt 	 or 	 	.
And	I	came	from	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 privilege 	 d 	 	 back 	 ground 	 	.	I	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 luck 	 y 	 	.
My	family	was	 wealth 	 y 	 	,	and	my	father	 believ 	 ed 	 	in	one	thing	,	and	that	was	to	give	us	all	 a 	 s 	 	much	education	 a 	 s 	 	we	 want 	 ed 	 	.
And	I	 announce 	 d 	 	I	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	a	 sculpt 	 or 	 	in	Paris	.
And	he	was	a	clever	man	.	He	sort	of	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Well	,	that	's	 O 	 K 	 	,	but	you	've	 d 	 one 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	well	in	your	math	SATs	.	''
In	fact	,	I	'd	got	an	800	.	And	he	thought	I	did	 ver 	 y 	 	well	--	and	I	did	,	too	--	in	the	 art 	 s 	 	:	 th 	 is 	 	was	my	 pass 	 ion 	 	.
And	he	 s 	 aid 	 	``	If	you	go	to	 MI 	 T 	 	,	''	to	which	I	had	 be 	 en 	 	 give 	 n 	 	early	 ad 	 mission 	 	,	``	I	will	pay	for	every	year	you	're	at	 MI 	 T 	 	,	in	graduate	or	 under 	 graduate 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	you	want	--	I	will	pay	for	an	equal	number	of	 year 	 s 	 	for	you	to	live	in	Paris	.	''
And	I	thought	that	was	the	best	deal	in	town	,	so	I	 accept 	 ed 	 	it	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	.
And	I	 decide 	 d 	 	that	if	I	was	good	in	art	,	and	I	was	good	in	 mathematic 	 s 	 	,	I	'd	 stud 	 y 	 	 architect 	 ure 	 	,	which	was	the	 blend 	 ing 	 	of	the	two	.
I	went	and	told	my	 head 	 master 	 	that	,	at	prep	school	.
And	I	 s 	 aid 	 	to	him	what	I	was	 do 	 ing 	 	,	that	I	was	going	to	go	 stud 	 y 	 	 architect 	 ure 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	art	and	 mathematic 	 s 	 	put	together	.
He	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	 some 	 thing 	 	that	just	went	 complete 	 ly 	 	over	my	head	.
He	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	You	know	,	I	like	 gr 	 ey 	 	 suit 	 s 	 	,	and	I	like	pin-striped	 suit 	 s 	 	,	but	I	do	n't	like	 gr 	 ey 	 	pin-striped	 suit 	 s 	 	.	''
And	I	thought	,	``	What	a	 tur 	 key 	 	 th 	 is 	 	guy	is	,	''	and	I	went	off	to	 MI 	 T 	 	.
I	 stud 	 ied 	 	 architect 	 ure 	 	,	then	did	a	second	degree	in	 architect 	 ure 	 	,	and	then	 actual 	 ly 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	 real 	 ized 	 	that	it	was	n't	 architect 	 ure 	 	.
That	 re 	 ally 	 	,	the	 mix 	 ing 	 	of	art	and	science	was	 computer 	 s 	 	,	and	that	that	 re 	 ally 	 	was	the	place	to	 br 	 ing 	 	both	,	and	 enjoy 	 ed 	 	a	 care 	 er 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	that	.
And	 prob 	 ably 	 	,	if	I	 we 	 re 	 	to	fill	out	Jim	Citrin	's	scale	,	I	'd	put	100	percent	on	the	side	of	the	 equ 	 ation 	 	where	you	 s 	 pend 	 	time	making	it	possible	for	 other 	 s 	 	to	be	creative	.
And	after	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	for	a	long	time	,	and	the	 Med 	 ia 	 	Lab	 pass 	 ing 	 	the	 ba 	 ton 	 	on	,	I	thought	,	``	Well	,	 may 	 be 	 	it	's	time	for	me	to	do	a	project	.
 Some 	 thing 	 	that	would	be	 import 	 ant 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	would	take	advantage	of	all	of	these	privileges	that	one	had	.	''
And	in	the	case	of	the	 Med 	 ia 	 	Lab	,	 know 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	people	,	 know 	 ing 	 	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	either	 ex 	 ecutive 	 s 	 	or	 wealth 	 y 	 	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	not	 hav 	 ing 	 	,	in	my	own	case	,	a	 care 	 er 	 	to	worry	about	 any 	 more 	 	.
My	 care 	 er 	 	,	I	mean	,	I	'd	 d 	 one 	 	my	 care 	 er 	 	.
Did	n't	have	to	worry	about	 earn 	 ing 	 	money	.
Did	n't	have	to	worry	about	what	people	thought	about	me	.
And	I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Boy	,	let	's	 re 	 ally 	 	do	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 take 	 s 	 	advantage	of	all	these	 feature 	 s 	 	,	''	and	thought	that	if	we	could	address	education	,	by	 lever 	 aging 	 	the	children	,	and	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	to	the	world	the	access	of	the	 computer 	 s 	 	,	that	that	was	 re 	 ally 	 	the	thing	we	should	do	.
Never	 show 	 n 	 	 th 	 is 	 	picture	before	,	and	 prob 	 ably 	 	going	to	be	 su 	 ed 	 	for	it	.
It	's	taken	at	three	 o 	 ' 	 clock 	 	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	the	 per 	 mission 	 	of	the	company	.
It	's	about	two	 week 	 s 	 	old	.	There	they	are	,	 folk 	 s 	 	.
If	you	look	at	the	picture	,	you	'll	see	they	're	 stack 	 ed 	 	up	.
 T 	 hose 	 	are	 convey 	 or 	 	 belt 	 s 	 	that	go	around	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	 convey 	 or 	 	 belt 	 s 	 	with	the	thing	going	by	,	but	then	you	'll	see	the	 one 	 s 	 	up	above	.
What	 happen 	 s 	 	is	,	they	burn	 in 	 to 	 	flash	 memor 	 y 	 	the	 soft 	 ware 	 	,	and	then	test	them	for	a	few	 hour 	 s 	 	.
But	you	've	got	to	have	the	thing	moving	on	the	 assem 	 bly 	 	line	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	constant	.
So	they	go	around	in	 th 	 is 	 	loop	,	which	is	why	you	see	them	up	there	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	was	great	for	us	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	a	real	 turn 	 ing 	 	point	.	But	it	 go 	 es 	 	back	.
 Th 	 is 	 	picture	was	taken	in	1982	,	just	before	the	IBM	PC	was	even	 announce 	 d 	 	.
Seymour	 Pa 	 pert 	 	and	I	 we 	 re 	 	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	to	 school 	 s 	 	and	 develop 	 ing 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	at	a	time	when	it	was	way	 a 	 head 	 	of	 it 	 self 	 	.
But	one	thing	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	was	that	these	 kid 	 s 	 	can	 absolute 	 ly 	 	jump	 in 	 to 	 	it	just	the	same	way	 a 	 s 	 	our	 kid 	 s 	 	do	here	.
And	when	people	tell	me	,	``	Who	's	going	to	teach	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	to	teach	the	 kid 	 s 	 	?	''
I	say	to	 my 	 self 	 	,	``	What	planet	do	you	come	from	?	''
 Oka 	 y 	 	,	there	's	not	a	person	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	--	I	do	n't	care	how	 tech 	 ie 	 	you	are	--	there	's	not	a	person	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	give	 the 	 ir 	 	 lap 	 top 	 	or	cell	phone	to	a	kid	to	help	them	debug	it	.	 O 	 K 	 	?
We	all	need	help	,	even	 t 	 hose 	 	of	us	who	are	 ver 	 y 	 	seasoned	.
 Th 	 is 	 	picture	of	Seymour	--	25	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.	Seymour	made	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 observ 	 ation 	 	in	1968	,	and	then	 bas 	 ically 	 	 present 	 ed 	 	it	in	1970	--	April	11	to	be	precise	--	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 Teach 	 ing 	 	 Child 	 ren 	 	 Think 	 ing 	 	.	''
What	he	 observ 	 ed 	 	was	that	 kid 	 s 	 	who	write	computer	 program 	 s 	 	understand	 thing 	 s 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	,	and	when	they	debug	the	 program 	 s 	 	,	they	come	the	 close 	 st 	 	to	 learn 	 ing 	 	about	 learn 	 ing 	 	.
That	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	and	in	some	sense	,	we	've	lost	that	.
 Kid 	 s 	 	do	n't	program	 en 	 ough 	 	and	boy	,	if	there	's	 any 	 thing 	 	I	hope	 th 	 is 	 	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	back	,	it	's	 programm 	 ing 	 	to	 kid 	 s 	 	.
It	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.	 Us 	 ing 	 	 application 	 s 	 	is	 O 	 K 	 	,	but	 programm 	 ing 	 	is	 absolute 	 ly 	 	fundamental	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 launch 	 ed 	 	with	three	 language 	 s 	 	in	it	:	Squeak	,	 Lo 	 go 	 	,	and	a	third	,	that	I	've	never	even	 s 	 een 	 	before	.
The	point	 be 	 ing 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	intensive	on	the	 programm 	 ing 	 	side	.
 Th 	 is 	 	photograph	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	much	 lat 	 er 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	in	the	early	2000s	.	My	son	,	 Dimi 	 tri 	 	--	who	's	here	,	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	know	 Dimi 	 tri 	 	--	went	to	Cambodia	,	set	up	 th 	 is 	 	school	that	we	had	built	,	just	 a 	 s 	 	the	school	 connect 	 ed 	 	it	to	the	Internet	.
And	these	 kid 	 s 	 	had	 the 	 ir 	 	 lap 	 top 	 s 	 	.	But	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	what	 spirit 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	plus	the	influence	of	 Jo 	 e 	 	and	 other 	 s 	 	.	We	 start 	 ed 	 	One	 Lap 	 top 	 	per	Child	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	same	village	in	Cambodia	,	just	a	couple	of	 month 	 s 	 	ago	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	are	real	 pro 	 s 	 	.	There	 we 	 re 	 	just	7,000	 machine 	 s 	 	out	there	 be 	 ing 	 	tested	by	 kid 	 s 	 	.	 Be 	 ing 	 	a	 non 	 profit 	 	is	 absolute 	 ly 	 	fundamental	.
 Every 	 body 	 	 advise 	 d 	 	me	not	to	be	a	 non 	 profit 	 	,	but	they	 we 	 re 	 	all	wrong	.
And	the	reason	 be 	 ing 	 	a	 non 	 profit 	 	is	 import 	 ant 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	twofold	.
There	are	 man 	 y 	 	 reason 	 s 	 	,	but	the	two	that	merit	the	little	bit	of	time	is	:	one	,	the	 clar 	 ity 	 	of	purpose	is	there	.	The	moral	purpose	is	clear	.
I	can	see	any	head	of	state	,	any	 ex 	 ecutive 	 	I	want	,	at	any	time	,	 be 	 cause 	 	I	'm	not	selling	 lap 	 top 	 s 	 	.	 O 	 K 	 	?	I	have	no	 share 	 holder 	 s 	 	.
 W 	 he 	 ther 	 	we	sell	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	any	 differ 	 ence 	 	 what 	 so 	 ever 	 	.
The	 clar 	 ity 	 	of	purpose	is	 absolute 	 ly 	 	critical	.	And	the	second	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 counter 	 intuitive 	 	--	you	can	get	the	best	people	in	the	world	.
If	you	look	at	our	professional	 service 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	search	 firm 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 communication 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	legal	 service 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 bank 	 ing 	 	,	they	're	all	pro	bono	.	And	it	's	not	to	 s 	 ave 	 	money	.
We	've	got	money	in	the	bank	.	It	's	 be 	 cause 	 	you	get	the	best	people	.
You	get	the	people	who	are	 do 	 ing 	 	it	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 believ 	 e 	 	in	the	mission	,	and	they	're	the	best	people	.
We	could	n't	afford	to	hire	a	 C 	 FO 	 	.	We	put	out	a	job	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	for	a	 C 	 FO 	 	at	zero	 s 	 al 	 ary 	 	,	and	we	had	a	queue	of	people	.
It	 allow 	 s 	 	you	to	team	up	with	people	.	The	 U. 	 N. 	 	's	not	going	to	be	our	partner	if	we	're	profit	making	.	So	 announc 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	with	 K 	 ofi 	 	 Ann 	 an 	 	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	and	the	 U. 	 N. 	 	 allow 	 ed 	 	us	to	 bas 	 ically 	 	reach	all	the	 count 	 ries 	 	.	And	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	machine	we	 we 	 re 	 	 show 	 ing 	 	before	I	met	 Y 	 ves 	 	 Be 	 har 	 	.
And	while	 th 	 is 	 	machine	in	some	sense	is	 s 	 il 	 ly 	 	,	in	retrospect	,	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 serv 	 ed 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	purpose	.
That	pencil-yellow	crank	was	 remember 	 ed 	 	by	 every 	 body 	 	.
 Every 	 body 	 	 remember 	 ed 	 	the	pencil-yellow	crank	.	It	's	different	.
It	was	 get 	 ting 	 	 it 	 s 	 	power	in	a	different	way	.	It	's	kind	of	 child 	 like 	 	.
Even	 th 	 ough 	 	 th 	 is 	 	was	n't	the	direction	we	went	 be 	 cause 	 	the	crank	--	it	 re 	 ally 	 	is	stupid	to	have	it	on	board	,	by	the	way	.
In	spite	of	what	some	people	in	the	press	do	n't	get	it	,	did	n't	understand	it	,	we	did	n't	take	it	off	 be 	 cause 	 	we	did	n't	want	to	do	--	 hav 	 ing 	 	it	on	the	 lap 	 top 	 	 it 	 self 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	not	what	you	want	.
You	want	a	 separat 	 e 	 	thing	,	like	the	AC	adaptor	.
I	did	n't	 br 	 ing 	 	one	with	me	,	but	they	 re 	 ally 	 	work	much	better	off-board	.
And	then	,	I	could	tell	you	 lot 	 s 	 	about	the	 lap 	 top 	 	,	but	I	 decide 	 d 	 	on	just	four	 thing 	 s 	 	.
Just	keep	in	mind	--	 be 	 cause 	 	there	are	other	people	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	Bill	 Gate 	 s 	 	,	who	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Gee	,	you	've	got	a	real	computer	.	''
That	computer	is	 un 	 like 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	you	've	had	,	and	 do 	 es 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	--	there	are	four	of	them	--	that	you	do	n't	come	close	to	.	And	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	be	low	power	,	and	I	hope	that	's	 pick 	 ed 	 	up	more	by	the	industry	.
That	the	reason	that	you	want	to	be	 be 	 low 	 	two	 watt 	 s 	 	is	that	's	 rough 	 ly 	 	what	you	can	generate	with	your	upper	body	.
Dual-mode	 dis 	 play 	 	--	that	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	 dis 	 play 	 	's	fantastic	.
We	 we 	 re 	 	using	it	at	lunch	 to 	 day 	 	in	the	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	,	and	the	more	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	the	better	.
And	that	was	 re 	 ally 	 	critical	.	The	mesh	network	,	it	'll	 be 	 come 	 	 common 	 place 	 	.
And	of	course	,	``	 rug 	 ged 	 	''	 go 	 es 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	.
And	the	reason	I	think	design	 matter 	 s 	 	is	n't	 be 	 cause 	 	I	 want 	 ed 	 	to	go	to	art	school	.
And	by	the	way	,	when	I	 graduate 	 d 	 	from	 MI 	 T 	 	,	I	thought	the	worst	and	silliest	thing	to	do	would	be	to	go	to	Paris	for	six	 year 	 s 	 	.
So	,	I	did	n't	do	that	.	But	design	 matter 	 s 	 	for	a	number	of	 reason 	 s 	 	.
The	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	that	it	is	the	best	way	to	make	an	 in 	 expensive 	 	product	.
 Mo 	 st 	 	people	make	 in 	 expensive 	 	 product 	 s 	 	by	taking	cheap	design	,	cheap	labor	,	cheap	 component 	 s 	 	,	and	making	a	cheap	 lap 	 top 	 	.
And	,	in	English	,	the	word	``	cheap	''	 ha 	 s 	 	a	double	meaning	,	which	is	 re 	 ally 	 	appropriate	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	cheap	,	in	the	 pe 	 jo 	 rative 	 	sense	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	 in 	 expensive 	 	.
But	if	you	take	a	different	approach	,	and	you	think	of	 ver 	 y 	 	 large 	 - 	 scale 	 	 integ 	 ration 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 advance 	 d 	 	 material 	 s 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 advance 	 d 	 	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	--	so	you	're	 pour 	 ing 	 	 chemical 	 s 	 	in	one	end	,	 iPod 	 s 	 	are	 spew 	 ing 	 	out	the	other	--	and	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	design	,	that	's	what	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	.
And	I	can	race	through	these	and	 s 	 ave 	 	a	lot	of	time	 be 	 cause 	 	 Y 	 ves 	 	and	I	 obvious 	 ly 	 	did	n't	 compar 	 e 	 	 note 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	his	 slide 	 s 	 	,	and	so	I	do	n't	have	to	talk	about	them	.
But	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	,	to	us	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	.
It	was	n't	just	to	kind	of	make	it	cute	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 some 	 body 	 	--	you	know	,	good	design	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
 Y 	 ves 	 	 show 	 ed 	 	one	of	the	 power 	 - 	 generating 	 	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	.
The	mesh	network	,	the	reason	I	--	and	I	wo	n't	go	 in 	 to 	 	it	in	great	detail	--	but	when	we	deliver	 lap 	 top 	 s 	 	to	 kid 	 s 	 	in	the	 remote 	 st 	 	and	 poor 	 est 	 	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	world	,	they	're	 connect 	 ed 	 	.	There	's	not	just	 lap 	 top 	 s 	 	.
And	so	,	we	have	to	drop	in	satellite	 dish 	 es 	 	.	We	put	in	 gene 	 rator 	 s 	 	.
It	's	a	lot	of	stuff	that	 go 	 es 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	these	.	 Th 	 ese 	 	can	talk	to	each	other	.
If	you	're	in	a	desert	,	they	can	talk	to	each	other	about	two	 kilometer 	 s 	 	 a 	 part 	 	.
If	you	're	in	the	jungle	,	it	's	about	500	 meter 	 s 	 	.	So	if	a	kid	 bi 	 cycle 	 s 	 	home	,	or	 walk 	 s 	 	a	few	 mile 	 s 	 	,	they	're	going	to	be	off	the	grid	,	so	to	speak	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	not	going	to	be	near	 an 	 other 	 	 lap 	 top 	 	,	so	you	have	to	nail	these	onto	a	tree	,	and	sort	of	,	get	it	.
You	do	n't	call	 Ver 	 i 	 zon 	 	or	Sprint	.	You	build	your	own	network	.
And	that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	the	user	 inter 	 face 	 	.
We	are	 launch 	 ing 	 	with	18	 key 	 board 	 s 	 	.	English	is	by	far	the	 minor 	 ity 	 	.
 Lat 	 in 	 	is	 relat 	 ively 	 	rare	,	too	.	You	just	look	at	some	of	the	 language 	 s 	 	.
I	'm	 will 	 ing 	 	to	suspect	some	of	you	had	n't	even	heard	of	them	before	.
 I 	 s 	 	there	 any 	 body 	 	in	the	room	,	one	person	,	 un 	 less 	 	you	work	with	 OL 	 PC 	 	,	is	there	 any 	 body 	 	in	the	room	that	can	tell	me	what	language	the	 key 	 board 	 	is	that	's	on	the	screen	?	There	's	 on 	 ly 	 	one	hand	--	so	you	get	it	.
Yes	,	you	're	right	.	He	's	right	.	It	's	Amharic	,	it	's	 Ethiopia 	 n 	 	.	In	Ethiopia	,	there	's	never	 be 	 en 	 	a	 key 	 board 	 	.
There	is	no	 key 	 board 	 	standard	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	no	market	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	big	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
 Aga 	 in 	 	,	when	you	're	a	 non 	 profit 	 	,	you	look	at	children	 a 	 s 	 	a	mission	,	not	 a 	 s 	 	a	market	.
So	we	went	to	Ethiopia	,	and	we	 help 	 ed 	 	them	make	a	 key 	 board 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	will	 be 	 come 	 	the	standard	 Ethiopia 	 n 	 	 key 	 board 	 	.
So	what	I	want	to	end	with	is	sort	of	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	to	roll	it	out	.
And	we	 change 	 d 	 	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	.	I	 decide 	 d 	 	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	--	it	was	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	thing	to	decide	in	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	it	's	not	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	now	--	is	to	go	to	six	 count 	 ries 	 	.
Big	 count 	 ries 	 	,	one	of	them	is	not	so	big	,	but	it	's	rich	.
 He 	 re 	 	's	the	six	.	We	went	to	the	six	,	and	in	each	case	the	head	of	state	 s 	 aid 	 	he	would	do	it	,	he	'd	do	a	million	.
In	the	case	of	Qaddafi	,	he	'd	do	1.2	million	,	and	that	they	would	launch	it	.
We	thought	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	right	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	,	get	it	out	,	and	then	the	little	 count 	 ries 	 	could	sort	of	 piggy 	 back 	 	on	these	big	 count 	 ries 	 	.
And	so	I	went	to	each	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	at	 l 	 east 	 	six	 time 	 s 	 	,	met	with	the	head	of	state	 prob 	 ably 	 	two	or	three	 time 	 s 	 	.
In	each	case	,	got	the	 mini 	 sters 	 	,	went	through	a	lot	of	the	stuff	.
 Th 	 is 	 	was	a	period	in	my	life	where	I	was	 travel 	 ing 	 	330	 day 	 s 	 	per	year	.
Not	 some 	 thing 	 	you	'd	 en 	 vy 	 	or	want	to	do	.
In	the	case	of	Libya	,	it	was	a	lot	of	 f 	 un 	 	 meet 	 ing 	 	Qaddafi	in	his	tent	.
The	camel	 smell 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 un 	 believ 	 able 	 	.
And	it	was	45	 degree 	 s 	 	C.	I	mean	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	not	what	you	'd	call	a	cool	experience	.	And	 form 	 er 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	--	I	say	 form 	 er 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 non 	 e 	 	of	them	 re 	 ally 	 	came	through	 th 	 is 	 	summer	--	there	was	a	big	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	 get 	 ting 	 	a	head	of	state	to	have	a	photo	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	,	make	a	press	 re 	 lease 	 	.
So	we	went	to	 small 	 er 	 	 one 	 s 	 	.	 Ur 	 ug 	 uay 	 	,	bless	 the 	 ir 	 	 heart 	 s 	 	.
Small	country	,	not	so	rich	.	 P 	 resident 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	he	'd	do	it	,	and	guess	what	?
He	did	do	it	.	The	tender	had	 noth 	 ing 	 	in	it	that	related	to	us	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	specific	about	sunlight-readable	,	 mesh 	 - 	 network 	 	,	low-power	,	but	just	a	 van 	 illa 	 	 lap 	 top 	 	proposal	.
And	guess	what	?	We	won	it	 hand 	 s 	 	down	.
When	it	was	 announce 	 d 	 	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	do	every	child	in	 Ur 	 ug 	 uay 	 	,	the	first	100,000	,	boom	,	went	to	 OL 	 PC 	 	.
The	next	day	--	the	next	day	,	not	even	24	 hour 	 s 	 	had	 pass 	 ed 	 	--	in	 Per 	 u 	 	,	the	 p 	 resident 	 	of	 Per 	 u 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	We	'll	do	250	.	''	And	boom	,	a	little	 domin 	 o 	 	effect	.
The	 p 	 resident 	 	of	Rwanda	 steppe 	 d 	 	in	and	 s 	 aid 	 	he	would	do	it	.
The	 p 	 resident 	 	of	Ethiopia	 s 	 aid 	 	he	would	do	it	.
And	boom	,	boom	,	boom	.	The	 p 	 resident 	 	of	 Mon 	 golia 	 	.
And	so	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	,	these	 thing 	 s 	 	start	to	happen	with	these	 count 	 ries 	 	--	still	not	 en 	 ough 	 	.
Add	up	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	,	it	did	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	get	to	thing	,	so	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Let	's	start	a	program	in	the	 Unit 	 ed 	 	 Stat 	 es 	 	.	''	So	,	end	of	 Au 	 gust 	 	,	early	September	,	we	decide	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.	We	 announce 	 d 	 	it	near	the	middle	,	end	--	just	when	the	Clinton	 In 	 iti 	 ative 	 	was	taking	place	.
We	thought	that	was	a	good	time	to	announce	it	.
Launched	it	on	the	12	of	 Nove 	 mb 	 er 	 	.
We	 s 	 aid 	 	it	would	be	just	for	a	short	period	 un 	 til 	 	the	26	.	We	've	 extend 	 ed 	 	it	 un 	 til 	 	the	31	.
And	the	``	 G 	 ive 	 	One	,	Get	One	''	program	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	got	a	lot	of	people	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	.
The	first	day	it	was	just	wild	.	And	then	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Well	,	let	's	get	people	to	give	 man 	 y 	 	.	Not	just	one	,	and	get	one	,	but	 may 	 be 	 	give	100	,	give	1,000	.	''	And	that	's	where	you	come	in	.
And	that	's	where	I	think	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.	I	do	n't	want	you	all	to	go	out	and	buy	400	 dollar 	 s 	 	worth	of	 lap 	 top 	 s 	 	.	 Oka 	 y 	 	?	Do	it	,	but	that	's	not	going	to	help	.	 Oka 	 y 	 	?
If	 every 	 body 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	 go 	 es 	 	out	 to 	 night 	 	and	 order 	 s 	 	one	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	for	400	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	,	300	people	in	the	room	 do 	 ing 	 	it	--	 yea 	 h 	 	,	great	.
I	want	you	do	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
And	it	's	not	to	go	out	and	buy	100	or	1,000	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	I	 invit 	 e 	 	you	to	do	that	,	and	10,000	would	be	even	better	.
Tell	people	about	it	!	It	's	got	to	 be 	 come 	 	viral	,	 O 	 K 	 	?
Use	your	 mail 	 ing 	 	 list 	 s 	 	.	People	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	have	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 mail 	 ing 	 	 list 	 s 	 	.
Get	your	 friend 	 s 	 	to	give	one	,	get	one	.
And	if	each	one	of	you	 s 	 end 	 s 	 	it	to	300	or	400	people	,	that	would	be	fantastic	.
I	wo	n't	 d 	 well 	 	on	the	 pric 	 ing 	 	at	all	.
Just	to	say	that	when	you	do	the	``	 G 	 ive 	 	One	,	Get	One	,	''	a	lot	of	press	is	a	bit	about	,	``	 The 	 y 	 	did	n't	make	it	,	it	's	188	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	it	's	not	100	.	''
It	will	be	100	in	two	 year 	 s 	 	.	It	will	go	 be 	 low 	 	100	.
We	've	 pledg 	 ed 	 	not	to	add	 feature 	 s 	 	,	but	to	 br 	 ing 	 	that	price	down	.
But	it	was	the	 count 	 ries 	 	that	 want 	 ed 	 	it	to	go	up	,	and	we	let	them	push	it	up	for	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 reason 	 s 	 	.	So	what	you	can	do	--	I	've	just	 s 	 aid 	 	it	.	Do	n't	just	give	one	,	get	one	.
I	just	want	to	end	with	one	last	one	.	 Th 	 is 	 	one	is	not	even	24-hours	old	,	or	 may 	 be 	 	it	's	24-hours	.
The	first	 kid 	 s 	 	got	 the 	 ir 	 	 lap 	 top 	 s 	 	.	 The 	 y 	 	got	them	by	ship	,	and	I	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	now	about	7,000	,	8,000	at	a	time	went	out	 th 	 is 	 	week	.
 The 	 y 	 	went	to	 Ur 	 ug 	 uay 	 	,	 Per 	 u 	 	,	Mexico	.
And	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 low 	 	coming	,	and	we	're	 on 	 ly 	 	making	about	5,000	a	week	,	but	we	hope	,	we	hope	,	 some 	 time 	 	in	next	year	,	 may 	 be 	 	by	the	middle	of	the	year	,	to	hit	a	million	a	month	.	 N 	 ow 	 	put	that	number	,	and	a	million	is	n't	so	much	.	It	's	not	a	big	number	.
We	're	selling	a	billion	cell	 phone 	 s 	 	 world 	 wide 	 	 th 	 is 	 	year	.
But	a	million	a	month	in	laptop-land	is	a	big	number	.
And	the	world	production	 to 	 day 	 	,	 every 	 body 	 	 combine 	 d 	 	,	making	 lap 	 top 	 s 	 	,	is	five	million	a	month	.	So	I	'm	 stand 	 ing 	 	here	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	that	 some 	 time 	 	next	year	,	we	're	going	to	make	20	percent	of	the	world	production	.
And	if	we	do	that	,	there	are	going	to	be	a	lot	of	 luck 	 y 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	out	there	.
And	we	hope	if	you	have	EG	two	 year 	 s 	 	from	now	,	or	 when 	 ever 	 	you	have	it	 aga 	 in 	 	,	I	wo	n't	have	bad	breath	,	and	I	will	be	 invit 	 ed 	 	back	,	and	will	have	,	 hope 	 fully 	 	by	then	,	 may 	 be 	 	100	million	out	there	to	children	.
Thank	you	.
I	,	like	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	,	am	one	of	the	two	billion	people	on	Earth	who	live	in	cities	.
And	there	are	 day 	 s 	 	--	I	do	n't	know	about	the	rest	of	you	 guy 	 s 	 	--	but	there	are	 day 	 s 	 	when	I	 palp 	 ably 	 	feel	how	much	I	 re 	 ly 	 	on	other	people	for	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 every 	 thing 	 	in	my	life	.
And	some	 day 	 s 	 	,	that	can	even	be	a	little	 scar 	 y 	 	.
But	what	I	'm	here	to	talk	to	you	about	 to 	 day 	 	is	how	that	same	 inter 	 depend 	 ence 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	an	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	social	 infra 	 structure 	 	that	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	harness	to	help	heal	some	of	our	 deep 	 est 	 	civic	 issue 	 s 	 	,	if	we	 app 	 ly 	 	open	source	 collabor 	 ation 	 	.
A	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	I	read	an	article	by	New	York	 Time 	 s 	 	writer	Michael	 Poll 	 an 	 	in	which	he	 argu 	 ed 	 	that	growing	even	some	of	our	own	food	is	one	of	the	best	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	can	do	for	the	environment	.
 N 	 ow 	 	at	the	time	that	I	was	 read 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	it	was	the	middle	of	the	winter	and	I	 definite 	 ly 	 	did	not	have	room	for	a	lot	of	dirt	in	my	New	York	City	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	.
So	I	was	 bas 	 ically 	 	just	 will 	 ing 	 	to	settle	for	just	 read 	 ing 	 	the	next	 Wire 	 d 	 	magazine	and	 find 	 ing 	 	out	how	the	 expert 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	figure	out	how	to	solve	all	these	 problem 	 s 	 	for	us	in	the	future	.
But	that	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	point	that	Michael	 Poll 	 an 	 	was	making	in	 th 	 is 	 	article	--	was	it	's	 precise 	 ly 	 	when	we	hand	over	the	 respons 	 ibility 	 	for	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	to	 special 	 ists 	 	that	we	cause	the	kind	of	 mess 	 es 	 	that	we	see	with	the	food	system	.
So	,	I	happen	to	know	a	little	bit	from	my	own	work	about	how	 NAS 	 A 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	using	 hydroponic 	 s 	 	to	explore	growing	food	in	space	.
And	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	get	optimal	 nutrition 	 al 	 	yield	by	running	a	kind	of	 high 	 - 	 quality 	 	liquid	 s 	 oil 	 	over	 plant 	 s 	 	'	root	 system 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	to	a	 veget 	 able 	 	plant	,	my	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	got	to	be	about	 a 	 s 	 	foreign	 a 	 s 	 	 out 	 er 	 	space	.
But	I	can	 off 	 er 	 	some	natural	light	and	 year 	 - 	 round 	 	climate	control	.
 Fast 	 - 	 forward 	 	two	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	:	we	now	have	window	 farm 	 s 	 	,	which	are	 vert 	 ical 	 	,	hydroponic	 platform 	 s 	 	for	 food 	 - 	 growing 	 	 in 	 door 	 s 	 	.
And	the	way	it	 work 	 s 	 	is	that	there	's	a	pump	at	the	bottom	,	which	 period 	 ically 	 	 s 	 end 	 s 	 	some	of	 th 	 is 	 	liquid	nutrient	solution	up	to	the	top	,	which	then	 trick 	 les 	 	down	through	 plant 	 s 	 	'	root	 system 	 s 	 	that	are	 suspend 	 ed 	 	in	clay	 pel 	 lets 	 	--	so	there	's	no	dirt	 involve 	 d 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	light	and	temperature	vary	with	each	window	's	 micro 	 climate 	 	,	so	a	window	farm	 requir 	 es 	 	a	 farm 	 er 	 	,	and	she	must	decide	what	kind	of	 crop 	 s 	 	she	is	going	to	put	in	her	window	farm	,	and	 whet 	 her 	 	she	is	going	to	feed	her	food	 organ 	 ically 	 	.
Back	at	the	time	,	a	window	farm	was	no	more	than	a	 technical 	 ly 	 	complex	idea	that	was	going	to	 requir 	 e 	 	a	lot	of	 test 	 ing 	 	.
And	I	 re 	 ally 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	it	to	be	an	open	project	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 hydroponic 	 s 	 	is	one	of	the	 fast 	 est 	 	growing	 area 	 s 	 	of	 patent 	 ing 	 	in	the	 Unit 	 ed 	 	 Stat 	 es 	 	right	now	and	could	possibly	 be 	 come 	 	 an 	 other 	 	area	like	 Mon 	 s 	 ant 	 o 	 	,	where	we	have	a	lot	of	corporate	intellectual	 proper 	 ty 	 	in	the	way	of	people	's	food	.
So	I	 decide 	 d 	 	that	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	creating	a	product	,	what	I	was	going	to	do	was	open	 th 	 is 	 	up	to	a	whole	bunch	of	 co 	 - 	 develop 	 ers 	 	.
The	first	few	 system 	 s 	 	that	we	 create 	 d 	 	,	they	kind	of	 work 	 ed 	 	.
We	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	able	to	grow	about	a	 s 	 al 	 ad 	 	a	week	in	a	typical	New	York	City	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	window	.
And	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	grow	 cher 	 ry 	 	 tomato 	 es 	 	and	 cucumber 	 s 	 	,	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	stuff	.
But	the	first	few	 system 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	these	 leak 	 y 	 	,	loud	 power 	 - 	 guzzl 	 ers 	 	that	 Mart 	 ha 	 	 Stew 	 art 	 	would	 definite 	 ly 	 	never	have	approved	.
So	to	 br 	 ing 	 	on	more	 co 	 - 	 develop 	 ers 	 	,	what	we	did	was	we	 create 	 d 	 	a	social	media	 s 	 ite 	 	on	which	we	 publish 	 ed 	 	the	 design 	 s 	 	,	we	 explain 	 ed 	 	how	they	 work 	 ed 	 	,	and	we	even	went	so	far	 a 	 s 	 	to	point	out	 every 	 thing 	 	that	was	wrong	with	these	 system 	 s 	 	.
And	then	we	 invit 	 ed 	 	people	all	over	the	world	to	build	them	and	experiment	with	us	.
So	 actual 	 ly 	 	now	on	 th 	 is 	 	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	,	we	have	18,000	people	.
And	we	have	window	 farm 	 s 	 	all	over	the	world	.
What	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	is	what	 NAS 	 A 	 	or	a	large	corporation	would	call	R	&	amp	;	D	,	or	research	and	 develop 	 ment 	 	.
But	what	we	call	it	is	R	&	amp	;	 D 	 - 	 I 	 - 	 Y 	 	,	or	research	and	develop	it	 your 	 self 	 	.
So	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 Jack 	 son 	 	came	 a 	 long 	 	and	 suggest 	 ed 	 	that	we	use	air	 pump 	 s 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	water	 pump 	 s 	 	.
It	took	building	a	whole	bunch	of	 system 	 s 	 	to	get	it	right	,	but	once	we	did	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	cut	our	carbon	 foot 	 print 	 	 near 	 ly 	 	in	half	.
 T 	 ony 	 	in	 Chi 	 cago 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	taking	on	growing	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	like	 lot 	 s 	 	of	other	window	 farm 	 ers 	 	,	and	he	's	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	get	his	 straw 	 berries 	 	to	fruit	for	nine	 month 	 s 	 	of	the	year	in	 low 	 - 	 light 	 	 condition 	 s 	 	by	 simpl 	 y 	 	changing	out	the	 organ 	 ic 	 	 nutrient 	 s 	 	.
And	window	 farm 	 ers 	 	in	 Fin 	 land 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 custom 	 izing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	window	 farm 	 s 	 	for	the	dark	 day 	 s 	 	of	the	 Finn 	 ish 	 	 winter 	 s 	 	by	 out 	 fitting 	 	them	with	LED	grow	 light 	 s 	 	that	they	're	now	making	open	source	and	part	of	the	project	.
So	window	 farm 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 evolv 	 ing 	 	through	a	rapid	 version 	 ing 	 	process	similar	to	 soft 	 ware 	 	.
And	with	every	open	source	project	,	the	real	benefit	is	the	 inter 	 play 	 	between	the	specific	 concern 	 s 	 	of	people	 custom 	 izing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 system 	 s 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 part 	 icular 	 	 concern 	 s 	 	and	the	universal	 concern 	 s 	 	.
So	my	core	team	and	I	are	able	to	 concent 	 rate 	 	on	the	 improve 	 ments 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	benefit	 every 	 one 	 	.
And	we	're	able	to	look	out	for	the	 need 	 s 	 	of	 new 	 com 	 ers 	 	.
So	for	 do 	 - 	 it 	 - 	 your 	 self 	 ers 	 	,	we	provide	free	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 well 	 - 	 tested 	 	 instruct 	 ions 	 	so	that	 any 	 one 	 	,	 any 	 where 	 	around	the	world	,	can	build	one	of	these	 system 	 s 	 	for	free	.
And	there	's	a	patent	 pend 	 ing 	 	on	these	 system 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	that	's	held	by	the	community	.
And	to	fund	the	project	,	we	partner	to	create	 product 	 s 	 	that	we	then	sell	to	 school 	 s 	 	and	to	 individual 	 s 	 	who	do	n't	have	time	to	build	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 system 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	 with 	 in 	 	our	community	,	a	certain	culture	 ha 	 s 	 	 appear 	 ed 	 	.
In	our	culture	,	it	is	better	to	be	a	 test 	 er 	 	who	 support 	 s 	 	 some 	 one 	 	else	's	idea	than	it	is	to	be	just	the	idea	guy	.
What	we	get	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	project	is	we	get	support	for	our	own	work	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	an	experience	of	 actual 	 ly 	 	 con 	 trib 	 uting 	 	to	the	 environment 	 al 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	in	a	way	other	than	just	 screw 	 ing 	 	in	new	light	 bulb 	 s 	 	.
But	I	think	that	Eileen	 express 	 es 	 	best	what	we	 re 	 ally 	 	get	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	which	is	the	actual	joy	of	 collabor 	 ation 	 	.
So	she	 express 	 es 	 	here	what	it	's	like	to	see	 some 	 one 	 	 half 	 way 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	world	 hav 	 ing 	 	taken	your	idea	,	built	 up 	 on 	 	it	and	then	 acknowledg 	 ing 	 	you	for	 con 	 trib 	 uting 	 	.
If	we	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	see	the	kind	of	wide	consumer	behavior	change	that	we	're	all	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 a 	 s 	 	 environment 	 alist 	 s 	 	and	food	people	,	 may 	 be 	 	we	just	need	to	 d 	 itch 	 	the	term	``	consumer	''	and	get	 be 	 hind 	 	the	people	who	are	 do 	 ing 	 	stuff	.
Open	source	 project 	 s 	 	tend	to	have	a	 moment 	 um 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	.
And	what	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	is	that	R	&	amp	;	 D 	 - 	 I 	 - 	 Y 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 move 	 d 	 	beyond	just	window	 farm 	 s 	 	and	 LED 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	solar	 pan 	 el 	 s 	 	and	aquaponic	 system 	 s 	 	.
And	we	're	building	 up 	 on 	 	 innov 	 ations 	 	of	 generation 	 s 	 	who	went	before	us	.
And	we	're	looking	 a 	 head 	 	at	 generation 	 s 	 	who	 re 	 ally 	 	need	us	to	 re 	 tool 	 	our	 live 	 s 	 	now	.
So	we	ask	that	you	join	us	in	 re 	 discover 	 ing 	 	the	value	of	 citizen 	 s 	 	 unit 	 ed 	 	,	and	to	declare	that	we	are	all	still	 pioneer 	 s 	 	.
When	I	was	little	--	and	by	the	way	,	I	was	little	once	--	my	father	told	me	a	story	about	an	18th	century	 watch 	 maker 	 	.
And	what	 th 	 is 	 	guy	had	 d 	 one 	 	:	he	used	to	produce	these	 fabulous 	 ly 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 watch 	 es 	 	.
And	one	day	,	one	of	his	 custom 	 ers 	 	came	 in 	 to 	 	his	 work 	 shop 	 	and	 ask 	 ed 	 	him	to	clean	the	watch	that	he	'd	 b 	 ought 	 	.
And	the	guy	took	it	 a 	 part 	 	,	and	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	he	 pull 	 ed 	 	out	was	one	of	the	balance	 wheel 	 s 	 	.
And	 a 	 s 	 	he	did	so	,	his	 custom 	 er 	 	 notice 	 d 	 	that	on	the	back	side	of	the	balance	wheel	was	an	 engrav 	 ing 	 	,	 we 	 re 	 	 word 	 s 	 	.
And	he	 s 	 aid 	 	to	the	guy	,	``	Why	have	you	put	stuff	on	the	back	that	no	one	will	ever	see	?	''
And	the	 watch 	 maker 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	around	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	God	can	see	it	.	''
 N 	 ow 	 	I	'm	not	in	the	 l 	 east 	 	bit	religious	,	 n 	 either 	 	was	my	father	,	but	at	that	point	,	I	 notice 	 d 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	here	.
I	felt	 some 	 thing 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 plex 	 us 	 	of	blood	 vessel 	 s 	 	and	 nerve 	 s 	 	,	and	there	must	be	some	 muscle 	 s 	 	in	there	 a 	 s 	 	well	 some 	 where 	 	,	I	guess	.
But	I	felt	 some 	 thing 	 	.
And	it	was	a	 physiologic 	 al 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	.
And	from	that	point	on	,	from	my	age	at	the	time	,	I	 beg 	 an 	 	to	think	of	 thing 	 s 	 	in	a	different	way	.
And	 a 	 s 	 	I	took	on	my	 care 	 er 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 design 	 er 	 	,	I	 beg 	 an 	 	to	ask	 my 	 self 	 	the	simple	question	:	Do	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	think	 beaut 	 y 	 	,	or	do	we	feel	it	?
 N 	 ow 	 	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	know	the	answer	to	 th 	 is 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	.
You	 prob 	 ably 	 	think	,	well	,	I	do	n't	know	which	one	you	think	it	is	,	but	I	think	it	's	about	 feel 	 ing 	 	 beaut 	 y 	 	.
And	so	I	then	 move 	 d 	 	on	 in 	 to 	 	my	design	 care 	 er 	 	and	 beg 	 an 	 	to	find	some	 excit 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
One	of	the	most	early	work	was	 d 	 one 	 	in	 auto 	 motive 	 	design	--	some	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	work	was	 d 	 one 	 	there	.
And	 dur 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	 th 	 is 	 	work	,	we	found	 some 	 thing 	 	,	or	I	found	 some 	 thing 	 	,	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 fascinate 	 d 	 	me	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	you	can	remember	it	.
Do	you	remember	when	 light 	 s 	 	used	to	just	go	on	and	off	,	click	click	,	when	you	closed	the	door	in	a	car	?
And	then	 some 	 body 	 	,	I	think	it	was	BMW	,	 introduc 	 ed 	 	a	light	that	went	out	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	.
 Re 	 member 	 	that	?
I	remember	it	 clear 	 ly 	 	.
Do	you	remember	the	first	time	you	 we 	 re 	 	in	a	car	and	it	did	that	?
I	remember	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	 think 	 ing 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	fantastic	.
In	fact	,	I	've	never	found	 any 	 body 	 	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	like	the	light	that	 go 	 es 	 	out	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	.
I	thought	,	well	what	the	hell	's	that	about	?
So	I	 start 	 ed 	 	to	ask	 my 	 self 	 	 question 	 s 	 	about	it	.
And	the	first	was	,	I	'd	ask	other	people	:	``	Do	you	like	it	?	''	``	Yes	.	''
``	Why	?	''	And	they	'd	say	,	``	Oh	,	it	 feel 	 s 	 	so	natural	,	''	or	,	``	It	's	nice	.	''
I	thought	,	well	that	's	not	good	 en 	 ough 	 	.
Can	we	cut	down	a	little	bit	further	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	 design 	 er 	 	,	I	need	the	 vocabul 	 ary 	 	,	I	need	the	 key 	 board 	 	,	of	how	 th 	 is 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 work 	 s 	 	.
And	so	I	did	some	 experiment 	 s 	 	.
And	I	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 real 	 ized 	 	that	there	was	 some 	 thing 	 	that	did	 exact 	 ly 	 	that	--	light	to	dark	in	six	 second 	 s 	 	--	 exact 	 ly 	 	that	.
Do	you	know	what	it	is	?	 Any 	 one 	 	?
You	see	,	using	 th 	 is 	 	bit	,	the	 think 	 y 	 	bit	,	the	 s 	 low 	 	bit	of	the	brain	--	using	that	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	a	think	,	it	's	a	feel	.
And	would	you	do	me	a	favor	?
For	the	next	14	 minute 	 s 	 	or	 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	,	will	you	feel	stuff	?
I	do	n't	need	you	to	think	so	much	 a 	 s 	 	I	want	you	to	feel	it	.
I	felt	a	sense	of	 relax 	 ation 	 	 temper 	 ed 	 	with	 anticip 	 ation 	 	.
And	that	thing	that	I	found	was	the	cinema	or	the	theater	.
It	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	just	 happen 	 ed 	 	here	--	light	to	dark	in	six	 second 	 s 	 	.
And	when	that	 happen 	 s 	 	,	are	you	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	going	,	``	No	,	the	movie	's	about	to	start	,	''	or	are	you	going	,	``	That	's	fantastic	.	I	'm	looking	forward	to	it	.
I	get	a	sense	of	 anticip 	 ation 	 	''	?
 N 	 ow 	 	I	'm	not	a	 neuro 	 scientist 	 	.
I	do	n't	know	even	if	there	is	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	a	 condition 	 ed 	 	 re 	 flex 	 	.
But	it	might	be	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	the	people	I	speak	to	in	the	 north 	 ern 	 	 hemi 	 sphere 	 	that	used	to	go	in	the	cinema	get	 th 	 is 	 	.
And	some	of	the	people	I	speak	to	that	have	never	 s 	 een 	 	a	movie	or	 be 	 en 	 	to	the	theater	do	n't	get	it	in	the	same	way	.
 Every 	 body 	 	 like 	 s 	 	it	,	but	some	like	it	more	than	 other 	 s 	 	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	 lead 	 s 	 	me	to	think	of	 th 	 is 	 	in	a	different	way	.
We	're	not	 feel 	 ing 	 	it	.	We	're	 think 	 ing 	 	 beaut 	 y 	 	is	in	the	 limb 	 ic 	 	system	--	if	that	's	not	an	 out 	 mod 	 ed 	 	idea	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	the	bits	,	the	pleasure	 center 	 s 	 	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	what	I	'm	 see 	 ing 	 	and	 sens 	 ing 	 	and	 feel 	 ing 	 	is	 bypass 	 ing 	 	my	 think 	 ing 	 	.
The	wiring	from	your	 sensor 	 y 	 	apparatus	to	 t 	 hose 	 	bits	is	 short 	 er 	 	than	the	bits	that	have	to	pass	through	the	 think 	 y 	 	bit	,	the	cortex	.
 The 	 y 	 	 arriv 	 e 	 	first	.
So	how	do	we	make	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	work	?
And	how	much	of	that	 re 	 active 	 	side	of	it	is	due	to	what	we	 al 	 ready 	 	know	,	or	what	we	're	going	to	learn	,	about	 some 	 thing 	 	?
 Th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	most	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	I	know	.
It	's	a	plastic	bag	.
And	when	I	 look 	 ed 	 	at	it	first	,	I	thought	,	no	,	there	's	no	 beaut 	 y 	 	in	that	.
 Th 	 en 	 	I	found	out	,	post	 expo 	 s 	 ure 	 	,	that	 th 	 is 	 	plastic	bag	if	I	put	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	 filth 	 y 	 	 pudd 	 le 	 	or	a	stream	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	 coli 	 form 	 s 	 	and	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 disgust 	 ing 	 	stuff	,	that	that	 filth 	 y 	 	water	will	 migr 	 ate 	 	through	the	wall	of	the	bag	by	osmosis	and	end	up	 in 	 side 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	 pur 	 e 	 	,	 pot 	 able 	 	 drink 	 ing 	 	water	.
And	all	of	a	sudden	,	 th 	 is 	 	plastic	bag	was	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	to	me	.
 N 	 ow 	 	I	'm	going	to	ask	you	 aga 	 in 	 	to	 s 	 witch 	 	on	the	 emotion 	 al 	 	bit	.
Would	you	mind	taking	the	brain	out	,	and	I	just	want	you	to	feel	 some 	 thing 	 	.
Look	at	that	.	What	are	you	 feel 	 ing 	 	about	it	?
 I 	 s 	 	it	 beaut 	 iful 	 	?	 I 	 s 	 	it	 excit 	 ing 	 	?
I	'm	 watch 	 ing 	 	your	 face 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 care 	 fully 	 	.
There	's	some	 ra 	 ther 	 	 bor 	 ed 	 - 	 looking 	 	 gentle 	 men 	 	and	some	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	 engag 	 ed 	 - 	 looking 	 	 lad 	 ies 	 	who	are	 pick 	 ing 	 	up	 some 	 thing 	 	off	that	.
 May 	 be 	 	there	's	an	 innoc 	 ence 	 	to	it	.
 N 	 ow 	 	I	'm	going	to	tell	you	what	it	is	.	 A 	 re 	 	you	ready	?
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	last	act	on	 th 	 is 	 	Earth	of	a	little	girl	 call 	 ed 	 	 He 	 idi 	 	,	five	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	before	she	 di 	 ed 	 	of	cancer	to	the	 s 	 pine 	 	.
It	's	the	last	thing	she	did	,	the	last	physical	act	.
Look	at	that	picture	.
Look	at	the	 innoc 	 ence 	 	.	Look	at	the	 beaut 	 y 	 	in	it	.
 I 	 s 	 	it	 beaut 	 iful 	 	now	?
 S 	 top 	 	.	 S 	 top 	 	.	How	do	you	feel	?
Where	are	you	 feel 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	?
I	'm	 feel 	 ing 	 	it	here	.	I	feel	it	here	.
And	I	'm	 watch 	 ing 	 	your	 face 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	your	 face 	 s 	 	are	 tell 	 ing 	 	me	 some 	 thing 	 	.
The	 lad 	 y 	 	over	there	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 cry 	 ing 	 	,	by	the	way	.
But	what	are	you	 do 	 ing 	 	?
I	watch	what	people	do	.
I	watch	 face 	 s 	 	.
I	watch	 react 	 ions 	 	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	I	have	to	know	how	people	react	to	 thing 	 s 	 	.
And	one	of	the	most	common	 face 	 s 	 	on	 some 	 thing 	 	 face 	 d 	 	with	 beaut 	 y 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	 stupefy 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 delic 	 ious 	 	,	is	what	I	call	the	 O 	 MG 	 	.
And	by	the	way	,	there	's	no	pleasure	in	that	face	.
It	's	not	a	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	 wonder 	 ful 	 	!	''
The	 eye 	 brow 	 s 	 	are	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	the	 eye 	 s 	 	are	 de 	 focused 	 	,	and	the	mouth	is	 hang 	 ing 	 	open	.
That	's	not	the	 express 	 ion 	 	of	joy	.
There	's	 some 	 thing 	 	else	in	that	.
There	's	 some 	 thing 	 	weird	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
So	pleasure	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	 temper 	 ed 	 	by	a	whole	 s 	 eries 	 	of	different	 thing 	 s 	 	coming	in	.
 Poign 	 ancy 	 	is	a	word	I	love	 a 	 s 	 	a	 design 	 er 	 	.
It	 mean 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 trigger 	 ing 	 	a	big	 emotion 	 al 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	,	often	 quit 	 e 	 	a	 s 	 ad 	 	 emotion 	 al 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	,	but	it	's	part	of	what	we	do	.
It	is	n't	just	about	nice	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	dilemma	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	paradox	,	of	 beaut 	 y 	 	.
 Sen 	 s 	 or 	 ily 	 	,	we	're	taking	in	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	--	 mix 	 ture 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	good	,	bad	,	 excit 	 ing 	 	,	 frighten 	 ing 	 	--	to	come	up	with	that	 sensor 	 ial 	 	 expo 	 s 	 ure 	 	,	that	 sens 	 ation 	 	of	what	's	going	on	.
 Path 	 os 	 	 appear 	 s 	 	 obvious 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	part	of	what	you	just	saw	in	that	little	girl	's	 draw 	 ing 	 	.
And	 al 	 so 	 	triumph	,	 th 	 is 	 	sense	of	 transcend 	 ence 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	``	I	never	 k 	 new 	 	that	.	Ah	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	new	.	''
And	that	's	 pack 	 ed 	 	in	there	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
And	 a 	 s 	 	we	assemble	these	 tool 	 s 	 	,	from	a	design	point	of	view	,	I	get	 terr 	 ibly 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	these	are	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	've	 al 	 ready 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	they	're	 arriv 	 ing 	 	at	the	brain	,	it	would	seem	,	before	cognition	,	before	we	can	 manipul 	 ate 	 	them	--	 electro 	 chemical 	 	party	 trick 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	what	I	'm	 al 	 so 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	is	:	 I 	 s 	 	it	possible	to	 separat 	 e 	 	intrinsic	and	 extr 	 in 	 s 	 ic 	 	 beaut 	 y 	 	?
By	that	,	I	mean	 intrinsic 	 ally 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	just	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	 exquisite 	 ly 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	that	's	 universal 	 ly 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
 Ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	find	.	 May 	 be 	 	you	've	got	some	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	it	.
 Ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	find	 some 	 thing 	 	that	,	to	 every 	 body 	 	,	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	thing	,	 with 	 out 	 	a	certain	amount	of	information	 pack 	 ed 	 	in	there	before	.
So	a	lot	of	it	 tend 	 s 	 	to	be	 extr 	 in 	 s 	 ic 	 	.
It	's	 mediate 	 d 	 	by	information	before	the	 comprehens 	 ion 	 	.
Or	the	information	's	 add 	 ed 	 	on	at	the	back	,	like	that	little	girl	's	 draw 	 ing 	 	that	I	 show 	 ed 	 	you	.
 N 	 ow 	 	when	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 beaut 	 y 	 	you	ca	n't	get	away	from	the	fact	that	a	lot	 experiment 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 d 	 one 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	with	 face 	 s 	 	and	what	have	you	.
And	one	of	the	most	 ted 	 ious 	 	 one 	 s 	 	,	I	think	,	was	 say 	 ing 	 	that	 beaut 	 y 	 	was	about	symmetry	.
Well	it	 obvious 	 ly 	 	is	n't	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	one	where	half	 face 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 show 	 n 	 	to	some	people	,	and	then	to	add	them	 in 	 to 	 	a	list	of	most	 beaut 	 iful 	 	to	 l 	 east 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	and	then	 ex 	 posing 	 	a	full	face	.
And	they	found	that	it	was	 al 	 most 	 	exact	 co 	 incidence 	 	.
So	it	was	n't	about	symmetry	.
In	fact	,	 th 	 is 	 	 lad 	 y 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 a 	 symmetric 	 al 	 	face	,	of	which	both	 side 	 s 	 	are	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
But	they	're	both	different	.
And	 a 	 s 	 	a	 design 	 er 	 	,	I	ca	n't	help	 meddl 	 ing 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	,	so	I	 pull 	 ed 	 	it	to	bits	and	sort	of	did	stuff	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	understand	what	the	individual	 element 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	,	but	 feel 	 ing 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	I	go	.
 N 	 ow 	 	I	can	feel	a	 sens 	 ation 	 	of	 de 	 light 	 	and	 beaut 	 y 	 	if	I	look	at	that	eye	.
I	'm	not	 get 	 ting 	 	it	off	the	 eye 	 brow 	 	.
And	the	 ear 	 hole 	 	is	n't	 do 	 ing 	 	it	to	me	at	all	.
So	I	do	n't	know	how	much	 th 	 is 	 	is	 help 	 ing 	 	me	,	but	it	's	 help 	 ing 	 	to	guide	me	to	the	 place 	 s 	 	where	the	 signal 	 s 	 	are	coming	off	.
And	 a 	 s 	 	I	say	,	I	'm	not	a	 neuro 	 scientist 	 	,	but	to	understand	how	I	can	start	to	assemble	 thing 	 s 	 	that	will	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	bypass	 th 	 is 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	part	and	get	me	to	the	 enjoy 	 able 	 	 pre 	 cognitive 	 	 element 	 s 	 	.
 Ana 	 is 	 	Nin	and	the	 Tal 	 mud 	 	have	told	us	time	and	time	 aga 	 in 	 	that	we	see	 thing 	 s 	 	not	 a 	 s 	 	they	are	,	but	 a 	 s 	 	we	are	.
So	I	'm	going	to	 shame 	 lessly 	 	 ex 	 pose 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	to	you	,	which	is	 beaut 	 iful 	 	to	me	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 F 	 1 	 	 M 	 V 	 	 Agus 	 ta 	 	.
 A 	 hhhh 	 	.
It	is	 re 	 ally 	 	--	I	mean	,	I	ca	n't	express	to	you	how	exquisite	 th 	 is 	 	object	is	.
But	I	 al 	 so 	 	know	why	it	's	exquisite	to	me	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	a	palimpsest	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
It	's	 masse 	 s 	 	and	 masse 	 s 	 	of	 layer 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	just	the	bit	that	 protr 	 ude 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	our	physical	dimension	.
It	's	 some 	 thing 	 	much	 big 	 ger 	 	.
 Lay 	 er 	 	after	layer	of	legend	,	 s 	 port 	 	,	 detail 	 s 	 	that	 reson 	 ate 	 	.
I	mean	,	if	I	just	go	through	some	of	them	now	--	I	know	about	 lam 	 in 	 ar 	 	flow	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	 air 	 - 	 pierc 	 ing 	 	 object 	 s 	 	,	and	that	 do 	 es 	 	it	 consum 	 mate 	 ly 	 	well	,	you	can	see	it	can	.
So	that	's	 get 	 ting 	 	me	 excit 	 ed 	 	.
And	I	feel	that	here	.
 Th 	 is 	 	bit	,	the	big	secret	of	 auto 	 motive 	 	design	--	 reflect 	 ion 	 	management	.
It	's	not	about	the	 shape 	 s 	 	,	it	's	how	the	 shape 	 s 	 	reflect	light	.
 N 	 ow 	 	that	thing	,	light	 flick 	 ers 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	you	move	,	so	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	 kine 	 tic 	 	object	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	it	's	 stand 	 ing 	 	still	--	 manage 	 d 	 	by	how	 brilli 	 ant 	 ly 	 	that	's	 d 	 one 	 	on	the	 reflect 	 ion 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	little	relief	on	the	 foot 	 plate 	 	,	by	the	way	,	to	a	rider	 mean 	 s 	 	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	going	on	 under 	 neath 	 	it	--	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	a	drive	chain	running	at	300	 mile 	 s 	 	and	hour	 prob 	 ably 	 	,	taking	the	power	from	the	engine	.
I	'm	 get 	 ting 	 	 terr 	 ibly 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	my	mind	and	my	 eye 	 s 	 	flick	 a 	 cross 	 	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 Titan 	 ium 	 	lacquer	on	 th 	 is 	 	.
I	ca	n't	tell	you	how	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	.
That	's	how	you	stop	the	nuts	coming	off	at	high	speed	on	the	wheel	.
I	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	now	.
And	of	course	,	a	 rac 	 ing 	 	bike	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	a	prop	stand	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	one	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	a	road	bike	,	it	all	 go 	 es 	 	away	and	it	 fold 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	little	gap	.
So	it	 disappear 	 s 	 	.
And	then	I	ca	n't	tell	you	how	hard	it	is	to	do	that	 radi 	 ator 	 	,	which	is	 curv 	 ed 	 	.
Why	would	you	do	that	?
 Be 	 cause 	 	I	know	we	need	to	 br 	 ing 	 	the	wheel	 far 	 ther 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 aero 	 dynamic 	 s 	 	.
So	it	's	more	expensive	,	but	it	's	 wonder 	 ful 	 	.
And	to	cap	it	all	,	 Agus 	 ta 	 	,	Count	 Agus 	 ta 	 	,	from	the	great	 histo 	 ries 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	.
The	bit	that	you	ca	n't	see	is	the	 gen 	 ius 	 	that	 create 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
 Mass 	 imo 	 	Tamburini	.
 The 	 y 	 	call	him	``	The	 P 	 lumber 	 	''	in	 It 	 a 	 ly 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	``	 Mae 	 stro 	 	,	''	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 actual 	 ly 	 	is	engineer	and	 craft 	 s 	 man 	 	and	 sculpt 	 or 	 	at	the	same	time	.
There	's	so	little	 com 	 promise 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	,	you	ca	n't	see	it	.
But	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	the	 like 	 s 	 	of	me	and	people	that	are	like	me	have	to	deal	with	 com 	 promise 	 	all	the	time	with	 beaut 	 y 	 	.
We	have	to	deal	with	it	.
So	I	have	to	work	with	a	supply	chain	,	and	I	've	got	to	work	with	the	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	and	I	've	got	to	work	with	 every 	 thing 	 	else	all	the	time	,	and	so	 com 	 promise 	 s 	 	start	to	fit	 in 	 to 	 	it	.
And	so	look	at	her	.
I	've	had	to	make	a	bit	of	a	 com 	 promise 	 	there	.
I	've	had	to	move	that	part	 a 	 cross 	 	,	but	 on 	 ly 	 	a	millimeter	.
No	one	's	 notice 	 d 	 	,	have	they	yet	?
Did	you	see	what	I	did	?
I	 move 	 d 	 	three	 thing 	 s 	 	by	a	millimeter	.
 Pre 	 tty 	 	?	Yes	.
 Beau 	 ti 	 ful 	 	?	 May 	 be 	 	 less 	 er 	 	.
But	then	,	of	course	,	the	consumer	 say 	 s 	 	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	matter	.
So	that	's	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	is	n't	it	?
 An 	 other 	 	millimeter	?
No	one	's	going	to	notice	 t 	 hose 	 	split	lines	and	 change 	 s 	 	.
It	's	that	easy	to	lose	 beaut 	 y 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 beaut 	 y 	 	's	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	difficult	to	do	.
And	 on 	 ly 	 	a	few	people	can	do	it	.
And	a	focus	group	can	not	do	it	.
And	a	team	 rare 	 ly 	 	can	do	it	.
It	 take 	 s 	 	a	central	cortex	,	if	you	like	,	to	be	able	to	 orchestra 	 te 	 	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 element 	 s 	 	at	the	same	time	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	water	bottle	--	some	of	you	know	of	it	--	 d 	 one 	 	by	Ross	 Love 	 grove 	 	,	the	 design 	 er 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	close	to	intrinsic	 beaut 	 y 	 	.	 Th 	 is 	 	one	,	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	you	know	what	water	is	like	then	you	can	experience	 th 	 is 	 	.
It	's	 love 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	an	 embodi 	 ment 	 	of	 some 	 thing 	 	 re 	 fresh 	 ing 	 	and	 delic 	 ious 	 	.
I	might	like	it	more	than	you	like	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	I	know	how	 blood 	 y 	 	hard	it	is	to	do	it	.
It	's	 stupefy 	 ing 	 ly 	 	difficult	to	make	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 re 	 fract 	 s 	 	light	like	that	,	that	 come 	 s 	 	out	of	the	tool	 correct 	 ly 	 	,	that	 go 	 es 	 	down	the	line	 with 	 out 	 	 fall 	 ing 	 	over	.
 Under 	 neath 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	like	the	story	of	the	 s 	 wan 	 	,	is	a	million	 thing 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	to	do	.
So	all	hail	to	that	.
It	's	a	fantastic	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	a	simple	object	.
And	the	one	I	 show 	 ed 	 	you	before	was	,	of	course	,	a	 massive 	 ly 	 	complex	one	.
And	they	're	 work 	 ing 	 	in	 beaut 	 y 	 	in	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	different	ways	 be 	 cause 	 	of	it	.
You	all	,	I	guess	,	like	me	,	enjoy	 watch 	 ing 	 	a	ballet	 danc 	 er 	 	dance	.
And	part	of	the	joy	of	it	is	,	you	know	the	 difficult 	 y 	 	.
You	 al 	 so 	 	may	be	taking	 in 	 to 	 	account	the	fact	that	it	's	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 pain 	 ful 	 	.
 Any 	 body 	 	 s 	 een 	 	a	ballet	 danc 	 er 	 	's	 to 	 es 	 	when	they	come	out	of	the	 point 	 s 	 	?
 Whi 	 le 	 	she	's	 do 	 ing 	 	these	 grace 	 ful 	 	 arabesque 	 s 	 	and	plies	and	what	have	you	,	 some 	 thing 	 	 horr 	 ible 	 	's	going	on	down	here	.
The	 comprehens 	 ion 	 	of	it	 lead 	 s 	 	us	to	a	 great 	 er 	 	and	 height 	 ened 	 	sense	of	the	 beaut 	 y 	 	of	what	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	going	on	.
 N 	 ow 	 	I	'm	using	 micro 	 second 	 s 	 	 wrong 	 ly 	 	here	,	so	 pleas 	 e 	 	 ignor 	 e 	 	me	.
But	what	I	have	to	do	now	,	 feel 	 ing 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	,	what	I	've	got	to	do	is	to	be	able	to	supply	 en 	 ough 	 	of	these	 enzyme 	 s 	 	,	of	these	 trigger 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	early	on	in	the	process	,	that	you	pick	it	up	,	not	through	your	 think 	 ing 	 	,	but	through	your	 feel 	 ing 	 	.
So	we	're	going	to	have	a	little	experiment	.
Right	,	are	you	ready	?	I	'm	going	to	show	you	 some 	 thing 	 	for	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	brief	moment	.
 A 	 re 	 	you	ready	?	 Oka 	 y 	 	.
Did	you	think	that	was	a	 bi 	 cycle 	 	when	I	 show 	 ed 	 	it	to	you	at	the	first	flash	?
It	's	not	.
Tell	me	 some 	 thing 	 	,	did	you	think	it	was	quick	when	you	first	saw	it	?	Yes	you	did	.
Did	you	think	it	was	modern	?	Yes	you	did	.
That	 bli 	 p 	 	,	that	information	,	shot	 in 	 to 	 	you	before	that	.
And	 be 	 cause 	 	your	brain	 start 	 er 	 	motor	 beg 	 an 	 	there	,	now	it	's	got	to	deal	with	it	.
And	the	great	thing	is	,	 th 	 is 	 	 motor 	 cycle 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 styl 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	way	 specific 	 ally 	 	to	 en 	 gender 	 	a	sense	that	it	's	green	technology	and	it	's	good	for	you	and	it	's	light	and	it	's	all	part	of	the	future	.
So	is	that	wrong	?
Well	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	it	is	n't	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 eco 	 logically 	 - 	 sound 	 	piece	of	technology	.
But	you	're	a	slave	of	that	first	flash	.
We	are	 slave 	 s 	 	to	the	first	few	 fraction 	 s 	 	of	a	second	--	and	that	's	where	much	of	my	work	 ha 	 s 	 	to	win	or	lose	,	on	a	shelf	in	a	shop	.
It	 win 	 s 	 	or	 lose 	 s 	 	at	that	point	.
You	may	see	50	,	100	,	200	 thing 	 s 	 	on	a	shelf	 a 	 s 	 	you	walk	down	it	,	but	I	have	to	work	 with 	 in 	 	that	domain	,	to	ensure	that	it	 get 	 s 	 	you	there	first	.
And	 final 	 ly 	 	,	the	layer	that	I	love	,	of	knowledge	.
Some	of	you	,	I	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	,	will	be	familiar	with	 th 	 is 	 	.
What	's	 in 	 credible 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	the	way	I	love	to	come	back	to	it	,	is	 th 	 is 	 	is	taking	 some 	 thing 	 	that	you	hate	or	 bore 	 s 	 	you	,	 fold 	 ing 	 	 clothe 	 s 	 	,	and	if	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	 th 	 is 	 	--	who	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	 th 	 is 	 	?	 Any 	 body 	 	try	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	?
Yeah	?
It	's	fantastic	,	is	n't	it	?
Look	at	that	.	Do	you	want	to	see	it	 aga 	 in 	 	?
No	time	.	It	 say 	 s 	 	I	have	two	 minute 	 s 	 	left	,	so	we	ca	n't	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
But	just	go	to	the	Web	,	YouTube	,	pull	it	down	,	``	 fold 	 ing 	 	 T 	 - 	 shirt 	 	.	''
That	's	how	 under 	 paid 	 	 young 	 er 	 - 	 aged 	 	people	have	to	fold	your	 T 	 - 	 shirt 	 	.
You	did	n't	 may 	 be 	 	know	it	.
But	how	do	you	feel	about	it	?
It	 feel 	 s 	 	fantastic	when	you	do	it	,	you	look	forward	to	 do 	 ing 	 	it	,	and	when	you	tell	 some 	 body 	 	else	about	it	--	like	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	have	--	you	look	 re 	 ally 	 	smart	.
The	knowledge	bubble	that	 s 	 it 	 s 	 	around	the	 out 	 side 	 	,	the	stuff	that	 cost 	 s 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	knowledge	is	free	--	 bundl 	 e 	 	that	together	and	where	do	we	come	out	?
Form	 follow 	 s 	 	function	?
 On 	 ly 	 	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	.	 On 	 ly 	 	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	.
Form	is	function	.	Form	is	function	.
It	 inform 	 s 	 	,	it	 tell 	 s 	 	us	,	it	 suppli 	 es 	 	us	 answer 	 s 	 	before	we	've	even	thought	about	it	.
And	so	I	've	 stop 	 ped 	 	using	 word 	 s 	 	like	``	form	,	''	and	I	've	 stop 	 ped 	 	using	 word 	 s 	 	like	``	function	''	 a 	 s 	 	a	 design 	 er 	 	.
What	I	try	to	pursue	now	is	the	 emotion 	 al 	 	 functional 	 ity 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	if	I	can	get	that	right	,	I	can	make	them	 wonder 	 ful 	 	,	and	I	can	make	them	 repeat 	 ed 	 ly 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	.
And	you	know	what	 t 	 hose 	 	 product 	 s 	 	and	 service 	 s 	 	are	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	own	some	of	them	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	'd	snatch	if	the	house	was	on	fire	.
 Form 	 ing 	 	the	 emotion 	 al 	 	bond	between	 th 	 is 	 	thing	and	you	is	an	 electro 	 chemical 	 	party	trick	that	 happen 	 s 	 	before	you	even	think	about	it	.
Thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
One	of	the	most	common	ways	of	 divid 	 ing 	 	the	world	is	 in 	 to 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	who	 believ 	 e 	 	and	 t 	 hose 	 	who	do	n't	--	 in 	 to 	 	the	religious	and	the	 atheist 	 s 	 	.
And	for	the	last	decade	or	so	,	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	clear	what	 be 	 ing 	 	an	atheist	 mean 	 s 	 	.
There	have	 be 	 en 	 	some	 ver 	 y 	 	vocal	 atheist 	 s 	 	who	've	 point 	 ed 	 	out	,	not	just	that	 relig 	 ion 	 	is	wrong	,	but	that	it	's	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	people	,	 man 	 y 	 	of	whom	have	lived	in	North	Oxford	,	have	 argu 	 ed 	 	--	they	've	 argu 	 ed 	 	that	 believ 	 ing 	 	in	God	is	 a 	 kin 	 	to	 believ 	 ing 	 	in	 fair 	 ies 	 	and	 essential 	 ly 	 	that	the	whole	thing	is	a	 child 	 ish 	 	game	.
 N 	 ow 	 	I	think	it	's	too	easy	.
I	think	it	's	too	easy	to	dismiss	the	whole	of	 relig 	 ion 	 	that	way	.
And	it	's	 a 	 s 	 	easy	 a 	 s 	 	 shoot 	 ing 	 	fish	in	a	barrel	.
And	what	I	'd	like	to	 inaugu 	 rate 	 	 to 	 day 	 	is	a	new	way	of	 be 	 ing 	 	an	atheist	--	if	you	like	,	a	new	version	of	 a 	 theism 	 	we	could	call	 A 	 theism 	 	2.0	.
 N 	 ow 	 	what	is	 A 	 theism 	 	2.0	?
Well	it	 start 	 s 	 	from	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 bas 	 ic 	 	 pre 	 mise 	 	:	of	course	,	there	's	no	God	.
Of	course	,	there	are	no	 de 	 ities 	 	or	 super 	 natural 	 	 spirit 	 s 	 	or	 angel 	 s 	 	,	etc	.
 N 	 ow 	 	let	's	move	on	;	that	's	not	the	end	of	the	story	,	that	's	the	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 begin 	 ning 	 	.
I	'm	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	the	kind	of	 constit 	 uency 	 	that	 think 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 a 	 long 	 	these	lines	:	that	 think 	 s 	 	,	``	I	ca	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	in	any	of	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	.
I	ca	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	in	the	 doctri 	 nes 	 	.
I	do	n't	think	these	 doctri 	 nes 	 	are	right	.
But	,	''	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	but	,	``	I	love	 Christ 	 ma 	 s 	 	 car 	 ol 	 s 	 	.
I	 re 	 ally 	 	like	the	art	of	 Man 	 teg 	 na 	 	.
I	 re 	 ally 	 	like	looking	at	old	 church 	 es 	 	.
I	 re 	 ally 	 	like	 turn 	 ing 	 	the	 page 	 s 	 	of	the	Old	 T 	 esta 	 ment 	 	.	''
 What 	 ever 	 	it	may	be	,	you	know	the	kind	of	thing	I	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	--	people	who	are	 attract 	 ed 	 	to	the	 ritual 	 istic 	 	side	,	the	 moral 	 istic 	 	,	 commun 	 al 	 	side	of	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	but	ca	n't	bear	the	 doctri 	 ne 	 	.
 Un 	 til 	 	now	,	these	people	have	 face 	 d 	 	a	 ra 	 ther 	 	 un 	 pleas 	 ant 	 	choice	.
It	's	 al 	 most 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	either	you	accept	the	 doctri 	 ne 	 	and	then	you	can	have	all	the	nice	stuff	,	or	you	reject	the	 doctri 	 ne 	 	and	you	're	living	in	some	kind	of	spiritual	 waste 	 land 	 	under	the	 gui 	 dance 	 	of	CNN	and	 Wal 	 mar 	 t 	 	.
So	that	's	a	sort	of	tough	choice	.
I	do	n't	think	we	have	to	make	that	choice	.
I	think	there	is	an	 alter 	 native 	 	.
I	think	there	are	ways	--	and	I	'm	 be 	 ing 	 	both	 ver 	 y 	 	 respect 	 ful 	 	and	 complete 	 ly 	 	 imp 	 ious 	 	--	of	 steal 	 ing 	 	from	 relig 	 ions 	 	.
If	you	do	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	in	a	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	wrong	with	 pick 	 ing 	 	and	 mix 	 ing 	 	,	with	taking	out	the	best	 side 	 s 	 	of	 relig 	 ion 	 	.
And	for	me	,	 a 	 theism 	 	2.0	is	about	both	,	 a 	 s 	 	I	say	,	a	 respect 	 ful 	 	and	an	 imp 	 ious 	 	way	of	going	through	 relig 	 ions 	 	and	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	What	here	could	we	use	?	''
The	secular	world	is	full	of	 hole 	 s 	 	.
We	have	 secular 	 ized 	 	 bad 	 ly 	 	,	I	would	 argu 	 e 	 	.
And	a	thorough	 stud 	 y 	 	of	 relig 	 ion 	 	could	give	us	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 in 	 sight 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 area 	 s 	 	of	life	that	are	not	going	too	well	.
And	I	'd	like	to	run	through	a	few	of	these	 to 	 day 	 	.
I	'd	like	to	kick	off	by	looking	at	education	.
 N 	 ow 	 	education	is	a	field	the	secular	world	 re 	 ally 	 	 believ 	 es 	 	in	.
When	we	think	about	how	we	're	going	to	make	the	world	a	better	place	,	we	think	education	;	that	's	where	we	put	a	lot	of	money	.
 Educ 	 ation 	 	is	going	to	give	us	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	commercial	 skill 	 s 	 	,	industrial	 skill 	 s 	 	,	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	going	to	make	us	better	people	.
You	know	the	kind	of	thing	a	 commen 	 cement 	 	address	is	,	and	 gradu 	 ation 	 	 ceremoni 	 es 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 lyric 	 al 	 	 claim 	 s 	 	that	education	,	the	process	of	education	--	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 high 	 er 	 	education	--	will	make	us	 in 	 to 	 	 noble 	 r 	 	and	better	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
That	's	a	 love 	 ly 	 	idea	.
 Inter 	 est 	 ing 	 	where	it	came	from	.
In	the	early	19th	century	,	church	 attend 	 ance 	 	in	Western	 Euro 	 pe 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	 slid 	 ing 	 	down	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 sharp 	 ly 	 	,	and	people	 panic 	 ked 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	question	.
 The 	 y 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	where	are	people	going	to	find	the	 moral 	 ity 	 	,	where	are	they	going	to	find	 gui 	 dance 	 	,	and	where	are	they	going	to	find	 source 	 s 	 	of	 consol 	 ation 	 	?
And	 in 	 fluent 	 ial 	 	 voice 	 s 	 	came	up	with	one	answer	.
 The 	 y 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	culture	.
It	's	to	culture	that	we	should	look	for	 gui 	 dance 	 	,	for	 consol 	 ation 	 	,	for	 moral 	 ity 	 	.
Let	's	look	to	the	 play 	 s 	 	of	Shakespeare	,	the	 dia 	 logues 	 	of	Plato	,	the	 novel 	 s 	 	of	Jane	 Au 	 sten 	 	.
In	there	,	we	'll	find	a	lot	of	the	 truth 	 s 	 	that	we	might	 previous 	 ly 	 	have	found	in	the	Gospel	of	Saint	John	.
 N 	 ow 	 	I	think	that	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	idea	and	a	 ver 	 y 	 	true	idea	.
 The 	 y 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	replace	 script 	 ure 	 	with	culture	.
And	that	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	plausible	idea	.
It	's	 al 	 so 	 	an	idea	that	we	have	 for 	 gotten 	 	.
If	you	went	to	a	top	university	--	let	's	say	you	went	to	Harvard	or	Oxford	or	 Cam 	 bridge 	 	--	and	you	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	I	've	come	here	 be 	 cause 	 	I	'm	in	search	of	 moral 	 ity 	 	,	 gui 	 dance 	 	and	 consol 	 ation 	 	;	I	want	to	know	how	to	live	,	''	they	would	show	you	the	way	to	the	 insan 	 e 	 	asylum	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 simpl 	 y 	 	not	what	our	 grand 	 est 	 	and	best	 institute 	 s 	 	of	 high 	 er 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	are	in	the	business	of	.
Why	?	 The 	 y 	 	do	n't	think	we	need	it	.
 The 	 y 	 	do	n't	think	we	are	in	an	 urge 	 nt 	 	need	of	 assist 	 ance 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	see	us	 a 	 s 	 	 adult 	 s 	 	,	rational	 adult 	 s 	 	.
What	we	need	is	information	.
We	need	data	,	we	do	n't	need	help	.
 N 	 ow 	 	 relig 	 ions 	 	start	from	a	 ver 	 y 	 	different	place	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	.
All	 relig 	 ions 	 	,	all	major	 relig 	 ions 	 	,	at	 vari 	 ous 	 	 point 	 s 	 	call	us	children	.
And	like	children	,	they	 believ 	 e 	 	that	we	are	in	severe	need	of	 assist 	 ance 	 	.
We	're	 on 	 ly 	 	just	 hold 	 ing 	 	it	together	.
 Per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	me	,	 may 	 be 	 	you	.
But	 any 	 way 	 	,	we	're	 on 	 ly 	 	just	 hold 	 ing 	 	it	together	.
And	we	need	help	.	Of	course	,	we	need	help	.
And	so	we	need	 gui 	 dance 	 	and	we	need	 did 	 act 	 ic 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	.
You	know	,	in	the	18th	century	in	the	 U. 	 K. 	 	,	the	 great 	 est 	 	 preach 	 er 	 	,	 great 	 est 	 	religious	 preach 	 er 	 	,	was	a	man	 call 	 ed 	 	John	 We 	 s 	 ley 	 	,	who	went	up	and	down	 th 	 is 	 	country	 deliver 	 ing 	 	 sermon 	 s 	 	,	 ad 	 vis 	 ing 	 	people	how	they	could	live	.
He	 deliver 	 ed 	 	 sermon 	 s 	 	on	the	 du 	 ties 	 	of	 parent 	 s 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	children	and	children	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	,	the	 du 	 ties 	 	of	the	rich	to	the	poor	and	the	poor	to	the	rich	.
He	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	tell	people	how	they	should	live	through	the	medium	of	 sermon 	 s 	 	,	the	classic	medium	of	 deliver 	 y 	 	of	 relig 	 ions 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	we	've	 give 	 n 	 	up	with	the	idea	of	 sermon 	 s 	 	.
If	you	 s 	 aid 	 	to	a	modern	liberal	 individual 	 ist 	 	,	``	Hey	,	how	about	a	sermon	?	''
they	'd	go	,	``	No	,	no	.	I	do	n't	need	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	.
I	'm	an	 in 	 dependent 	 	,	individual	person	.	''
What	's	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	a	sermon	and	our	modern	,	secular	mode	of	 deliver 	 y 	 	,	the	 lectur 	 e 	 	?
Well	a	sermon	 want 	 s 	 	to	change	your	life	and	a	 lectur 	 e 	 	 want 	 s 	 	to	give	you	a	bit	of	information	.
And	I	think	we	need	to	get	back	to	that	sermon	tradition	.
The	tradition	of	 sermon 	 izing 	 	is	 huge 	 ly 	 	 valu 	 able 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	are	in	need	of	 gui 	 dance 	 	,	 moral 	 ity 	 	and	 consol 	 ation 	 	--	and	 relig 	 ions 	 	know	that	.
 An 	 other 	 	point	about	education	:	we	tend	to	 believ 	 e 	 	in	the	modern	secular	world	that	if	you	tell	 some 	 one 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	once	,	they	'll	remember	it	.
Sit	them	in	a	 class 	 room 	 	,	tell	them	about	Plato	at	the	age	of	20	,	 s 	 end 	 	them	out	for	a	 care 	 er 	 	in	management	 consult 	 ancy 	 	for	40	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	that	 less 	 on 	 	will	stick	with	them	.
 Religion 	 s 	 	go	,	``	 Non 	 sense 	 	.
You	need	to	keep	 repeat 	 ing 	 	the	 less 	 on 	 	10	 time 	 s 	 	a	day	.
So	get	on	your	 knee 	 s 	 	and	repeat	it	.	''
That	's	what	all	 relig 	 ions 	 	tell	us	:	``	Get	on	you	 knee 	 s 	 	and	repeat	it	10	or	20	or	15	 time 	 s 	 	a	day	.	''
 Other 	 wise 	 	our	 mind 	 s 	 	are	like	 sieve 	 s 	 	.
So	 relig 	 ions 	 	are	 culture 	 s 	 	of	 re 	 petition 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	circle	the	great	 truth 	 s 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	and	 aga 	 in 	 	and	 aga 	 in 	 	.
We	associate	 re 	 petition 	 	with	 bore 	 dom 	 	.
``	 G 	 ive 	 	us	the	new	,	''	we	're	 al 	 ways 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	.
``	The	new	is	better	than	the	old	.	''
If	I	 s 	 aid 	 	to	you	,	``	 Oka 	 y 	 	,	we	're	not	going	to	have	new	TED	.
We	're	just	going	to	run	through	all	the	old	 one 	 s 	 	and	watch	them	five	 time 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	so	true	.
We	're	going	to	watch	Elizabeth	 Gil 	 bert 	 	five	 time 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	what	she	 say 	 s 	 	is	so	clever	,	''	you	'd	feel	 cheat 	 ed 	 	.
Not	so	if	you	're	 adopt 	 ing 	 	a	religious	 mind 	 set 	 	.
The	other	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 relig 	 ions 	 	do	is	to	arrange	time	.
All	the	major	 relig 	 ions 	 	give	us	 calendar 	 s 	 	.
What	is	a	calendar	?
A	calendar	is	a	way	of	making	 s 	 ure 	 	that	 a 	 cross 	 	the	year	you	will	bump	 in 	 to 	 	certain	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	.
In	the	Catholic	 chrono 	 logy 	 	,	Catholic	calendar	,	at	the	end	of	 Mar 	 ch 	 	you	will	think	about	 St 	 . 	 	 Jer 	 ome 	 	and	his	 qual 	 ities 	 	of	 humil 	 ity 	 	and	 good 	 ness 	 	and	his	 gene 	 ros 	 ity 	 	to	the	poor	.
You	wo	n't	do	that	by	accident	;	you	will	do	that	 be 	 cause 	 	you	are	 guide 	 d 	 	to	do	that	.
 N 	 ow 	 	we	do	n't	think	that	way	.
In	the	secular	world	we	think	,	``	If	an	idea	is	 import 	 ant 	 	,	I	'll	bump	 in 	 to 	 	it	.
I	'll	just	come	 a 	 cross 	 	it	.	''
 Non 	 sense 	 	,	 say 	 s 	 	the	religious	world	view	.
 Re 	 lig 	 ious 	 	view	 say 	 s 	 	we	need	 calendar 	 s 	 	,	we	need	to	structure	time	,	we	need	to	 synchron 	 ize 	 	 en 	 counter 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 come 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	 al 	 so 	 	in	the	way	in	which	 relig 	 ions 	 	set	up	 ritual 	 s 	 	around	 import 	 ant 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
Take	the	 Mo 	 on 	 	.	It	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	look	at	the	 Mo 	 on 	 	.
You	know	,	when	you	look	at	the	 Mo 	 on 	 	,	you	think	,	``	I	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	small	.	What	are	my	 problem 	 s 	 	?	''
It	 set 	 s 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	 etc 	 . 	 	,	etc	.
We	should	all	look	at	the	 Mo 	 on 	 	a	bit	more	often	.	We	do	n't	.
Why	do	n't	we	?	Well	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	tell	us	,	``	Look	at	the	 Mo 	 on 	 	.	''
But	if	you	're	a	Zen	Buddhist	in	the	middle	of	September	,	you	will	be	 order 	 ed 	 	out	of	your	home	,	made	to	stand	on	a	 can 	 on 	 ical 	 	platform	and	made	to	 celebr 	 ate 	 	the	 fest 	 ival 	 	of	Tsukimi	,	where	you	will	be	 give 	 n 	 	 poem 	 s 	 	to	read	in	honor	of	the	 Mo 	 on 	 	and	the	 pass 	 age 	 	of	time	and	the	 f 	 rail 	 ty 	 	of	life	that	it	should	 re 	 mind 	 	us	of	.
You	'll	be	 hand 	 ed 	 	rice	 cake 	 s 	 	.
And	the	 Mo 	 on 	 	and	the	 reflect 	 ion 	 	on	the	 Mo 	 on 	 	will	have	a	secure	place	in	your	heart	.
That	's	 ver 	 y 	 	good	.
The	other	thing	that	 relig 	 ions 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	aware	of	is	:	speak	well	--	I	'm	not	 do 	 ing 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	job	of	 th 	 is 	 	here	--	but	 or 	 atory 	 	,	 or 	 atory 	 	is	 absolute 	 ly 	 	key	to	 relig 	 ions 	 	.
In	the	secular	world	,	you	can	come	through	the	university	system	and	be	a	 lous 	 y 	 	speaker	and	still	have	a	great	 care 	 er 	 	.
But	the	religious	world	 do 	 es 	 	n't	think	that	way	.
What	you	're	 say 	 ing 	 	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	 back 	 ed 	 	up	by	a	 re 	 ally 	 	convincing	way	of	 say 	 ing 	 	it	.
So	if	you	go	to	an	African	American	 Pent 	 e 	 cost 	 alist 	 	church	in	the	American	South	and	you	listen	to	how	they	talk	,	my	 good 	 ness 	 	,	they	talk	well	.
After	every	convincing	point	,	people	will	go	,	``	 A 	 men 	 	,	 a 	 men 	 	,	 a 	 men 	 	.	''
At	the	end	of	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 r 	 ous 	 ing 	 	 para 	 graph 	 	,	they	'll	all	stand	up	,	and	they	'll	go	,	``	Thank	you	 Je 	 s 	 us 	 	,	thank	you	Christ	,	thank	you	 Sav 	 ior 	 	.	''
If	we	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	it	like	they	do	it	--	let	's	not	do	it	,	but	if	we	 we 	 re 	 	to	do	it	--	I	would	tell	you	 some 	 thing 	 	like	,	``	 Cultur 	 e 	 	should	replace	 script 	 ure 	 	.	''
And	you	would	go	,	``	 A 	 men 	 	,	 a 	 men 	 	,	 a 	 men 	 	.	''
And	at	the	end	of	my	talk	,	you	would	all	stand	up	and	you	would	go	,	``	Thank	you	Plato	,	thank	you	Shakespeare	,	thank	you	Jane	 Au 	 sten 	 	.	''
And	we	'd	know	that	we	had	a	real	rhythm	going	.
All	right	,	all	right	.	We	're	 get 	 ting 	 	there	.	We	're	 get 	 ting 	 	there	.
The	other	thing	that	 relig 	 ions 	 	know	is	we	're	not	just	 brain 	 s 	 	,	we	are	 al 	 so 	 	bodies	.
And	when	they	teach	us	a	 less 	 on 	 	,	they	do	it	via	the	body	.
So	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	take	the	 Jew 	 ish 	 	idea	of	 forgive 	 ness 	 	.
 Jew 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 forgive 	 ness 	 	and	how	we	should	start	 a 	 new 	 	and	start	 a 	 fresh 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	do	n't	just	deliver	us	 sermon 	 s 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	do	n't	just	give	us	 book 	 s 	 	or	 word 	 s 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	tell	us	to	have	a	bath	.
So	in	 Ortho 	 dox 	 	 Jew 	 ish 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	,	every	 Frida 	 y 	 	you	go	to	a	Mikveh	.
You	 immers 	 e 	 	 your 	 self 	 	in	the	water	,	and	a	physical	action	 back 	 s 	 	up	a	 philosoph 	 ical 	 	idea	.
We	do	n't	tend	to	do	that	.
Our	 idea 	 s 	 	are	in	one	area	and	our	behavior	with	our	bodies	is	in	 an 	 other 	 	.
 Religion 	 s 	 	are	 fasci 	 nating 	 	in	the	way	they	try	and	combine	the	two	.
Let	's	look	at	art	now	.
 N 	 ow 	 	art	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	in	the	secular	world	,	we	think	 ver 	 y 	 	 high 	 ly 	 	of	.	We	think	art	is	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
A	lot	of	our	 sur 	 plus 	 	wealth	 go 	 es 	 	to	 museum 	 s 	 	,	etc	.
We	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	hear	it	 s 	 aid 	 	that	 museum 	 s 	 	are	our	new	 cat 	 hedral 	 s 	 	,	or	our	new	 church 	 es 	 	.
You	've	heard	that	 say 	 ing 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	I	think	that	the	potential	is	there	,	but	we	've	 complete 	 ly 	 	let	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	down	.
And	the	reason	we	've	let	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	down	is	that	we	're	not	 proper 	 ly 	 	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	how	 relig 	 ions 	 	handle	art	.
The	two	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	 idea 	 s 	 	that	are	 hover 	 ing 	 	in	the	modern	world	that	inhibit	our	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	draw	strength	from	art	:	The	first	idea	is	that	art	should	be	for	art	's	sake	--	a	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	idea	--	an	idea	that	art	should	live	in	a	 her 	 me 	 tic 	 	bubble	and	should	not	try	to	do	 any 	 thing 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	 trouble 	 d 	 	world	.
I	could	n't	disagree	more	.
The	other	thing	that	we	 believ 	 e 	 	is	that	art	should	n't	explain	 it 	 self 	 	,	that	 artist 	 s 	 	should	n't	say	what	they	're	up	to	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	they	 s 	 aid 	 	it	,	it	might	destroy	the	spell	and	we	might	find	it	too	easy	.
That	's	why	a	 ver 	 y 	 	common	 feel 	 ing 	 	when	you	're	in	a	museum	--	let	's	admit	it	--	is	,	``	I	do	n't	know	what	 th 	 is 	 	is	about	.	''
But	if	we	're	serious	people	,	we	do	n't	admit	to	that	.
But	that	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	 puzzl 	 ement 	 	is	structural	to	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	art	.
 N 	 ow 	 	 relig 	 ions 	 	have	a	much	 s 	 an 	 er 	 	attitude	to	art	.
 The 	 y 	 	have	no	trouble	 tell 	 ing 	 	us	what	art	is	about	.
Art	is	about	two	 thing 	 s 	 	in	all	the	major	 faith 	 s 	 	.
 First 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 re 	 mind 	 	you	of	what	there	is	to	love	.
And	 second 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 re 	 mind 	 	you	of	what	there	is	to	fear	and	to	hate	.
And	that	's	what	art	is	.
Art	is	a	visceral	 en 	 counter 	 	with	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	of	your	faith	.
So	 a 	 s 	 	you	walk	around	a	church	,	or	a	mosque	or	a	 cat 	 hedral 	 	,	what	you	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 imbib 	 e 	 	,	what	you	're	 imbib 	 ing 	 	is	,	through	your	 eye 	 s 	 	,	through	your	 sense 	 s 	 	,	 truth 	 s 	 	that	have	 other 	 wise 	 	come	to	you	through	your	mind	.
 Essential 	 ly 	 	it	's	 propag 	 and 	 a 	 	.
 Rem 	 brand 	 t 	 	is	a	 propag 	 and 	 ist 	 	in	the	 Christ 	 ian 	 	view	.
 N 	 ow 	 	the	word	``	 propag 	 and 	 a 	 	''	 set 	 s 	 	off	alarm	 bell 	 s 	 	.
We	think	of	 Hit 	 ler 	 	,	we	think	of	Stalin	.	Do	n't	,	 necess 	 arily 	 	.
 Pro 	 pagan 	 da 	 	is	a	manner	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 did 	 act 	 ic 	 	in	honor	of	 some 	 thing 	 	.
And	if	that	thing	is	good	,	there	's	no	problem	with	it	at	all	.
My	view	is	that	 museum 	 s 	 	should	take	a	leaf	out	of	the	book	of	 relig 	 ions 	 	.
And	they	should	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	when	you	walk	 in 	 to 	 	a	museum	--	if	I	was	a	museum	 cur 	 ator 	 	,	I	would	make	a	room	for	love	,	a	room	for	 gene 	 ros 	 ity 	 	.
All	 work 	 s 	 	of	art	are	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	us	about	 thing 	 s 	 	.
And	if	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	arrange	 space 	 s 	 	where	we	could	come	 a 	 cross 	 	 work 	 s 	 	where	we	would	be	told	,	use	these	 work 	 s 	 	of	art	to	cement	these	 idea 	 s 	 	in	your	mind	,	we	would	get	a	lot	more	out	of	art	.
Art	would	pick	up	the	duty	that	it	used	to	have	and	that	we	've	 neglect 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	certain	 mis 	 - 	 found 	 ed 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	.
Art	should	be	one	of	the	 tool 	 s 	 	by	which	we	improve	our	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
Art	should	be	 did 	 act 	 ic 	 	.
Let	's	think	of	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
The	people	in	the	modern	world	,	in	the	secular	world	,	who	are	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 matter 	 s 	 	of	the	spirit	,	in	 matter 	 s 	 	of	the	mind	,	in	 high 	 er 	 	 soul 	 - 	 like 	 	 concern 	 s 	 	,	tend	to	be	 isolate 	 d 	 	 individual 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	 poet 	 s 	 	,	they	're	 philosoph 	 ers 	 	,	they	're	 photograph 	 ers 	 	,	they	're	 film 	 makers 	 	.
And	they	tend	to	be	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	our	cottage	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	.	 The 	 y 	 	are	 vulner 	 able 	 	,	single	people	.
And	they	get	 depress 	 ed 	 	and	they	get	 s 	 ad 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	.
And	they	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	change	much	.
 N 	 ow 	 	think	about	 relig 	 ions 	 	,	think	about	 organize 	 d 	 	 relig 	 ions 	 	.
What	do	 organize 	 d 	 	 relig 	 ions 	 	do	?
 The 	 y 	 	group	together	,	they	form	 institution 	 s 	 	.
And	that	 ha 	 s 	 	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 advantage 	 s 	 	.
First	of	all	,	scale	,	might	.
The	Catholic	Church	 pull 	 ed 	 	in	97	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	last	year	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	the	Wall	Street	Journal	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	massive	 machine 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	 collabor 	 ative 	 	,	they	're	 brand 	 ed 	 	,	they	're	 multi 	 national 	 	,	and	they	're	 high 	 ly 	 	 discipline 	 d 	 	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	all	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 qual 	 ities 	 	.
We	 recogn 	 ize 	 	them	in	relation	to	 corporation 	 s 	 	.
And	 corporation 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	like	 relig 	 ions 	 	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	they	're	right	down	at	the	bottom	of	the	pyramid	of	 need 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	selling	us	 shoe 	 s 	 	and	 car 	 s 	 	.
 Where 	 a 	 s 	 	the	people	who	are	selling	us	the	 high 	 er 	 	stuff	--	the	 therapist 	 s 	 	,	the	 poet 	 s 	 	--	are	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	and	they	have	no	power	,	they	have	no	might	.
So	 relig 	 ions 	 	are	the	 fore 	 most 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	an	institution	that	is	 fight 	 ing 	 	for	the	 thing 	 s 	 	of	the	mind	.
 N 	 ow 	 	we	may	not	agree	with	what	 relig 	 ions 	 	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	teach	us	,	but	we	can	admire	the	 institution 	 al 	 	way	in	which	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
 Book 	 s 	 	 al 	 one 	 	,	 book 	 s 	 	written	by	lone	 individual 	 s 	 	,	are	not	going	to	change	 any 	 thing 	 	.
We	need	to	group	together	.
If	you	want	to	change	the	world	,	you	have	to	group	together	,	you	have	to	be	 collabor 	 ative 	 	.
And	that	's	what	 relig 	 ions 	 	do	.
 The 	 y 	 	are	 multi 	 national 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	I	say	,	they	are	 brand 	 ed 	 	,	they	have	a	clear	 ident 	 ity 	 	,	so	they	do	n't	get	lost	in	a	 bus 	 y 	 	world	.
That	's	 some 	 thing 	 	we	can	learn	from	.
I	want	to	conclude	.
 Re 	 ally 	 	what	I	want	to	say	is	for	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	who	are	 oper 	 ating 	 	in	a	range	of	different	 field 	 s 	 	,	there	is	 some 	 thing 	 	to	learn	from	the	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 relig 	 ion 	 	--	even	if	you	do	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	any	of	it	.
If	you	're	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 any 	 thing 	 	that	's	 commun 	 al 	 	,	that	 involve 	 s 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	people	 get 	 ting 	 	together	,	there	are	 thing 	 s 	 	for	you	in	 relig 	 ion 	 	.
If	you	're	 involve 	 d 	 	,	say	,	in	a	travel	industry	in	any	way	,	look	at	 pil 	 grim 	 age 	 	.
Look	 ver 	 y 	 	 close 	 ly 	 	at	 pil 	 grim 	 age 	 	.
We	have	n't	 beg 	 un 	 	to	scratch	the	surface	of	what	travel	could	be	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	n't	 look 	 ed 	 	at	what	 relig 	 ions 	 	do	with	travel	.
If	you	're	in	the	art	world	,	look	at	the	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	what	 relig 	 ions 	 	are	 do 	 ing 	 	with	art	.
And	if	you	're	an	 educ 	 ator 	 	in	any	way	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	look	at	how	 relig 	 ions 	 	are	 spread 	 ing 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	.
You	may	not	agree	with	the	 idea 	 s 	 	,	but	my	 good 	 ness 	 	,	they	're	 high 	 ly 	 	effective	 mechan 	 ism 	 s 	 	for	 do 	 ing 	 	so	.
So	 re 	 ally 	 	my	 con 	 clud 	 ing 	 	point	is	you	may	not	agree	with	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	but	at	the	end	of	the	day	,	 relig 	 ions 	 	are	so	subtle	,	so	 complic 	 ated 	 	,	so	intelligent	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	that	they	're	not	fit	to	be	 abandon 	 ed 	 	to	the	religious	 al 	 one 	 	;	they	're	for	all	of	us	.
Thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
Chris	 And 	 er 	 son 	 	:	 N 	 ow 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 courage 	 ous 	 	talk	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	're	kind	of	setting	up	 your 	 self 	 	in	some	ways	to	be	 ridicul 	 ed 	 	in	some	 quarter 	 s 	 	.
AB	:	You	can	get	shot	by	both	 side 	 s 	 	.
You	can	get	shot	by	the	 hard 	 - 	 headed 	 	 atheist 	 s 	 	,	and	you	can	get	shot	by	 t 	 hose 	 	who	fully	 believ 	 e 	 	.
CA	:	 In 	 coming 	 	 mis 	 s 	 ile 	 s 	 	from	North	Oxford	at	any	moment	.
AB	:	 In 	 de 	 ed 	 	.
CA	:	But	you	left	out	one	 a 	 spect 	 	of	 relig 	 ion 	 	that	a	lot	of	people	might	say	your	agenda	could	borrow	from	,	which	is	 th 	 is 	 	sense	--	that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	to	 any 	 one 	 	who	's	religious	--	of	spiritual	experience	,	of	some	kind	of	 connect 	 ion 	 	with	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	 big 	 ger 	 	than	you	are	.
 I 	 s 	 	there	any	room	for	that	experience	in	 A 	 theism 	 	2.0	?
AB	:	 Absolute 	 ly 	 	.	I	,	like	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	,	meet	people	who	say	 thing 	 s 	 	like	,	``	But	is	n't	there	 some 	 thing 	 	 big 	 ger 	 	than	us	,	And	I	say	,	``	Of	course	.	''	And	they	say	,	``	So	are	n't	you	sort	of	religious	?	''
And	I	go	,	``	No	.	''	Why	 do 	 es 	 	that	sense	of	 myster 	 y 	 	,	that	sense	of	the	 dizzy 	 ing 	 	scale	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	need	to	be	 accompani 	 ed 	 	by	a	 mystic 	 al 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	?
Science	and	just	 observ 	 ation 	 	 give 	 s 	 	us	that	 feel 	 ing 	 	 with 	 out 	 	it	,	so	I	do	n't	feel	the	need	.
The	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	large	and	we	are	 tin 	 y 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	the	need	for	further	religious	 super 	 structure 	 	.
So	one	can	have	 so 	 - 	 call 	 ed 	 	spiritual	 moment 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	belief	in	the	spirit	.
CA	:	 Actu 	 ally 	 	,	let	me	just	ask	a	question	.
How	 man 	 y 	 	people	here	would	say	that	 relig 	 ion 	 	is	 import 	 ant 	 	to	them	?
 I 	 s 	 	there	an	 equi 	 valent 	 	process	by	which	there	's	a	sort	of	bridge	between	what	you	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	and	what	you	would	say	to	them	?
AB	:	I	would	say	that	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 gap 	 s 	 	in	secular	life	and	these	can	be	 plug 	 ged 	 	.
It	's	not	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	I	try	to	suggest	,	it	's	not	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	either	you	have	 relig 	 ion 	 	and	then	you	have	to	accept	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	,	or	you	do	n't	have	 relig 	 ion 	 	and	then	you	're	cut	off	from	all	these	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 thing 	 s 	 	.
It	's	so	 s 	 ad 	 	that	we	 constant 	 ly 	 	say	,	``	I	do	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	so	I	ca	n't	have	community	,	so	I	'm	cut	off	from	 moral 	 ity 	 	,	so	I	ca	n't	go	on	a	 pil 	 grim 	 age 	 	.	''
One	 want 	 s 	 	to	say	,	``	 Non 	 sense 	 	.	Why	not	?	''
And	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	the	spirit	of	my	talk	.
There	's	so	much	we	can	absorb	.
 A 	 theism 	 	should	n't	cut	 it 	 self 	 	off	from	the	rich	 source 	 s 	 	of	 relig 	 ion 	 	.
CA	:	It	 seem 	 s 	 	to	me	that	there	's	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	people	in	the	TED	community	who	are	 atheist 	 s 	 	.
But	 prob 	 ably 	 	most	people	in	the	community	 certain 	 ly 	 	do	n't	think	that	 relig 	 ion 	 	is	going	away	any	time	soon	and	want	to	find	the	language	to	have	a	 construct 	 ive 	 	 dial 	 ogue 	 	and	to	feel	like	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	talk	to	each	other	and	at	 l 	 east 	 	share	some	 thing 	 s 	 	in	common	.
 A 	 re 	 	we	 fool 	 ish 	 	to	be	 optimist 	 ic 	 	about	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	a	world	where	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 relig 	 ion 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	the	great	 r 	 ally 	 ing 	 	cry	of	divide	and	war	,	that	there	could	be	 brid 	 ging 	 	?
AB	:	No	,	we	need	to	be	polite	about	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	.
 Poli 	 te 	 ness 	 	is	a	 much 	 - 	 overlook 	 ed 	 	virtue	.
It	's	 s 	 een 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 hypo 	 cri 	 s 	 y 	 	.
But	we	need	to	get	to	a	stage	when	you	're	an	atheist	and	 some 	 one 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	Well	you	know	,	I	did	pray	the	other	day	,	''	you	 polite 	 ly 	 	 ignor 	 e 	 	it	.
You	move	on	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	you	've	 agree 	 d 	 	on	90	percent	of	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	have	a	 share 	 d 	 	view	on	so	 man 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	you	 polite 	 ly 	 	differ	.
And	I	think	that	's	what	the	religious	 war 	 s 	 	of	late	have	 ignor 	 ed 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	've	 ignor 	 ed 	 	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	 harmon 	 ious 	 	 disagree 	 ment 	 	.
CA	:	And	 final 	 ly 	 	,	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	new	thing	that	you	're	 pro 	 posing 	 	that	's	not	a	 relig 	 ion 	 	but	 some 	 thing 	 	else	,	 do 	 es 	 	it	need	a	 lead 	 er 	 	,	and	are	you	 volunteer 	 ing 	 	to	be	the	 pop 	 e 	 	?
AB	:	Well	,	one	thing	that	we	're	all	 ver 	 y 	 	suspicious	of	is	individual	 lead 	 ers 	 	.
It	 do 	 es 	 	n't	need	it	.
What	I	've	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	lay	out	is	a	 frame 	 work 	 	and	I	'm	 hop 	 ing 	 	that	people	can	just	fill	it	in	.
I	've	 sketch 	 ed 	 	a	sort	of	broad	 frame 	 work 	 	.
But	 where 	 ver 	 	you	are	,	 a 	 s 	 	I	say	,	if	you	're	in	the	travel	industry	,	do	that	travel	bit	.
If	you	're	in	the	 commun 	 al 	 	industry	,	look	at	 relig 	 ion 	 	and	do	the	 commun 	 al 	 	bit	.
So	it	's	a	wiki	project	.
CA	:	 A 	 lain 	 	,	thank	you	for	 spark 	 ing 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 conversation 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	.
We	 re 	 ally 	 	need	to	put	the	best	we	have	to	 off 	 er 	 	 with 	 in 	 	reach	of	our	children	.
If	we	do	n't	do	that	,	we	're	going	to	get	the	generation	we	deserve	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	going	to	learn	from	 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	they	have	around	them	.
And	we	,	 a 	 s 	 	now	the	elite	,	 parent 	 s 	 	,	 librarian 	 s 	 	,	 professional 	 s 	 	,	 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	,	a	bunch	of	our	 activ 	 ities 	 	are	,	in	fact	,	in	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	the	best	we	have	to	 off 	 er 	 	 with 	 in 	 	reach	of	 t 	 hose 	 	around	us	,	or	 a 	 s 	 	 broad 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	can	.
I	'm	going	to	start	and	end	 th 	 is 	 	talk	with	a	couple	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 carv 	 ed 	 	in	stone	.
One	is	what	's	on	the	 Bo 	 s 	 ton 	 	 Pub 	 lic 	 	 Libra 	 ry 	 	.
 Car 	 v 	 ed 	 	above	 the 	 ir 	 	door	is	,	``	Free	to	All	.	''
It	's	kind	of	an	inspiring	 state 	 ment 	 	,	and	I	'll	go	back	at	the	end	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
I	'm	a	librarian	,	and	what	I	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	is	 br 	 ing 	 	all	of	the	 work 	 s 	 	of	knowledge	to	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	people	 a 	 s 	 	want	to	read	it	.
And	the	idea	of	using	technology	is	perfect	for	us	.
I	think	we	have	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	 one 	 - 	 up 	 	the	 Greek 	 s 	 	.
It	's	not	easy	to	 one 	 - 	 up 	 	the	 Greek 	 s 	 	.	But	with	the	 industrious 	 ness 	 	of	the	 Egyptian 	 s 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	build	the	 Libra 	 ry 	 	of	 Alexa 	 nd 	 ria 	 	--	the	idea	of	a	copy	of	every	book	of	all	the	 people 	 s 	 	of	the	world	.
The	problem	was	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	had	to	go	to	 Alexa 	 nd 	 ria 	 	to	go	to	it	.
On	the	other	hand	,	if	you	did	,	then	great	 thing 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
I	think	we	can	 one 	 - 	 up 	 	the	 Greek 	 s 	 	and	 achiev 	 e 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	.
And	I	'm	going	to	try	to	 argu 	 e 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	one	point	 to 	 day 	 	:	that	universal	access	to	all	knowledge	is	 with 	 in 	 	our	grasp	.
So	if	I	'm	 success 	 ful 	 	,	then	you	'll	 actual 	 ly 	 	come	away	 think 	 ing 	 	,	 yea 	 h 	 	,	we	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	 achiev 	 e 	 	the	great	vision	of	 every 	 thing 	 	ever	 publish 	 ed 	 	,	 every 	 thing 	 	that	was	ever	 me 	 ant 	 	for	 distribut 	 ion 	 	,	 avail 	 able 	 	to	 any 	 body 	 	in	the	world	that	's	ever	 want 	 ed 	 	to	have	access	to	it	.
Yes	,	there	's	 issue 	 s 	 	about	how	money	should	be	 distribut 	 ed 	 	,	and	that	's	still	 be 	 ing 	 	 re 	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	.
But	I	'd	say	there	's	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	money	,	and	there	's	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	demand	,	so	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	 achiev 	 e 	 	that	.
But	I	'm	going	to	go	over	the	 techno 	 logical 	 	,	social	and	sort	of	where	are	we	 a 	 s 	 	a	whole	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	to	that	 part 	 icular 	 	vision	.
And	the	way	I	'm	going	to	try	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	is	do	it	like	the	 Amazon 	 .com 	 	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	,	the	 book 	 s 	 	,	music	,	video	and	just	go	step	--	media	type	by	media	type	,	just	go	and	say	,	all	right	,	how	're	we	 do 	 ing 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	?
So	if	we	start	with	 book 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	sort	of	where	are	we	?
Well	,	first	you	have	to	,	 a 	 s 	 	an	engineer	,	scope	the	problem	.	How	big	is	it	?
If	you	 want 	 ed 	 	to	put	all	of	the	 publish 	 ed 	 	 work 	 s 	 	 on 	 line 	 	so	that	 any 	 body 	 	could	have	it	 avail 	 able 	 	,	well	,	how	big	a	problem	is	it	?
Well	,	we	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	know	,	but	the	largest	print	library	in	the	world	is	the	 Libra 	 ry 	 	of	Congress	.	It	's	26	million	 volume 	 s 	 	,	26	million	 volume 	 s 	 	.
It	is	,	by	far	and	away	,	the	largest	print	library	in	the	world	.
And	a	book	,	if	you	had	a	book	,	is	about	a	 mega 	 byte 	 	,	so	--	you	know	,	if	you	had	it	in	 Micro 	 soft 	 	Word	.
So	a	 mega 	 byte 	 	,	26	million	 mega 	 byte 	 s 	 	is	26	 tera 	 byte 	 s 	 	--	it	 go 	 es 	 	 mega 	 - 	 	,	 giga 	 - 	 	,	 tera 	 - 	 	.	26	 tera 	 byte 	 s 	 	.
26	 tera 	 byte 	 s 	 	 fit 	 s 	 	in	a	computer	system	that	's	about	 th 	 is 	 	big	,	on	 s 	 pinning 	 	Linux	 drive 	 s 	 	,	and	it	 cost 	 s 	 	about	60,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
So	for	the	cost	of	a	house	--	or	around	here	,	a	 gar 	 age 	 	--	you	can	put	,	you	can	have	 s 	 pinning 	 	all	of	the	 word 	 s 	 	in	the	 Libra 	 ry 	 	of	Congress	.
That	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	neat	.
 Th 	 en 	 	the	question	is	,	what	do	you	get	?
You	know	,	is	it	worth	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	there	?
Do	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	want	it	 on 	 line 	 	?
Some	of	the	first	 thing 	 s 	 	that	people	do	is	they	make	book	 read 	 ers 	 	that	allow	you	to	search	 in 	 side 	 	the	 book 	 s 	 	,	and	that	's	kind	of	 f 	 un 	 	.
And	you	can	download	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	look	around	them	in	new	and	different	ways	.
And	you	can	get	at	them	 remote 	 ly 	 	,	if	you	happen	to	have	a	 lap 	 top 	 	.
There	's	 start 	 ing 	 	to	be	some	of	these	sort	of	page	 turn 	 - 	 y 	 	 inter 	 face 	 s 	 	that	look	a	whole	lot	like	 book 	 s 	 	in	certain	ways	,	and	you	can	search	them	,	make	little	 tab 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	kind	of	cute	--	still	 ver 	 y 	 	 book 	 - 	 like 	 	--	on	your	 lap 	 top 	 	.
But	I	do	n't	know	,	 read 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	on	a	 lap 	 top 	 	--	 when 	 ever 	 	I	pull	up	my	 lap 	 top 	 	,	it	 al 	 ways 	 	 feel 	 s 	 	like	work	.
I	think	that	's	one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	why	the	 Kind 	 le 	 	is	so	great	.
I	do	n't	have	to	feel	like	I	'm	at	work	to	read	a	 Kind 	 le 	 	.
It	's	 start 	 ing 	 	to	be	a	little	bit	more	 spec 	 ified 	 	.
But	I	have	to	say	that	there	's	 old 	 er 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	that	I	tend	to	like	.
I	like	the	physical	book	.
And	I	think	we	can	go	and	use	our	technology	to	go	and	 digit 	 ize 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	put	them	on	the	Net	,	and	then	download	,	print	them	and	bind	them	,	and	end	up	with	 book 	 s 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.
And	we	sort	of	 s 	 aid 	 	,	well	,	how	hard	is	 th 	 is 	 	?
And	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	not	be	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	.
We	 actual 	 ly 	 	went	off	to	make	a	 book 	 mobile 	 	.
And	a	 book 	 mobile 	 	--	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	a	van	with	a	satellite	dish	,	a	 print 	 er 	 	,	 bind 	 er 	 	and	cutter	,	and	 kid 	 s 	 	make	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 book 	 s 	 	.
It	 cost 	 s 	 	about	three	 dollar 	 s 	 	to	download	,	print	and	bind	a	normal	,	old	book	.
And	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	come	out	kind	of	nice	looking	.
You	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	get	 re 	 ally 	 	 good 	 - 	 looking 	 	 book 	 s 	 	for	on	the	order	of	one	 pen 	 ny 	 	per	page	,	sort	of	the	 part 	 s 	 	cost	for	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
So	the	idea	of	--	 th 	 is 	 	technology	 actual 	 ly 	 	may	end	up	 put 	 ting 	 	 book 	 s 	 	back	in	people	's	 hand 	 s 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.
There	are	some	other	 book 	 mobile 	 s 	 	running	around	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 Er 	 ic 	 	 El 	 d 	 red 	 	making	 book 	 s 	 	at	 Wal 	 den 	 	 Po 	 nd 	 	--	 Th 	 or 	 eau 	 	's	 work 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	just	before	he	got	 kick 	 ed 	 	out	by	the	 Park 	 s 	 	 Service 	 s 	 	,	for	 com 	 pet 	 ing 	 	with	the	 book 	 store 	 	there	.
In	India	,	they	've	got	 an 	 other 	 	couple	 book 	 mobile 	 s 	 	running	around	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 open 	 ing 	 	day	at	the	 Libra 	 ry 	 	of	 Alexa 	 nd 	 ria 	 	,	the	new	 Libra 	 ry 	 	of	 Alexa 	 nd 	 ria 	 	,	in	Egypt	.
It	was	 quit 	 e 	 	 popular 	 ly 	 	 attend 	 ed 	 	.
And	 kid 	 s 	 	 start 	 ing 	 	to	make	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 book 	 s 	 	,	and	a	happy	kid	with	the	first	book	that	he	's	ever	owned	.
So	the	idea	of	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	use	 th 	 is 	 	technology	to	end	up	with	paper	where	I	can	handle	sort	of	 sound 	 s 	 	a	little	retro	,	but	I	think	it	still	 ha 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	place	.
And	 be 	 ing 	 	from	the	Silicon	 Valle 	 y 	 	,	sort	of	 utopia 	 n 	 	sort	of	world	,	we	thought	,	if	we	can	make	 th 	 is 	 	technology	work	in	 r 	 ural 	 	Uganda	,	we	might	have	 some 	 thing 	 	.
So	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	got	some	 fund 	 ing 	 	from	the	World	Bank	to	try	it	out	.
And	we	found	in	about	30	 day 	 s 	 	we	could	go	and	take	a	couple	 folk 	 s 	 	from	Silicon	 Valle 	 y 	 	,	fly	them	to	Uganda	,	buy	a	car	,	set	up	the	first	Internet	 connect 	 ion 	 	at	the	National	 Libra 	 ry 	 	of	Uganda	,	figure	out	what	they	 want 	 ed 	 	,	and	get	a	program	going	making	 book 	 s 	 	in	 r 	 ural 	 	Uganda	.
And	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	--	so	 techno 	 logically 	 	,	it	 work 	 s 	 	.
What	we	found	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	we	did	n't	have	the	right	 book 	 s 	 	.
So	the	 book 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	in	the	library	.	We	could	get	it	to	people	,	if	they	're	 digit 	 ized 	 	,	but	we	did	n't	know	how	to	 quit 	 e 	 	get	them	 digit 	 ized 	 	.
 Every 	 body 	 	thought	the	answer	is	,	 s 	 end 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	to	India	and	China	.
And	so	we	've	 tri 	 ed 	 	that	,	and	I	'll	go	over	that	in	a	moment	.
There	are	some	 new 	 er 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	for	 deliver 	 ing 	 	that	have	 happen 	 ed 	 	that	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
One	is	a	 print 	 - 	 on 	 - 	 demand 	 	machine	that	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	 Ru 	 be 	 	 Gold 	 berg 	 	machine	.
We	have	one	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	now	.	It	's	 complete 	 ly 	 	cool	.
It	's	all	 convey 	 or 	 	belt	,	and	it	 make 	 s 	 	a	book	.
And	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	``	Espresso	Book	Machine	,	''	and	in	about	10	 minute 	 s 	 	,	you	can	press	a	button	and	make	a	book	.
 Some 	 thing 	 	else	I	'm	 quit 	 e 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	in	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	domain	,	beyond	these	sort	of	 kiosk 	 - 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	where	you	can	get	 book 	 s 	 	on	demand	,	is	some	of	these	new	little	 screen 	 s 	 	that	are	coming	out	.
And	one	of	my	 favor 	 ites 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	$	100	 lap 	 top 	 	.
And	I	do	n't	mean	to	steal	any	thunder	here	,	but	we	've	gone	and	used	one	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	to	be	an	 e 	 - 	 book 	 	 read 	 er 	 	.
So	here	's	one	of	the	beta	 unit 	 s 	 	and	you	can	--	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	be	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 good 	 - 	 looking 	 	 e 	 - 	 book 	 	 read 	 er 	 	.
And	we	have	a	quick	hack	that	we	did	to	try	to	put	one	of	our	 book 	 s 	 	on	it	,	and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	200	 dot 	 s 	 	per	inch	 mean 	 s 	 	that	you	can	put	 s 	 can 	 ned 	 	 book 	 s 	 	on	them	that	look	 re 	 ally 	 	good	.
At	200	 dot 	 s 	 	per	inch	,	it	's	kind	of	the	 equi 	 valent 	 	of	a	300	dot	print	laser	 print 	 er 	 	.
We	're	in	good	 en 	 ough 	 	shape	.
You	 actual 	 ly 	 	can	go	and	read	 s 	 can 	 ned 	 	 book 	 s 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 eas 	 ily 	 	.
So	the	idea	of	 electron 	 ic 	 	 book 	 s 	 	is	 start 	 ing 	 	to	come	about	.
But	how	do	you	go	about	 do 	 ing 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 canning 	 	?
So	we	thought	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	well	,	let	's	try	out	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 end 	 	 book 	 s 	 	to	India	thing	.
And	there	was	a	project	with	,	funded	by	the	National	Science	 Found 	 ation 	 	--	 s 	 ent 	 	a	bunch	of	 scanner 	 s 	 	,	and	the	American	 lib 	 r 	 aries 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	 s 	 end 	 	 book 	 s 	 	.
Well	,	they	did	n't	.	 The 	 y 	 	did	n't	want	to	 s 	 end 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 book 	 s 	 	.
So	we	 b 	 ought 	 	100,000	 book 	 s 	 	and	 s 	 ent 	 	them	to	India	.
And	then	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	why	you	do	n't	want	to	 s 	 end 	 	 book 	 s 	 	to	India	.
The	 less 	 on 	 	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	 s 	 can 	 	your	own	 book 	 s 	 	.
If	you	 re 	 ally 	 	care	about	 book 	 s 	 	,	you	're	going	to	 s 	 can 	 	them	better	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	if	they	're	 valu 	 able 	 	 book 	 s 	 	.
If	they	're	new	 book 	 s 	 	and	you	can	just	,	you	know	,	butcher	them	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	could	just	buy	 an 	 other 	 	one	,	that	's	not	 s 	 uch 	 	a	big	deal	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 do 	 ing 	 	 high 	 - 	 quality 	 	 s 	 canning 	 	.
But	do	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	love	.
But	the	 Indian 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 canning 	 	a	lot	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 book 	 s 	 	--	about	300,000	now	--	 do 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	well	.
The	 Chi 	 nese 	 	did	over	a	million	,	and	the	 Egyptian 	 s 	 	are	about	30,000	.
But	we	 s 	 ent 	 	--	thought	,	 O 	 K 	 	,	if	we	're	going	to	need	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	let	's	do	it	 in 	 - 	 library 	 	.
How	do	we	go	and	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	how	do	we	get	it	down	so	that	it	's	a	cost	point	that	we	could	afford	?
And	we	sort	of	 pick 	 ed 	 	the	price	point	of	10	 cent 	 s 	 	a	page	.
If	it	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	the	cost	of	 xerox 	 ing 	 	to	 bas 	 ically 	 	 digit 	 ize 	 	,	OCR	,	package	it	up	,	make	it	so	that	you	could	download	,	print	and	bind	it	--	the	whole	 she 	 bang 	 	--	we	would	have	 achiev 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	.
So	we	 start 	 ed 	 	out	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	.	How	do	we	get	to	10	 cent 	 s 	 	?
And	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	these	robot	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 work 	 ed 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	well	--	sort	of	these	 auto 	 - 	 page 	 - 	 turn 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
If	we	can	have	 Mar 	 s 	 	 R 	 over 	 s 	 	,	you	'd	think	you	could	turn	 page 	 s 	 	.
But	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	be	 pre 	 tty 	 	hard	to	turn	 page 	 s 	 	,	and	the	volume	is	n't	there	.
So	 any 	 way 	 	--	so	we	 end 	 ed 	 	up	making	our	own	book	scanner	,	and	with	two	digital	,	 high 	 - 	 grade 	 	,	professional	digital	 camera 	 s 	 	,	controlled	museum	 light 	 ing 	 	,	so	even	if	it	's	a	black	and	white	book	,	you	can	go	and	get	the	proper	 in 	 ton 	 ation 	 	.
So	you	 bas 	 ically 	 	do	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	 respect 	 ful 	 	job	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	fax	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	--	the	idea	is	to	do	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	job	 a 	 s 	 	you	're	going	through	these	 lib 	 r 	 aries 	 	.
And	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	10	 cent 	 s 	 	a	page	if	we	run	 thing 	 s 	 	in	volume	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	at	the	 Univers 	 ity 	 	of	 Tor 	 onto 	 	.
And	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	,	you	know	,	pay	a	living	wage	.
People	seem	to	love	it	.
Yes	,	it	's	a	little	 bor 	 ing 	 	,	but	some	people	kind	of	get	 in 	 to 	 	the	Zen	of	it	.
And	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	if	it	's	kind	of	 interest 	 ing 	 	 book 	 s 	 	that	you	care	about	,	in	 language 	 s 	 	that	you	can	read	.
We	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	do	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	job	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	at	 get 	 ting 	 	10	 cent 	 s 	 	a	page	.
So	10	 cent 	 s 	 	a	page	,	300	 page 	 s 	 	in	your	average	book	,	30	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	book	.
The	 Libra 	 ry 	 	of	Congress	,	if	you	did	the	whole	darn	thing	--	26	million	 book 	 s 	 	--	is	about	750	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	right	?
But	a	million	 book 	 s 	 	,	I	think	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	would	be	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	start	,	and	that	would	cost	30	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	.	That	's	not	that	big	a	bill	.
And	what	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	do	is	get	 in 	 to 	 	 lib 	 r 	 aries 	 	.
We	've	now	got	eight	of	these	 s 	 canning 	 	 center 	 s 	 	in	three	 count 	 ries 	 	,	and	 lib 	 r 	 aries 	 	are	up	for	 hav 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 book 	 s 	 	 s 	 can 	 ned 	 	.
The	 Get 	 ty 	 	here	is	moving	 the 	 ir 	 	 book 	 s 	 	to	the	 UC 	 LA 	 	,	which	is	where	we	have	one	these	 s 	 canning 	 	 center 	 s 	 	,	and	 s 	 canning 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 out 	 - 	 of 	 - 	 copy 	 right 	 	 book 	 s 	 	,	which	is	fabulous	.
So	we	're	 start 	 ing 	 	to	get	the	 institution 	 al 	 	 respons 	 ibility 	 	.
The	thing	we	're	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	is	the	10	 cent 	 s 	 	.
If	we	can	get	the	10	 cent 	 s 	 	,	all	the	rest	of	it	 flow 	 s 	 	.
We	've	 s 	 can 	 ned 	 	about	200,000	 book 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	we	're	 s 	 canning 	 	about	15,000	 book 	 s 	 	a	month	,	and	it	's	 start 	 ing 	 	to	gear	up	 an 	 other 	 	factor	of	two	from	there	.
So	all	in	all	,	that	's	going	 ver 	 y 	 	well	.
And	we	're	 start 	 ing 	 	to	move	out	of	the	just	 out 	 - 	 of 	 - 	 copy 	 right 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 out 	 - 	 of 	 - 	 print 	 	world	.
So	I	think	of	--	we	're	kind	of	going	from	the	 out 	 - 	 of 	 - 	 copy 	 right 	 	,	library	stuff	,	and	 Amazon 	 .com 	 	is	coming	from	the	 in 	 - 	 print 	 	world	.
And	I	think	we	'll	meet	in	the	middle	some	place	,	and	have	the	classic	thing	that	you	have	,	which	is	a	 publish 	 ing 	 	system	and	a	library	system	 work 	 ing 	 	in	parallel	.
And	so	we	're	 start 	 ing 	 	up	a	program	to	do	 out 	 - 	 of 	 - 	 print 	 	 work 	 s 	 	,	but	 loan 	 ing 	 	them	.
 Ex 	 act 	 ly 	 	what	 loan 	 ing 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	,	I	'm	not	 quit 	 e 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	.
But	 any 	 way 	 	,	 loan 	 ing 	 	 out 	 - 	 of 	 - 	 print 	 	 work 	 s 	 	from	the	 Bo 	 s 	 ton 	 	 Pub 	 lic 	 	 Libra 	 ry 	 	,	the	 Wood 	 s 	 	 Hol 	 e 	 	 Ocean 	 o 	 graphic 	 	Institute	and	a	few	other	 lib 	 r 	 aries 	 	that	are	 start 	 ing 	 	to	 particip 	 ate 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	program	,	to	try	out	 th 	 is 	 	model	of	where	 do 	 es 	 	a	library	stop	and	where	 do 	 es 	 	the	 book 	 store 	 	take	over	.
So	all	in	all	,	it	's	possible	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	in	large	scale	.
We	're	 al 	 so 	 	going	back	over	 micro 	 film 	 	and	 get 	 ting 	 	that	 on 	 line 	 	.
So	,	we	can	do	10	 cent 	 s 	 	a	page	,	we	're	going	15,000	 book 	 s 	 	a	month	and	we	've	got	about	250,000	 book 	 s 	 	 on 	 line 	 	,	 count 	 ing 	 	all	the	other	 project 	 s 	 	that	are	 start 	 ing 	 	to	add	in	.
So	what	I	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 argu 	 e 	 	is	,	 book 	 s 	 	are	 with 	 in 	 	our	grasp	.
The	idea	of	taking	on	the	whole	ball	of	wax	is	not	that	big	a	deal	.
Yes	,	it	 cost 	 s 	 	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	,	low	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	,	but	one	time	shot	and	we	've	got	 bas 	 ically 	 	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 print 	 ed 	 	 liter 	 ature 	 	 on 	 line 	 	.
And	then	,	there	's	business	model	 issue 	 s 	 	about	how	to	try	to	 effective 	 ly 	 	market	it	and	get	it	to	people	.
But	it	is	 with 	 in 	 	our	grasp	,	 techno 	 logically 	 	and	 law 	 - 	 wise 	 	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	for	the	out	of	print	and	out	of	 copy 	 right 	 	,	we	suggest	,	to	be	able	to	get	the	whole	darn	thing	 on 	 line 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	let	's	go	for	audio	,	and	I	'm	going	to	go	through	these	.
So	how	much	is	there	?
Well	,	 a 	 s 	 	best	we	can	tell	,	there	are	about	two	to	three	million	 dis 	 k 	 s 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 publish 	 ed 	 	--	so	78s	,	 long 	 - 	 play 	 ing 	 	 record 	 s 	 	and	 CD 	 s 	 	--	or	at	 l 	 east 	 	that	's	the	largest	 archiv 	 es 	 	of	 publish 	 ed 	 	 material 	 s 	 	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	sort	of	point	at	.
It	 cost 	 s 	 	about	10	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	piece	to	go	and	take	a	 dis 	 k 	 	and	put	it	 on 	 line 	 	,	if	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	in	volume	.
But	we	've	found	that	the	 right 	 s 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 thorn 	 y 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	 fair 	 ly 	 	 heav 	 ily 	 	 litig 	 ated 	 	area	,	so	we	've	found	that	there	are	 niche 	 s 	 	in	the	music	world	that	are	n't	 serv 	 ed 	 	 terr 	 ibly 	 	well	by	the	classic	commercial	 publish 	 ing 	 	system	.
And	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 start 	 ing 	 	to	make	these	 avail 	 able 	 	by	going	and	 off 	 er 	 ing 	 	shelf	space	on	the	Net	.
In	the	 Unit 	 ed 	 	 Stat 	 es 	 	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	cost	you	to	give	 some 	 thing 	 	away	.	Right	?
If	you	give	 some 	 thing 	 	to	a	 char 	 ity 	 	or	to	the	public	,	you	get	a	pat	on	the	back	and	a	tax	 don 	 ation 	 	--	 ex 	 cept 	 	on	the	Net	,	where	you	can	go	broke	.
If	you	put	up	a	video	of	your	 gar 	 age 	 	band	,	and	it	 start 	 s 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 heav 	 ily 	 	 access 	 ed 	 	,	you	can	lose	your	 guitar 	 s 	 	or	your	house	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	any	sense	.
So	we	've	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	 un 	 limit 	 ed 	 	 s 	 to 	 rage 	 	,	 un 	 limit 	 ed 	 	 band 	 width 	 	,	 fore 	 ver 	 	,	for	free	,	to	 any 	 body 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	to	share	that	 belong 	 s 	 	in	a	library	.
And	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	a	lot	of	 taker 	 s 	 	.	One	is	the	rock	'n	'	 roller 	 s 	 	.
The	rock	'n	'	 roller 	 s 	 	had	a	tradition	of	sharing	,	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	 no 	 body 	 	made	any	money	.	You	could	--	concert	 record 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	it	's	not	the	commercial	 record 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	but	concert	 record 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	 start 	 ed 	 	by	the	 G 	 rate 	 ful 	 	Dead	.
And	we	get	about	two	or	three	 band 	 s 	 	a	day	 sign 	 ing 	 	up	.
 The 	 y 	 	give	 per 	 mission 	 	,	and	we	get	about	40	or	50	 concert 	 s 	 	a	day	.
We	have	about	40,000	 concert 	 s 	 	,	 every 	 thing 	 	the	 G 	 rate 	 ful 	 	Dead	ever	did	,	up	on	the	Net	,	so	that	people	can	see	it	and	listen	to	 th 	 is 	 	material	.
So	audio	is	possible	to	put	up	,	but	the	 right 	 s 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	 thorn 	 y 	 	.
We	've	got	a	lot	of	 collect 	 ions 	 	now	--	a	couple	hundred	thousand	 item 	 s 	 	--	and	it	's	growing	over	time	.
 Mov 	 ing 	 	 image 	 s 	 	:	if	you	think	of	 the 	 a 	 tric 	 al 	 	 re 	 lease 	 s 	 	,	there	are	not	that	 man 	 y 	 	of	them	.
 A 	 s 	 	best	we	can	tell	,	there	are	about	150,000	to	200,000	 movie 	 s 	 	ever	that	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	for	a	 large 	 - 	 scale 	 	 the 	 a 	 tric 	 al 	 	 distribut 	 ion 	 	.	It	's	just	not	that	 man 	 y 	 	.
But	half	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 we 	 re 	 	Indian	.
But	 any 	 way 	 	,	it	's	 do 	 able 	 	,	but	we	've	 on 	 ly 	 	found	about	a	thousand	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	that	--	to	be	out	of	 copy 	 right 	 	.
So	we	've	 digit 	 ized 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	and	made	 t 	 hose 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	.
But	we	've	found	that	there	's	 lot 	 s 	 	of	other	 type 	 s 	 	of	 movie 	 s 	 	that	have	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 een 	 	the	light	of	day	--	 archiv 	 al 	 	 film 	 s 	 	.
We	've	found	,	 al 	 so 	 	,	a	lot	of	 politic 	 al 	 	 film 	 s 	 	,	a	lot	of	amateur	 film 	 s 	 	,	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 bas 	 ically 	 	 need 	 ing 	 	a	home	,	a	permanent	home	.
So	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 start 	 ing 	 	to	make	these	 avail 	 able 	 	and	it	's	grown	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	popular	.
We	're	not	 quit 	 e 	 	a	YouTube	.
We	 tend 	 ed 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 long 	 er 	 - 	 term 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	and	 al 	 so 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	people	can	 re 	 use 	 	and	make	 in 	 to 	 	new	 movie 	 s 	 	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	just	 be 	 en 	 	great	 f 	 un 	 	.
 Tele 	 vision 	 	 come 	 s 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	a	bit	 large 	 r 	 	.
We	 start 	 ed 	 	 record 	 ing 	 	20	 channel 	 s 	 	of	 tele 	 vision 	 	24	 hour 	 s 	 	a	day	.
It	's	sort	of	the	 big 	 gest 	 	TiVo	box	you	've	ever	 s 	 een 	 	.
It	's	about	a	 pet 	 a 	 byte 	 	,	so	far	,	of	 world 	 wide 	 	 tele 	 vision 	 	--	 Russia 	 n 	 	,	 Chi 	 nese 	 	,	 Japan 	 ese 	 	,	 Iraq 	 i 	 	,	Al	Jazeera	,	 BB 	 C 	 	,	CNN	,	 AB 	 C 	 	,	 C 	 B 	 S 	 	,	NBC	--	24	 hour 	 s 	 	a	day	.
We	 on 	 ly 	 	put	one	week	up	,	which	is	 most 	 ly 	 	for	cost	 reason 	 s 	 	,	which	is	the	9/11	,	sort	of	from	9/11/2001	.	For	one	week	,	what	did	the	world	see	?

 We 	 re 	 	they	?	Let	's	look	at	the	Palestinian	 tele 	 vision 	 	and	find	out	.
How	can	we	have	critical	 think 	 ing 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	quote	and	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	 compar 	 e 	 	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	past	?
And	 tele 	 vision 	 	is	 dread 	 fully 	 	 un 	 record 	 ed 	 	and	 un 	 quo 	 table 	 	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	by	Jon	 Stew 	 art 	 	,	who	 do 	 es 	 	a	fabulous	job	.
So	 any 	 way 	 	,	 tele 	 vision 	 	is	,	I	would	suggest	,	 with 	 in 	 	our	grasp	.
So	15	 dollar 	 s 	 	per	video	hour	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	about	100	 dollar 	 s 	 	to	150	 dollar 	 s 	 	per	 cell 	 ul 	 oid 	 	hour	,	we	're	able	to	go	and	get	 material 	 s 	 	 on 	 line 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 in 	 expensive 	 ly 	 	and	have	them	up	on	the	Net	.
And	we	've	got	,	now	,	a	lot	of	these	 material 	 s 	 	.
So	we	've	got	about	100,000	 piece 	 s 	 	up	there	.
So	 book 	 s 	 	,	music	,	video	,	 soft 	 ware 	 	.	There	's	 on 	 ly 	 	50,000	 title 	 s 	 	of	it	.
 Mo 	 st 	 ly 	 	the	 issue 	 s 	 	there	are	legal	 issue 	 s 	 	and	 break 	 ing 	 	copy	 protect 	 ions 	 	.
But	we	've	 work 	 ed 	 	through	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	,	but	we	've	still	got	real	 problem 	 s 	 	in	 Wash 	 ington 	 	.
Well	,	we	're	best	known	 a 	 s 	 	the	World	Wide	Web	.
We	've	 be 	 en 	 	 archiv 	 ing 	 	the	World	Wide	Web	since	1996	.
We	take	a	 snap 	 shot 	 	of	every	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	and	all	of	the	 page 	 s 	 	on	it	,	every	two	 month 	 s 	 	.
And	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 pioneer 	 ed 	 	by	Alexa	Internet	,	which	 don 	 ates 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 collect 	 ion 	 	to	the	Internet	 Arch 	 ive 	 	.
And	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	growing	 a 	 long 	 	for	the	last	11	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	a	fantastic	resource	.
And	we	've	made	a	 Way 	 back 	 	Machine	that	you	can	then	go	and	see	old	 web 	 s 	 ites 	 	kind	of	the	way	they	 we 	 re 	 	.
If	you	go	and	search	on	 some 	 thing 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	 Google 	 .com 	 	,	the	different	 version 	 s 	 	of	it	that	we	have	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	when	it	was	an	alpha	 re 	 lease 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	 look 	 ed 	 	like	at	 Stan 	 ford 	 	.
So	 any 	 way 	 	,	you	've	got	 bas 	 ically 	 	an	idea	of	where	 thing 	 s 	 	came	from	.
 Mo 	 st 	 ly 	 	,	people	want	to	see	 the 	 ir 	 	old	stuff	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
If	there	's	one	thing	that	we	want	to	learn	from	the	 Libra 	 ry 	 	of	 Alexa 	 nd 	 ria 	 	version	one	,	which	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	best	known	for	 burn 	 ing 	 	,	is	,	do	n't	just	have	one	copy	.
So	we	've	 start 	 ed 	 	to	--	we	've	made	 an 	 other 	 	copy	of	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	and	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	put	it	back	in	the	 Libra 	 ry 	 	of	 Alexa 	 nd 	 ria 	 	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	of	the	Internet	 Arch 	 ive 	 	at	the	 Libra 	 ry 	 	of	 Alexa 	 nd 	 ria 	 	.
And	we	now	have	 al 	 so 	 	 an 	 other 	 	copy	building	up	in	Amsterdam	.
So	,	we	should	put	it	in	the	San	 Andre 	 a 	 s 	 	 F 	 ault 	 	 Lin 	 e 	 	in	San	 Francis 	 co 	 	,	flood	zone	in	Amsterdam	and	in	the	Middle	East	.	Right	,	so	 any 	 way 	 	...
so	we	're	 hedg 	 ing 	 	our	 bet 	 s 	 	here	.
If	we	go	and	put	it	in	a	couple	more	 place 	 s 	 	,	I	think	we	'll	be	in	good	shape	.
There	's	a	 politic 	 al 	 	and	social	question	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
 I 	 s 	 	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	go	digital	,	is	it	going	to	be	public	or	private	?
There	's	some	large	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	that	have	 s 	 een 	 	 th 	 is 	 	vision	,	that	are	 do 	 ing 	 	 large 	 - 	 scale 	 	 digit 	 ization 	 	,	but	they	're	 lock 	 ing 	 	up	the	public	domain	.
The	question	is	,	is	that	the	world	that	we	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	live	in	?
What	's	the	role	of	the	public	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	the	private	 a 	 s 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	go	forward	?
How	do	we	go	and	have	a	world	where	we	both	have	 lib 	 r 	 aries 	 	and	 publish 	 ing 	 	in	the	future	,	just	 a 	 s 	 	we	 bas 	 ically 	 	 benefit 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	growing	up	?
So	universal	access	to	all	knowledge	--	I	think	it	can	be	one	of	the	 great 	 est 	 	 achiev 	 ement 	 s 	 	of	 human 	 kind 	 	,	like	the	man	on	the	moon	,	or	the	 Gut 	 en 	 berg 	 	Bible	,	or	the	 Libra 	 ry 	 	of	 Alexa 	 nd 	 ria 	 	.
It	could	be	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	're	 remember 	 ed 	 	for	,	for	millennia	,	for	 hav 	 ing 	 	 achiev 	 ed 	 	.
And	 a 	 s 	 	I	 s 	 aid 	 	before	,	I	'll	end	with	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	 carv 	 ed 	 	above	the	door	of	the	 Car 	 neg 	 ie 	 	 Libra 	 ry 	 	.
 Car 	 neg 	 ie 	 	--	one	of	the	great	 capital 	 ists 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	country	--	 carv 	 ed 	 	above	his	 leg 	 acy 	 	,	``	Free	to	the	People	.	''
Thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
I	would	like	to	talk	 to 	 day 	 	about	what	I	think	is	one	of	the	 great 	 est 	 	 adventure 	 s 	 	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	have	 embark 	 ed 	 	 up 	 on 	 	,	which	is	the	quest	to	understand	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	and	our	place	in	it	.
My	own	interest	in	 th 	 is 	 	subject	,	and	my	 pass 	 ion 	 	for	it	,	 beg 	 an 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	 accident 	 ally 	 	.
I	had	 b 	 ought 	 	a	copy	of	 th 	 is 	 	book	,	``	The	 Univers 	 e 	 	and	 Dr 	 . 	 	Einstein	''	--	a	used	 paper 	 back 	 	from	a	 second 	 hand 	 	 book 	 store 	 	in	 Sea 	 ttle 	 	.
A	few	 year 	 s 	 	after	that	,	in	 Bang 	 al 	 ore 	 	,	I	was	 find 	 ing 	 	it	hard	to	fall	 a 	 sleep 	 	one	night	,	and	I	 pick 	 ed 	 	up	 th 	 is 	 	book	,	 think 	 ing 	 	it	would	put	me	to	sleep	in	10	 minute 	 s 	 	.
And	 a 	 s 	 	it	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	I	read	it	from	 mid 	 night 	 	to	five	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	in	one	shot	.
And	I	was	left	with	 th 	 is 	 	 intens 	 e 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	awe	and	 exhila 	 ration 	 	at	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	and	our	own	ability	to	understand	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	we	do	.
And	that	 feel 	 ing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	left	me	yet	.
That	 feel 	 ing 	 	was	the	trigger	for	me	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	change	my	 care 	 er 	 	--	from	 be 	 ing 	 	a	 soft 	 ware 	 	engineer	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	science	writer	--	so	that	I	could	 par 	 take 	 	in	the	joy	of	science	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	the	joy	of	 commun 	 ic 	 ating 	 	it	to	 other 	 s 	 	.
And	that	 feel 	 ing 	 	 al 	 so 	 	led	me	to	a	 pil 	 grim 	 age 	 	of	 sort 	 s 	 	,	to	go	 liter 	 ally 	 	to	the	 end 	 s 	 	of	the	earth	to	see	 tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	,	 detect 	 ors 	 	,	 instrument 	 s 	 	that	people	are	building	,	or	have	built	,	in	order	to	 prob 	 e 	 	the	 cosmo 	 s 	 	in	 great 	 er 	 	and	 great 	 er 	 	detail	.
So	it	took	me	from	 place 	 s 	 	like	 Chi 	 le 	 	--	the	 A 	 ta 	 cama 	 	Desert	in	 Chi 	 le 	 	--	to	Siberia	,	to	 under 	 ground 	 	 mine 	 s 	 	in	the	 Japan 	 ese 	 	 Al 	 ps 	 	,	in	 North 	 ern 	 	America	,	all	the	way	to	 Antarctic 	 a 	 	and	even	to	the	South	 Pol 	 e 	 	.
And	 to 	 day 	 	I	would	like	to	share	with	you	some	 image 	 s 	 	,	some	 st 	 ories 	 	of	these	 trip 	 s 	 	.
I	have	 be 	 en 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	the	last	few	 year 	 s 	 	 document 	 ing 	 	the	 effort 	 s 	 	of	some	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 in 	 trepid 	 	men	and	women	who	are	 put 	 ting 	 	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	at	 time 	 s 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	at	 s 	 take 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	in	some	 ver 	 y 	 	remote	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 hostil 	 e 	 	 place 	 s 	 	so	that	they	may	gather	the	 faint 	 est 	 	 signal 	 s 	 	from	the	 cosmo 	 s 	 	in	order	for	us	to	understand	 th 	 is 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
And	I	first	begin	with	a	pie	chart	--	and	I	promise	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 on 	 ly 	 	pie	chart	in	the	whole	 present 	 ation 	 	--	but	it	 set 	 s 	 	up	the	state	of	our	knowledge	of	the	 cosmo 	 s 	 	.
All	the	 the 	 ories 	 	in	physics	that	we	have	 to 	 day 	 	 proper 	 ly 	 	explain	what	is	 call 	 ed 	 	normal	matter	--	the	stuff	that	we	're	all	made	of	--	and	that	's	four	percent	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
 Astronomer 	 s 	 	and	 cosmo 	 logists 	 	and	 physicist 	 s 	 	think	that	there	is	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	dark	matter	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	which	 make 	 s 	 	up	23	percent	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	and	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	dark	energy	,	which	 permeate 	 s 	 	the	fabric	of	 space 	 - 	 time 	 	,	that	 make 	 s 	 	up	 an 	 other 	 	73	percent	.
So	if	you	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	pie	chart	,	96	percent	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	in	our	exploration	of	it	,	is	 un 	 known 	 	or	not	well	 under 	 stood 	 	.
And	most	of	the	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	 tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	that	I	went	to	see	are	in	some	way	 address 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	question	,	these	two	 t 	 win 	 	 myster 	 ies 	 	of	dark	matter	and	dark	energy	.
I	will	take	you	first	to	an	 under 	 ground 	 	mine	in	 North 	 ern 	 	Minnesota	where	people	are	looking	for	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	dark	matter	.
And	the	idea	here	is	that	they	are	looking	for	a	sign	of	a	dark	matter	particle	hitting	one	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 detect 	 ors 	 	.
And	the	reason	why	they	have	to	go	 under 	 ground 	 	is	that	,	if	you	did	 th 	 is 	 	experiment	on	the	surface	of	the	Earth	,	the	same	experiment	would	be	 swamp 	 ed 	 	by	 signal 	 s 	 	that	could	be	 create 	 d 	 	by	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 cosm 	 ic 	 	 ray 	 s 	 	,	 ambi 	 ent 	 	radio	activity	,	even	our	own	bodies	.	You	might	not	 believ 	 e 	 	it	,	but	even	our	own	bodies	are	 radio 	 active 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	to	disturb	 th 	 is 	 	experiment	.
So	they	go	deep	 in 	 side 	 	 mine 	 s 	 	to	find	a	kind	of	 environment 	 al 	 	silence	that	will	allow	them	to	hear	the	ping	of	a	dark	matter	particle	hitting	 the 	 ir 	 	 detect 	 or 	 	.
And	I	went	to	see	one	of	these	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	--	you	can	 bare 	 ly 	 	see	it	,	and	the	reason	for	that	is	it	's	 entire 	 ly 	 	dark	in	there	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	cavern	that	was	left	 be 	 hind 	 	by	the	 min 	 ers 	 	who	left	 th 	 is 	 	mine	in	1960	.
And	 physicist 	 s 	 	came	and	 start 	 ed 	 	using	it	 some 	 time 	 	in	the	1980s	.
And	the	 min 	 ers 	 	in	the	early	part	of	the	last	century	 work 	 ed 	 	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	in	 candle 	 light 	 	.
And	 to 	 day 	 	,	you	would	see	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 side 	 	the	mine	,	half	a	mile	 under 	 ground 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	largest	 under 	 ground 	 	 lab 	 s 	 	in	the	world	.
And	,	among	other	 thing 	 s 	 	,	they	're	looking	for	dark	matter	.
There	is	 an 	 other 	 	way	to	search	for	dark	matter	,	which	is	 in 	 direct 	 ly 	 	.
If	dark	matter	 exist 	 s 	 	in	our	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	in	our	 galax 	 y 	 	,	then	these	 particle 	 s 	 	should	be	 s 	 mash 	 ing 	 	together	and	producing	other	 particle 	 s 	 	that	we	know	about	--	one	of	them	 be 	 ing 	 	 neutrino 	 s 	 	.
And	 neutrino 	 s 	 	you	can	detect	by	the	signature	they	 leav 	 e 	 	when	they	hit	water	 molecule 	 s 	 	.
When	a	neutrino	 hit 	 s 	 	a	water	molecule	it	 emit 	 s 	 	a	kind	of	blue	light	,	a	flash	of	blue	light	,	and	by	looking	for	 th 	 is 	 	blue	light	,	you	can	 essential 	 ly 	 	understand	 some 	 thing 	 	about	the	neutrino	and	then	,	 in 	 direct 	 ly 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	about	the	dark	matter	that	might	have	 create 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	neutrino	.
But	you	need	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	large	 volume 	 s 	 	of	water	in	order	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
You	need	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 mega 	 ton 	 s 	 	of	water	--	 al 	 most 	 	a	 giga 	 ton 	 	of	water	--	in	order	to	have	any	chance	of	 catch 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	neutrino	.
And	where	in	the	world	would	you	find	 s 	 uch 	 	water	?
Well	the	 Russia 	 ns 	 	have	a	tank	in	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 back 	 yard 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	Lake	 Bai 	 k 	 al 	 	.
It	is	the	largest	lake	in	the	world	.	It	's	800	km	long	.
It	's	about	40	to	50	km	wide	in	most	 place 	 s 	 	,	and	one	to	two	 kilometer 	 s 	 	deep	.
And	what	the	 Russia 	 ns 	 	are	 do 	 ing 	 	is	they	're	building	these	 detect 	 ors 	 	and	 immers 	 ing 	 	them	about	a	kilometer	 be 	 neath 	 	the	surface	of	the	lake	so	that	they	can	watch	for	these	 flash 	 es 	 	of	blue	light	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	scene	that	 greet 	 ed 	 	me	when	I	 land 	 ed 	 	there	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	Lake	 Bai 	 k 	 al 	 	in	the	peak	of	the	 Siberia 	 n 	 	winter	.
The	lake	is	 entire 	 ly 	 	 froze 	 n 	 	.
And	the	line	of	black	 dot 	 s 	 	that	you	see	in	the	 back 	 ground 	 	,	that	's	the	ice	camp	where	the	 physicist 	 s 	 	are	 work 	 ing 	 	.
The	reason	why	they	have	to	work	in	winter	is	 be 	 cause 	 	they	do	n't	have	the	money	to	work	in	summer	and	spring	,	which	,	if	they	did	that	,	they	would	need	 ship 	 s 	 	and	 submersible 	 s 	 	to	do	 the 	 ir 	 	work	.
So	they	wait	 un 	 til 	 	winter	--	the	lake	is	 complete 	 ly 	 	 froze 	 n 	 	over	--	and	they	use	 th 	 is 	 	 meter 	 - 	 thick 	 	ice	 a 	 s 	 	a	platform	on	which	to	establish	 the 	 ir 	 	ice	camp	and	do	 the 	 ir 	 	work	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 Russia 	 ns 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	the	ice	in	the	peak	of	the	 Siberia 	 n 	 	winter	.
 The 	 y 	 	have	to	drill	 hole 	 s 	 	in	the	ice	,	 d 	 ive 	 	down	 in 	 to 	 	the	water	--	cold	,	cold	water	--	to	get	hold	of	the	instrument	,	 br 	 ing 	 	it	up	,	do	any	 repair 	 s 	 	and	maintenance	that	they	need	to	do	,	put	it	back	and	get	out	before	the	ice	 melt 	 s 	 	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	that	phase	of	solid	ice	 last 	 s 	 	for	two	 month 	 s 	 	and	it	's	full	of	 crack 	 s 	 	.
And	you	have	to	imagine	,	there	's	an	entire	 sea 	 - 	 like 	 	lake	 under 	 neath 	 	,	moving	.
I	still	do	n't	understand	 th 	 is 	 	one	 Russia 	 n 	 	man	 work 	 ing 	 	in	his	bare	chest	,	but	that	 tell 	 s 	 	you	how	hard	he	was	 work 	 ing 	 	.
And	these	people	,	a	 hand 	 ful 	 	of	people	,	have	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	for	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	looking	for	 particle 	 s 	 	that	may	or	may	not	exist	.
And	they	have	 dedicate 	 d 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	to	it	.
And	just	to	give	you	an	idea	,	they	have	 s 	 pent 	 	20	million	over	20	 year 	 s 	 	.
It	's	 ver 	 y 	 	harsh	 condition 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	work	on	a	 shoe 	 string 	 	budget	.
The	 toilet 	 s 	 	there	are	 liter 	 ally 	 	 hole 	 s 	 	in	the	ground	 cover 	 ed 	 	with	a	 wood 	 en 	 	 s 	 hack 	 	.
And	it	's	that	 bas 	 ic 	 	,	but	they	do	 th 	 is 	 	every	year	.
From	Siberia	to	the	 A 	 ta 	 cama 	 	Desert	in	 Chi 	 le 	 	,	to	see	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	The	 Ver 	 y 	 	Large	 Tele 	 scope 	 	.
The	 Ver 	 y 	 	Large	 Tele 	 scope 	 	is	one	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 astronomer 	 s 	 	do	--	they	name	 the 	 ir 	 	 tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	 un 	 imagin 	 ative 	 ly 	 	.
I	can	tell	you	for	a	fact	,	that	the	next	one	that	they	're	 plan 	 ning 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	The	 Extreme 	 ly 	 	Large	 Tele 	 scope 	 	.
And	you	would	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	it	,	but	the	one	after	that	is	going	to	be	 call 	 ed 	 	The	 Over 	 w 	 helm 	 ing 	 ly 	 	Large	 Tele 	 scope 	 	.
But	 non 	 e 	 the 	 less 	 	,	it	's	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	piece	of	 engineer 	 ing 	 	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	four	8.2	meter	 tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	.
And	these	 tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	,	among	other	 thing 	 s 	 	,	they	're	 be 	 ing 	 	used	to	 stud 	 y 	 	how	the	expansion	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	changing	with	time	.
And	the	more	you	understand	that	,	the	better	you	would	understand	what	 th 	 is 	 	dark	energy	that	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	made	of	is	all	about	.
And	one	piece	of	 engineer 	 ing 	 	that	I	want	to	 leav 	 e 	 	you	with	 a 	 s 	 	 regard 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 tele 	 scope 	 	is	the	mirror	.
 E 	 ach 	 	mirror	,	there	are	four	of	them	,	is	made	of	a	single	piece	of	glass	,	a	 monolith 	 ic 	 	piece	of	 high 	 - 	 tech 	 	ceramic	,	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	ground	down	and	 polish 	 ed 	 	to	 s 	 uch 	 	 accu 	 racy 	 	that	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	to	understand	what	that	is	is	[	to	]	imagine	a	city	like	Paris	,	with	all	 it 	 s 	 	 building 	 s 	 	and	the	Eiffel	Tower	,	if	you	grind	down	Paris	to	that	kind	of	 accu 	 racy 	 	,	you	would	be	left	with	 bump 	 s 	 	that	are	one	millimeter	high	.
And	that	's	the	kind	of	 polish 	 ing 	 	that	these	 mirror 	 s 	 	have	 endur 	 ed 	 	.
An	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	set	of	 tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	.
 He 	 re 	 	's	 an 	 other 	 	view	of	the	same	.
The	reason	why	you	have	to	build	these	 tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	in	 place 	 s 	 	like	the	 A 	 ta 	 cama 	 	Desert	is	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	high	altitude	desert	.
The	dry	air	is	 re 	 ally 	 	good	for	 tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	,	the	cloud	cover	is	 be 	 low 	 	the	 summ 	 it 	 	of	these	 mountain 	 s 	 	so	that	the	 tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	have	about	300	 day 	 s 	 	of	clear	 ski 	 es 	 	.
 Fin 	 ally 	 	,	I	want	to	take	you	to	 Antarctic 	 a 	 	.
I	want	to	 s 	 pend 	 	most	of	my	time	on	 th 	 is 	 	part	of	the	world	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 cosmo 	 logy 	 	's	final	 front 	 ier 	 	.
Some	of	the	most	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	some	of	the	most	 extrem 	 e 	 	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 d 	 one 	 	in	 Antarctic 	 a 	 	.
I	was	there	to	view	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	a	 long 	 - 	 dur 	 ation 	 	balloon	flight	,	which	 bas 	 ically 	 	 take 	 s 	 	 tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	and	 instrument 	 s 	 	all	the	way	to	the	upper	atmosphere	,	the	upper	 strato 	 sphere 	 	,	40	km	up	.
And	that	's	where	they	do	 the 	 ir 	 	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	and	then	the	balloon	,	the	 pay 	 load 	 	,	is	 br 	 ought 	 	down	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	is	us	 land 	 ing 	 	on	the	Ross	Ice	 She 	 lf 	 	in	 Antarctic 	 a 	 	.
That	's	an	American	 C 	 - 	 17 	 	 car 	 go 	 	plane	that	flew	us	from	New	Zealand	to	McMurdo	in	 Antarctic 	 a 	 	.
And	here	we	are	about	to	board	our	bus	.
And	I	do	n't	know	if	you	can	read	the	 letter 	 ing 	 	,	but	it	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 I 	 van 	 	the	 Terr 	 ibu 	 s 	 	.	''
And	that	's	taking	us	to	McMurdo	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	scene	that	 greet 	 s 	 	you	in	McMurdo	.
And	you	 bare 	 ly 	 	might	be	able	to	make	out	 th 	 is 	 	hut	here	.
 Th 	 is 	 	hut	was	built	by	 Ro 	 bert 	 	Falcon	Scott	and	his	men	when	they	first	came	to	 Antarctic 	 a 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	first	 exp 	 ed 	 ition 	 	to	go	to	the	South	 Pol 	 e 	 	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	it	's	so	cold	,	the	entire	 content 	 s 	 	of	that	hut	is	still	 a 	 s 	 	they	left	it	,	with	the	 remnant 	 s 	 	of	the	last	meal	they	 cook 	 ed 	 	still	there	.
It	's	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	place	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	McMurdo	 it 	 self 	 	.	 Ab 	 out 	 	a	thousand	people	work	here	in	summer	,	and	about	200	in	winter	when	it	's	 complete 	 ly 	 	dark	for	six	 month 	 s 	 	.
I	was	here	to	see	the	launch	of	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	type	of	instrument	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	 cosm 	 ic 	 	ray	experiment	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 launch 	 ed 	 	all	the	way	to	the	 upper 	 - 	 strato 	 sphere 	 	to	an	altitude	of	40	km	.
What	I	want	you	to	imagine	is	 th 	 is 	 	is	two	 ton 	 s 	 	in	weight	.
So	you	're	using	a	balloon	to	carry	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	two	 ton 	 s 	 	all	the	way	to	an	altitude	of	40	km	.
And	the	 engineer 	 s 	 	,	the	 technician 	 s 	 	,	the	 physicist 	 s 	 	have	all	got	to	assemble	on	the	Ross	Ice	 She 	 lf 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 Antarctic 	 a 	 	--	I	wo	n't	go	 in 	 to 	 	the	 reason 	 s 	 	why	--	but	it	's	one	of	the	most	 favor 	 able 	 	 place 	 s 	 	for	 do 	 ing 	 	these	balloon	 launch 	 es 	 	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	for	the	weather	.
The	weather	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	imagine	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	summer	,	and	you	're	 stand 	 ing 	 	on	200	ft	of	ice	.
And	there	's	a	 volcan 	 o 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 glaci 	 ers 	 	at	the	 ver 	 y 	 	top	.
And	what	they	have	to	do	is	they	have	to	assemble	the	entire	balloon	--	the	fabric	,	 parachut 	 e 	 	and	 every 	 thing 	 	--	on	the	ice	and	then	fill	it	up	with	 hel 	 ium 	 	.
And	that	process	 take 	 s 	 	about	two	 hour 	 s 	 	.
And	the	weather	can	change	 a 	 s 	 	they	're	 put 	 ting 	 	together	 th 	 is 	 	whole	 assem 	 bly 	 	.
For	 in 	 stance 	 	,	here	they	are	 lay 	 ing 	 	down	the	balloon	fabric	 be 	 hind 	 	,	which	is	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	going	to	be	 fill 	 ed 	 	up	with	 hel 	 ium 	 	.
 T 	 hose 	 	two	 truck 	 s 	 	you	see	at	the	 ver 	 y 	 	end	carry	12	 tank 	 s 	 	each	of	 compress 	 ed 	 	 hel 	 ium 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	in	case	the	weather	 change 	 s 	 	before	the	launch	,	they	have	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	pack	 every 	 thing 	 	back	up	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	boxes	and	take	it	out	back	to	McMurdo	 St 	 ation 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	balloon	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	launch	two	 ton 	 s 	 	of	weight	,	is	an	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	huge	balloon	.
The	fabric	 al 	 one 	 	 weigh 	 s 	 	two	 ton 	 s 	 	.
In	order	to	 minim 	 ize 	 	the	weight	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	thin	,	it	's	 a 	 s 	 	thin	 a 	 s 	 	a	sandwich	 wrap 	 per 	 	.
And	if	they	have	to	pack	it	back	,	they	have	to	put	it	 in 	 to 	 	boxes	and	stamp	on	it	so	that	it	 fit 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	box	 aga 	 in 	 	--	 ex 	 cept 	 	,	when	they	did	it	first	,	it	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	 d 	 one 	 	in	Texas	.
 He 	 re 	 	,	they	ca	n't	do	it	with	the	kind	 shoe 	 s 	 	they	're	 wear 	 ing 	 	,	so	they	have	to	take	 the 	 ir 	 	 shoe 	 s 	 	off	,	get	 bare 	 foot 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	boxes	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	cold	,	and	do	that	kind	of	work	.
That	's	the	kind	of	 d 	 ed 	 ic 	 ation 	 	these	people	have	.
 He 	 re 	 	's	the	balloon	 be 	 ing 	 	 fill 	 ed 	 	up	with	 hel 	 ium 	 	,	and	you	can	see	it	's	a	 gorge 	 ous 	 	sight	.
 He 	 re 	 	's	a	scene	that	 show 	 s 	 	you	the	balloon	and	the	 pay 	 load 	 	 end 	 - 	 to 	 - 	 end 	 	.
So	the	balloon	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 fill 	 ed 	 	up	with	 hel 	 ium 	 	on	the	 left 	 - 	 hand 	 	side	,	and	the	fabric	 actual 	 ly 	 	 run 	 s 	 	all	the	way	to	the	middle	where	there	's	a	piece	of	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	and	 explosive 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	a	 parachut 	 e 	 	,	and	then	the	 parachut 	 e 	 	is	then	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	the	 pay 	 load 	 	.
And	remember	,	all	 th 	 is 	 	wiring	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 d 	 one 	 	by	people	in	 extrem 	 e 	 	cold	,	in	 sub 	 - 	 zero 	 	 temperature 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	 wear 	 ing 	 	about	15	 k 	 g 	 	of	 cloth 	 ing 	 	and	stuff	,	but	they	have	to	take	 the 	 ir 	 	 glove 	 s 	 	off	in	order	to	do	that	.
And	I	would	like	to	share	with	you	a	launch	.
Radio	:	 Oka 	 y 	 	,	 re 	 lease 	 	the	balloon	,	 re 	 lease 	 	the	balloon	,	 re 	 lease 	 	the	balloon	.
 An 	 il 	 	 Ana 	 nthaswamy 	 	:	And	I	'll	 final 	 ly 	 	like	to	 leav 	 e 	 	you	with	two	 image 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	an	 observ 	 atory 	 	in	the	 Himalaya 	 s 	 	,	in	 Lad 	 a 	 kh 	 	in	India	.
And	the	thing	I	want	you	to	look	at	here	is	the	 tele 	 scope 	 	on	the	 right 	 - 	 hand 	 	side	.
And	on	the	far	left	there	is	a	400	 year 	 - 	 old 	 	Buddhist	 mon 	 aste 	 ry 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	 close 	 - 	 up 	 	of	the	Buddhist	 mon 	 aste 	 ry 	 	.
And	I	was	 s 	 truck 	 	by	the	 juxta 	 position 	 	of	these	two	enormous	 discipline 	 s 	 	that	 human 	 ity 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	.
One	is	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	the	 cosmo 	 s 	 	on	the	 out 	 side 	 	,	and	the	other	one	is	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	our	 in 	 terior 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	.
And	both	 requir 	 e 	 	silence	of	some	sort	.
And	what	 s 	 truck 	 	me	was	every	place	that	I	went	to	to	see	these	 tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	,	the	 astronomer 	 s 	 	and	 cosmo 	 logists 	 	are	in	search	of	a	certain	kind	of	silence	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	silence	from	radio	 poll 	 ution 	 	or	light	 poll 	 ution 	 	or	 what 	 ever 	 	.
And	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	obvious	that	,	if	we	destroy	these	silent	 place 	 s 	 	on	Earth	,	we	will	be	 s 	 tuck 	 	on	a	planet	 with 	 out 	 	the	ability	to	look	 out 	 ward 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	will	not	be	able	to	understand	the	 signal 	 s 	 	that	come	from	 out 	 er 	 	space	.
Thank	you	.
I	love	a	 challeng 	 e 	 	,	and	saving	the	Earth	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	a	good	one	.
We	all	know	the	Earth	is	in	trouble	.
We	have	now	 enter 	 ed 	 	in	the	6X	,	the	sixth	major	 extinct 	 ion 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	.
I	often	 wonder 	 ed 	 	,	if	there	was	a	 Unit 	 ed 	 	 Organ 	 ization 	 	of	 Organ 	 ism 	 s 	 	--	 other 	 wise 	 	known	 a 	 s 	 	``	 Uh 	 - 	 Oh 	 	''	--	--	and	every	organism	had	a	right	to	vote	,	would	we	be	 vot 	 ed 	 	on	the	planet	,	or	off	the	planet	?
I	think	that	vote	is	 occur 	 ring 	 	right	now	.
I	want	to	present	to	you	a	 suit 	 e 	 	of	six	 myco 	 logical 	 	 solution 	 s 	 	,	using	fungi	,	and	these	 solution 	 s 	 	are	based	on	 mycel 	 ium 	 	.
The	 mycel 	 ium 	 	 in 	 fuse 	 s 	 	all	 land 	 scapes 	 	,	it	 hold 	 s 	 	 s 	 oil 	 s 	 	together	,	it	's	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 ten 	 acious 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 hold 	 s 	 	up	to	30,000	 time 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	mass	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	the	grand	 mole 	 cular 	 	 dis 	 assemble 	 rs 	 	of	nature	--	the	 s 	 oil 	 	 magic 	 ians 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	generate	the	 hum 	 us 	 	 s 	 oil 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 land 	 masse 	 s 	 	of	Earth	.
We	have	now	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	there	is	a	 multi 	 - 	 direction 	 al 	 	transfer	of	 nutrient 	 s 	 	between	 plant 	 s 	 	,	 mitig 	 ated 	 	by	the	 mcyel 	 ium 	 	--	so	the	 mycel 	 ium 	 	is	the	mother	that	is	giving	 nutrient 	 s 	 	from	 al 	 der 	 	and	 bi 	 rch 	 	 tree 	 s 	 	to	 hem 	 lock 	 s 	 	,	 cedar 	 s 	 	and	Douglas	 fir 	 s 	 	.
 Dust 	 y 	 	and	I	,	we	like	to	say	,	on	 Sun 	 day 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	we	go	to	church	.
I	'm	in	love	with	the	 old 	 - 	 growth 	 	forest	,	and	I	'm	a	 patriot 	 ic 	 	American	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	 t 	 hose 	 	.
 Mo 	 st 	 	of	you	are	familiar	with	 Porto 	 bell 	 o 	 	 mushroom 	 s 	 	.
And	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	I	face	a	big	obstacle	.
When	I	 ment 	 ion 	 	 mushroom 	 s 	 	to	 some 	 body 	 	,	they	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	think	 Porto 	 bell 	 os 	 	or	magic	 mushroom 	 s 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	 glaz 	 e 	 	over	,	and	they	think	I	'm	a	little	crazy	.
So	,	I	hope	to	 pierc 	 e 	 	that	prejudice	 fore 	 ver 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	group	.
We	call	it	 myco 	 phobia 	 	,	the	irrational	fear	of	the	 un 	 known 	 	,	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	fungi	.
 Mushroom 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	fast	in	 the 	 ir 	 	growth	.
Day	21	,	day	23	,	day	25	.
 Mushroom 	 s 	 	produce	strong	 anti 	 biotic 	 s 	 	.
In	fact	,	we	're	more	 close 	 ly 	 	related	to	fungi	than	we	are	to	any	other	 king 	 dom 	 	.
A	group	of	20	 eukary 	 otic 	 	 micro 	 biologist 	 s 	 	 publish 	 ed 	 	a	paper	two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	 erect 	 ing 	 	opisthokonta	--	a	 super 	 - 	 king 	 dom 	 	that	 join 	 s 	 	 animal 	 ia 	 	and	fungi	together	.
We	share	in	common	the	same	 pathogen 	 s 	 	.
 F 	 un 	 gi 	 	do	n't	like	to	rot	from	bacteria	,	and	so	our	best	 anti 	 biotic 	 s 	 	come	from	fungi	.
But	here	is	a	mushroom	that	's	past	 it 	 s 	 	prime	.
After	they	 sporulat 	 e 	 	,	they	do	rot	.
But	I	 pro 	 pose 	 	to	you	that	the	sequence	of	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	that	occur	on	 rot 	 ting 	 	 mushroom 	 s 	 	are	essential	for	the	health	of	the	forest	.
 The 	 y 	 	give	rise	to	the	 tree 	 s 	 	,	they	create	the	 deb 	 ris 	 	 field 	 s 	 	that	feed	the	 mycel 	 ium 	 	.
And	so	we	see	a	mushroom	here	 sporulat 	 ing 	 	.
And	the	 s 	 pore 	 s 	 	are	 germ 	 in 	 ating 	 	,	and	the	 mycel 	 ium 	 	 form 	 s 	 	and	 go 	 es 	 	 under 	 ground 	 	.
In	a	single	cubic	inch	of	 s 	 oil 	 	,	there	can	be	more	than	eight	 mile 	 s 	 	of	these	 cell 	 s 	 	.
My	foot	is	 cover 	 ing 	 	 approximate 	 ly 	 	300	 mile 	 s 	 	of	 mycel 	 ium 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 photo 	 micro 	 graph 	 s 	 	from	Nick	Read	and	 Pa 	 trick 	 	 Hic 	 key 	 	.
And	notice	that	 a 	 s 	 	the	 mycel 	 ium 	 	 grow 	 s 	 	,	it	 conquer 	 s 	 	 territ 	 ory 	 	and	then	it	 begin 	 s 	 	the	net	.
I	've	 be 	 en 	 	a	 s 	 canning 	 	electron	 micro 	 scopist 	 	for	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	,	I	have	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	electron	 micro 	 graph 	 s 	 	,	and	when	I	'm	 star 	 ing 	 	at	the	 mycel 	 ium 	 	,	I	 real 	 ize 	 	that	they	are	 micro 	 filtration 	 	 membrane 	 s 	 	.
We	 exhal 	 e 	 	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	,	so	 do 	 es 	 	 mycel 	 ium 	 	.
It	 inhal 	 es 	 	oxygen	,	just	like	we	do	.
But	these	are	 essential 	 ly 	 	 external 	 ized 	 	 stomach 	 s 	 	and	 lung 	 s 	 	.
And	I	present	to	you	a	 con 	 cept 	 	that	these	are	 extend 	 ed 	 	 neuro 	 logical 	 	 membrane 	 s 	 	.
And	in	these	 cav 	 ities 	 	,	these	 micro 	 - 	 cav 	 ities 	 	form	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	they	fuse	 s 	 oil 	 s 	 	,	they	absorb	water	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	little	 well 	 s 	 	.
And	 in 	 side 	 	these	 well 	 s 	 	,	then	 micro 	 bi 	 al 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	begin	to	form	.
And	so	the	spongy	 s 	 oil 	 	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 resist 	 s 	 	 ero 	 s 	 ion 	 	,	but	 set 	 s 	 	up	a	 micro 	 bi 	 al 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 	that	 give 	 s 	 	rise	to	a	 plural 	 ity 	 	of	other	 organism 	 s 	 	.
I	first	 pro 	 posed 	 	,	in	the	early	1990s	,	that	 mycel 	 ium 	 	is	Earth	's	natural	Internet	.
When	you	look	at	the	 mycel 	 ium 	 	,	they	're	 high 	 ly 	 	 branch 	 ed 	 	.
And	if	there	's	one	branch	that	is	broken	,	then	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 nod 	 es 	 	of	 cross 	 ing 	 	--	Internet	 engineer 	 s 	 	 may 	 be 	 	call	them	hot	 point 	 s 	 	--	there	are	 alter 	 native 	 	 path 	 ways 	 	for	 channel 	 ing 	 	 nutrient 	 s 	 	and	information	.
The	 mycel 	 ium 	 	is	 senti 	 ent 	 	.
It	 know 	 s 	 	that	you	are	there	.
When	you	walk	 a 	 cross 	 	 land 	 scapes 	 	,	it	 leap 	 s 	 	up	in	the	 after 	 math 	 	of	your	 foot 	 step 	 s 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	grab	 deb 	 ris 	 	.
So	,	I	 believ 	 e 	 	the	 invent 	 ion 	 	of	the	computer	Internet	is	an	 inevit 	 able 	 	 con 	 sequence 	 	of	a	 previous 	 ly 	 	proven	,	 bio 	 logically 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	model	.
The	Earth	 invent 	 ed 	 	the	computer	Internet	for	 it 	 s 	 	own	benefit	,	and	we	now	,	 be 	 ing 	 	the	top	organism	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	,	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 al 	 locate 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	in	order	to	protect	the	 bio 	 sphere 	 	.
 Go 	 ing 	 	way	out	,	dark	matter	 conform 	 s 	 	to	the	same	 mycel 	 ial 	 	 arche 	 type 	 	.
I	 believ 	 e 	 	matter	 be 	 get 	 s 	 	life	;	life	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	single	 cell 	 s 	 	;	single	 cell 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 string 	 s 	 	;	 string 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 chain 	 s 	 	;	 chain 	 s 	 	network	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	paradigm	that	we	see	 through 	 out 	 	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
 Mo 	 st 	 	of	you	may	not	know	that	fungi	 we 	 re 	 	the	first	 organism 	 s 	 	to	come	to	land	.
 The 	 y 	 	came	to	land	1.3	billion	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	 plant 	 s 	 	 follow 	 ed 	 	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	hundred	million	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	.
How	is	that	possible	?
It	's	possible	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 mycel 	 ium 	 	 produce 	 s 	 	 oxal 	 ic 	 	 acid 	 s 	 	,	and	 man 	 y 	 	other	 acid 	 s 	 	and	 enzyme 	 s 	 	,	 pock 	 mark 	 ing 	 	rock	and	 grab 	 bing 	 	 calc 	 ium 	 	and	other	 mineral 	 s 	 	and	 form 	 ing 	 	 calc 	 ium 	 	 oxal 	 ates 	 	.
 Make 	 s 	 	the	 rock 	 s 	 	 crumb 	 le 	 	,	and	the	first	step	in	the	generation	of	 s 	 oil 	 	.
Oxalic	acid	is	two	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	 molecule 	 s 	 	 join 	 ed 	 	together	.
So	,	fungi	and	 mycel 	 ium 	 	 sequest 	 er 	 	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	in	the	form	of	 calc 	 ium 	 	 oxal 	 ates 	 	.
And	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	other	 oxal 	 ates 	 	are	 al 	 so 	 	 sequest 	 er 	 ing 	 	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	through	the	 mineral 	 s 	 	that	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 form 	 ed 	 	and	taken	out	of	the	rock	 m 	 atrix 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	was	first	 discover 	 ed 	 	in	1859	.

420	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 th 	 is 	 	organism	 exist 	 ed 	 	.
It	was	 call 	 ed 	 	 Pro 	 to 	 tax 	 ites 	 	.
 Pro 	 to 	 tax 	 ites 	 	,	 lay 	 ing 	 	down	,	was	about	three	feet	tall	.
The	 tall 	 est 	 	 plant 	 s 	 	on	Earth	at	that	time	 we 	 re 	 	less	than	two	feet	.
 Dr 	 . 	 	 Boy 	 ce 	 	,	at	the	 Univers 	 ity 	 	of	 Chi 	 cago 	 	,	 publish 	 ed 	 	an	article	in	the	Journal	of	 Geo 	 logy 	 	 th 	 is 	 	past	year	 determi 	 ning 	 	that	 Pro 	 to 	 tax 	 ites 	 	was	a	giant	fungus	,	a	giant	mushroom	.
 A 	 cross 	 	the	 land 	 scapes 	 	of	Earth	 we 	 re 	 	 dot 	 ted 	 	these	giant	 mushroom 	 s 	 	.
All	 a 	 cross 	 	most	land	 masse 	 s 	 	.
And	these	 exist 	 ed 	 	for	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	we	've	had	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 extinct 	 ion 	 	 event 	 s 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	we	march	forward	--	65	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	--	most	of	you	know	about	it	--	we	had	an	 a 	 steroid 	 	impact	.
The	Earth	was	 s 	 truck 	 	by	an	 a 	 steroid 	 	,	a	huge	amount	of	 deb 	 ris 	 	was	 jettison 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	atmosphere	.
 Sun 	 light 	 	was	cut	off	,	and	fungi	 inherit 	 ed 	 	the	Earth	.
 T 	 hose 	 	 organism 	 s 	 	that	 pair 	 ed 	 	with	fungi	 we 	 re 	 	 reward 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	fungi	do	not	need	light	.
 Mo 	 re 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	at	Einstein	 Univers 	 ity 	 	,	they	just	 determine 	 d 	 	that	fungi	use	 radi 	 ation 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	source	of	energy	,	much	like	 plant 	 s 	 	use	light	.
So	,	the	prospect	of	fungi	 exist 	 ing 	 	on	other	 planet 	 s 	 	 else 	 where 	 	,	I	think	,	is	a	 for 	 gone 	 	 con 	 clusion 	 	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	in	my	own	mind	.
The	largest	organism	in	the	world	is	in	 East 	 ern 	 	Oregon	.
I	could	n't	 mis 	 s 	 	it	.	It	was	2,200	 acre 	 s 	 	in	 s 	 ize 	 	:	2,200	 acre 	 s 	 	in	 s 	 ize 	 	,	2,000	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
The	largest	organism	on	the	planet	is	a	 mycel 	 ial 	 	mat	,	one	cell	wall	thick	.
How	is	it	that	 th 	 is 	 	organism	can	be	so	large	,	and	yet	be	one	cell	wall	thick	,	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	we	have	five	or	six	skin	 layer 	 s 	 	that	protect	us	?
The	 mycel 	 ium 	 	,	in	the	right	 condition 	 s 	 	,	 produce 	 s 	 	a	mushroom	--	it	 burst 	 s 	 	through	with	 s 	 uch 	 	 fer 	 o 	 city 	 	that	it	can	break	asphalt	.
We	 we 	 re 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	with	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 experiment 	 s 	 	.
I	'm	going	to	show	you	six	,	if	I	can	,	 solution 	 s 	 	for	 help 	 ing 	 	to	 s 	 ave 	 	the	world	.
 Bat 	 tell 	 e 	 	 Labor 	 ator 	 ies 	 	and	I	 join 	 ed 	 	up	in	 Bell 	 ing 	 ham 	 	,	 Wash 	 ington 	 	.
There	 we 	 re 	 	four	 pile 	 s 	 	 saturate 	 d 	 	with	 dies 	 el 	 	and	other	petroleum	waste	:	one	was	a	control	pile	;	one	pile	was	 treat 	 ed 	 	with	 enzyme 	 s 	 	;	one	pile	was	 treat 	 ed 	 	with	bacteria	;	and	our	pile	we	 inocul 	 ated 	 	with	mushroom	 mycel 	 ium 	 	.
The	 mycel 	 ium 	 	 absorb 	 s 	 	the	oil	.
The	 mycel 	 ium 	 	is	producing	 enzyme 	 s 	 	--	 per 	 oxid 	 ase 	 s 	 	--	that	break	 carbon 	 - 	 hydrogen 	 	 bond 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	the	same	 bond 	 s 	 	that	hold	 hydro 	 carbon 	 s 	 	together	.
So	,	the	 mycel 	 ium 	 	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 saturate 	 d 	 	with	the	oil	,	and	then	,	when	we	 return 	 ed 	 	six	 week 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	all	the	 tarp 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	,	all	the	other	 pile 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	dead	,	dark	and	 stink 	 y 	 	.
We	came	back	to	our	pile	,	it	was	 cover 	 ed 	 	with	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 pound 	 s 	 	of	oyster	 mushroom 	 s 	 	,	and	the	color	 change 	 d 	 	to	a	light	form	.
The	 enzyme 	 s 	 	 re 	 manufactur 	 ed 	 	the	 hydro 	 carbon 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 carbohydrate 	 s 	 	--	 f 	 ung 	 al 	 	 sugar 	 s 	 	.
Some	of	these	 mushroom 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	happy	 mushroom 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	 ver 	 y 	 	large	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	 show 	 ing 	 	how	much	nutrition	that	they	could	've	 obtain 	 ed 	 	.
But	 some 	 thing 	 	else	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	which	was	an	 epiph 	 any 	 	in	my	life	.
 The 	 y 	 	 sporulat 	 ed 	 	,	the	 s 	 pore 	 s 	 	attract	 insect 	 s 	 	,	the	 insect 	 s 	 	laid	 egg 	 s 	 	,	 egg 	 s 	 	 be 	 came 	 	 larva 	 e 	 	.
 Bird 	 s 	 	then	came	,	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	in	 seed 	 s 	 	,	and	our	pile	 be 	 came 	 	an	 oa 	 sis 	 	of	life	.
 Where 	 a 	 s 	 	the	other	three	 pile 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	dead	,	dark	and	 stink 	 y 	 	,	and	the	 PA 	 H 	 	's	--	the	 aroma 	 tic 	 	 hydro 	 carbon 	 s 	 	--	went	from	10,000	 part 	 s 	 	per	million	to	less	than	200	in	eight	 week 	 s 	 	.
The	last	image	we	do	n't	have	.
The	entire	pile	was	a	green	berm	of	life	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	 gate 	 way 	 	species	,	 van 	 guard 	 	species	that	open	the	door	for	other	 bio 	 logical 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	.
So	I	 invent 	 ed 	 	 bur 	 lap 	 	 s 	 ack 	 s 	 	,	 bunk 	 er 	 	spawn	--	and	 put 	 ting 	 	the	 mycel 	 ium 	 	--	using	storm	blown	 deb 	 ris 	 	,	you	can	take	these	 bur 	 lap 	 	 s 	 ack 	 s 	 	and	put	them	 down 	 stream 	 	from	a	farm	that	's	producing	E.	coli	,	or	other	 waste 	 s 	 	,	or	a	 factor 	 y 	 	with	chemical	 toxin 	 s 	 	,	and	it	 lead 	 s 	 	to	 habit 	 at 	 	 resto 	 ration 	 	.
So	,	we	set	up	a	 s 	 ite 	 	in	 Ma 	 son 	 	 Count 	 y 	 	,	 Wash 	 ington 	 	,	and	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	a	 dramat 	 ic 	 	 de 	 crease 	 	in	the	amount	of	 coli 	 form 	 s 	 	.
And	I	'll	show	you	a	graph	here	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	 log 	 arithmic 	 	scale	,	10	to	the	eighth	power	.
There	's	more	than	a	100	million	 colon 	 ies 	 	per	gram	,	and	10	to	the	third	power	is	around	1,000	.
In	48	 hour 	 s 	 	to	72	 hour 	 s 	 	,	these	three	mushroom	species	 reduc 	 ed 	 	the	amount	of	 coli 	 form 	 	bacteria	10,000	 time 	 s 	 	.
Think	of	the	 implic 	 ations 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	 space 	 - 	 conserv 	 ative 	 	method	that	uses	storm	 deb 	 ris 	 	--	and	we	can	guarantee	that	we	will	have	 storm 	 s 	 	every	year	.
So	,	 th 	 is 	 	one	mushroom	,	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	drawn	our	interest	over	time	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	my	wife	 Dust 	 y 	 	,	with	a	mushroom	 call 	 ed 	 	Fomitopsis	 off 	 icinalis 	 	--	 Aga 	 rikon 	 	.
It	's	a	mushroom	exclusive	to	the	 old 	 - 	 growth 	 	forest	that	 Diosco 	 ride 	 s 	 	first	 de 	 scribed 	 	in	65	 A. 	 D 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	 treat 	 ment 	 	against	consumption	.
 Th 	 is 	 	mushroom	 grow 	 s 	 	in	 Wash 	 ington 	 	 Stat 	 e 	 	,	Oregon	,	 north 	 ern 	 	California	,	 Brit 	 ish 	 	Columbia	,	now	thought	to	be	extinct	in	 Euro 	 pe 	 	.
May	not	seem	that	large	--	let	's	get	 close 	 r 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	rare	fungus	.
Our	team	--	and	we	have	a	team	of	 expert 	 s 	 	that	go	out	--	we	went	out	20	 time 	 s 	 	in	the	 old 	 - 	 growth 	 	forest	last	year	.
We	found	one	 s 	 ample 	 	to	be	able	to	get	 in 	 to 	 	culture	.
 Pre 	 serv 	 ing 	 	the	genome	of	these	fungi	in	the	 old 	 - 	 growth 	 	forest	I	think	is	 absolute 	 ly 	 	critical	for	human	health	.
I	've	 be 	 en 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	with	the	U.S.	 Defe 	 ns 	 e 	 	Department	 Bio 	 Shield 	 	program	.
We	 submit 	 ted 	 	over	300	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	 mushroom 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 boil 	 ed 	 	in	hot	water	,	and	 mycel 	 ium 	 	 harvest 	 ing 	 	these	 extra 	 cellular 	 	 metabol 	 ites 	 	.
And	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	we	 receiv 	 ed 	 	these	 result 	 s 	 	.
We	have	three	different	 s 	 train 	 s 	 	of	 Aga 	 rikon 	 	 mushroom 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 high 	 ly 	 	active	against	 pox 	 viruses 	 	.
 Dr 	 . 	 	 Ear 	 l 	 	 Ker 	 n 	 	,	who	's	a	 small 	 pox 	 	expert	of	the	U.S.	 Defe 	 ns 	 e 	 	Department	,	 state 	 s 	 	that	any	 com 	 pound 	 s 	 	that	have	a	 select 	 ivity 	 	index	of	two	or	more	are	active	.
10	or	 great 	 er 	 	are	 consider 	 ed 	 	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	active	.
Our	mushroom	 s 	 train 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	in	the	 high 	 ly 	 	active	range	.
There	's	a	 vet 	 ted 	 	press	 re 	 lease 	 	that	you	can	read	--	it	's	 vet 	 ted 	 	by	 DO 	 D 	 	--	if	you	Google	``	Stamets	''	and	``	 small 	 pox 	 	.	''
Or	you	can	go	to	 N 	 PR 	 .org 	 	and	listen	to	a	live	interview	.
So	,	 encourag 	 ed 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	,	 natural 	 ly 	 	we	went	to	flu	viruses	.
And	so	,	for	the	first	time	,	I	am	 show 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
We	have	three	different	 s 	 train 	 s 	 	of	 Aga 	 rikon 	 	 mushroom 	 s 	 	 high 	 ly 	 	active	against	flu	viruses	.
 He 	 re 	 	's	the	 select 	 ivity 	 	index	 number 	 s 	 	--	against	pox	,	you	saw	10s	and	20s	--	now	against	flu	viruses	,	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	the	ribavirin	 control 	 s 	 	,	we	have	an	 extra 	 ordinari 	 ly 	 	high	activity	.
And	we	're	using	a	natural	 ex 	 tract 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	same	 do 	 s 	 age 	 	window	 a 	 s 	 	a	 pur 	 e 	 	pharmaceutical	.
We	 tri 	 ed 	 	it	against	flu	A	viruses	--	 H1N 	 1 	 	,	 H3N 	 2 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	flu	B	viruses	.
So	then	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	a	blend	,	and	in	a	blend	combination	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	it	against	 H5N 	 1 	 	,	and	we	got	 great 	 er 	 	than	1,000	 select 	 ivity 	 	index	.
I	then	think	that	we	can	make	the	argument	that	we	should	 s 	 ave 	 	the	 old 	 - 	 growth 	 	forest	 a 	 s 	 	a	matter	of	national	defense	.
I	 be 	 came 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 entomo 	 pathogen 	 ic 	 	fungi	--	fungi	that	kill	 insect 	 s 	 	.
Our	house	was	 be 	 ing 	 	 destroy 	 ed 	 	by	 carp 	 enter 	 	ants	.
So	,	I	went	to	the	 E 	 PA 	 	 home 	 page 	 	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 recommend 	 ing 	 	 stud 	 ies 	 	with	 meta 	 rhiz 	 ium 	 	species	of	a	group	of	fungi	that	kill	 carp 	 enter 	 	ants	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	 term 	 ites 	 	.
I	did	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 no 	 body 	 	else	had	 d 	 one 	 	.
I	 actual 	 ly 	 	 chase 	 d 	 	the	 mycel 	 ium 	 	,	when	it	 stop 	 ped 	 	producing	 s 	 pore 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	 s 	 pore 	 s 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 s 	 pore 	 s 	 	.
I	was	able	to	morph	the	culture	 in 	 to 	 	a	 non 	 - 	 sporulat 	 ing 	 	form	.
And	so	the	industry	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 pent 	 	over	100	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	 specific 	 ally 	 	on	bait	 station 	 s 	 	to	prevent	 term 	 ites 	 	from	eating	your	house	.
But	the	 insect 	 s 	 	are	n't	stupid	,	and	they	would	avoid	the	 s 	 pore 	 s 	 	when	they	came	close	,	and	so	I	 morph 	 ed 	 	the	 culture 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	 non 	 - 	 sporulat 	 ing 	 	form	.
And	I	got	my	daughter	's	Barbie	doll	dish	,	I	put	it	right	where	a	bunch	of	 carp 	 enter 	 	ants	 we 	 re 	 	making	 deb 	 ris 	 	 field 	 s 	 	,	every	day	,	in	my	house	,	and	the	ants	 we 	 re 	 	 attract 	 ed 	 	to	the	 mycel 	 ium 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	no	 s 	 pore 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	it	to	the	 que 	 en 	 	.
One	week	 lat 	 er 	 	,	I	had	no	 saw 	 dust 	 	 pile 	 s 	 	 what 	 so 	 ever 	 	.
And	then	--	a	 delic 	 ate 	 	dance	between	 d 	 inner 	 	and	death	--	the	 mycel 	 ium 	 	is	 consum 	 ed 	 	by	the	ants	,	they	 be 	 come 	 	 mum 	 m 	 ified 	 	,	and	,	 bo 	 ing 	 	,	a	mushroom	 pop 	 s 	 	out	of	 the 	 ir 	 	head	.
 N 	 ow 	 	after	 sporulat 	 ion 	 	,	the	 s 	 pore 	 s 	 	repel	.
So	,	the	house	is	no	 long 	 er 	 	 suit 	 able 	 	for	invasion	.
So	,	you	have	a	 near 	 - 	 permanent 	 	solution	for	 re 	 invasion 	 	of	 term 	 ites 	 	.
And	so	my	house	came	down	,	I	 receiv 	 ed 	 	my	first	patent	against	 carp 	 enter 	 	ants	,	 term 	 ites 	 	and	fire	ants	.
 Th 	 en 	 	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	 ex 	 tract 	 s 	 	,	and	lo	and	 be 	 hold 	 	,	we	can	steer	 insect 	 s 	 	to	different	 direction 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	huge	 implic 	 ations 	 	.
I	then	 receiv 	 ed 	 	my	second	patent	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	big	one	.
It	's	 be 	 en 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	an	 Alexa 	 nder 	 	 Gra 	 ham 	 	Bell	patent	.
It	 cover 	 s 	 	over	200,000	species	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	most	 disrupt 	 ive 	 	technology	--	I	've	 be 	 en 	 	told	by	 ex 	 ecutive 	 s 	 	of	the	 pest 	 icide 	 	industry	--	that	they	have	ever	 witness 	 ed 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	could	 total 	 ly 	 	revamp	the	 pest 	 icide 	 	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	 through 	 out 	 	the	world	.
You	could	fly	100	 Ph.D 	 . 	 	 student 	 s 	 	under	the	 um 	 br 	 ella 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 cept 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	my	 s 	 up 	 position 	 	is	that	 entomo 	 pathogen 	 ic 	 	fungi	,	prior	to	 sporulat 	 ion 	 	,	attract	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 insect 	 s 	 	that	are	 other 	 wise 	 	 repel 	 led 	 	by	 t 	 hose 	 	 s 	 pore 	 s 	 	.
And	so	I	came	up	with	a	Life	Box	,	 be 	 cause 	 	I	 need 	 ed 	 	a	 deliver 	 y 	 	system	.
The	Life	Box	--	you	're	gon	na	be	 get 	 ting 	 	a	DVD	of	the	TED	 con 	 ference 	 	--	you	add	 s 	 oil 	 	,	you	add	water	,	you	have	 myco 	 rrhizal 	 	and	 endo 	 phy 	 tic 	 	fungi	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	 s 	 pore 	 s 	 	,	like	of	the	 Aga 	 rikon 	 	mushroom	.
The	 seed 	 s 	 	then	are	 mother 	 ed 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	 mycel 	 ium 	 	.
And	then	you	put	tree	 seed 	 s 	 	in	here	,	and	then	you	end	up	growing	--	 potential 	 ly 	 	--	an	 old 	 - 	 growth 	 	forest	from	a	 card 	 board 	 	box	.
I	want	to	 re 	 invent 	 	the	 deliver 	 y 	 	system	,	and	the	use	of	 card 	 board 	 	around	the	world	,	so	they	 be 	 come 	 	 eco 	 logical 	 	 foot 	 print 	 s 	 	.
If	there	's	a	 YouTube 	 - 	 like 	 	 s 	 ite 	 	that	you	could	put	up	,	you	could	make	it	 inter 	 active 	 	,	zip	code	specific	--	where	people	could	join	together	,	and	through	satellite	 im 	 aging 	 	 system 	 s 	 	,	through	Virtual	Earth	or	Google	Earth	,	you	could	confirm	carbon	 credit 	 s 	 	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 sequest 	 er 	 ed 	 	by	the	 tree 	 s 	 	that	are	coming	through	Life	 Box 	 es 	 	.
You	could	take	a	 card 	 board 	 	box	 deliver 	 ing 	 	 shoe 	 s 	 	,	you	could	add	water	--	I	 develop 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	for	the	 refuge 	 e 	 	community	--	 corn 	 s 	 	,	 bean 	 s 	 	and	squash	and	 on 	 ions 	 	.
I	took	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 contain 	 ers 	 	--	my	wife	 s 	 aid 	 	,	if	I	could	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	 any 	 body 	 	could	--	and	I	 end 	 ed 	 	up	growing	a	seed	garden	.
 Th 	 en 	 	you	harvest	the	 seed 	 s 	 	--	and	thank	you	,	 Er 	 ic 	 	 Ra 	 smussen 	 	,	for	your	help	on	 th 	 is 	 	--	and	then	you	're	 harvest 	 ing 	 	the	seed	garden	.
 Th 	 en 	 	you	can	harvest	the	 ker 	 nel 	 s 	 	,	and	then	you	just	need	a	few	 ker 	 nel 	 s 	 	.
I	add	 mycel 	 ium 	 	to	it	,	and	then	I	 inocul 	 ate 	 	the	 corn 	 cob 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	three	 corn 	 cob 	 s 	 	,	no	other	grain	--	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 mushroom 	 s 	 	begin	to	form	.
Too	 man 	 y 	 	 withdraw 	 al 	 s 	 	from	the	carbon	bank	,	and	so	 th 	 is 	 	population	will	be	shut	down	.
But	watch	what	 happen 	 s 	 	here	.
The	 mushroom 	 s 	 	then	are	 harvest 	 ed 	 	,	but	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	the	 mycel 	 ium 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 convert 	 ed 	 	the	 cell 	 u 	 lose 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 f 	 ung 	 al 	 	 sugar 	 s 	 	.
And	so	I	thought	,	how	could	we	address	the	energy	crisis	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	?
And	we	came	up	with	 Eco 	 nol 	 	.
 Gene 	 rating 	 	ethanol	from	 cell 	 u 	 lose 	 	using	 mycel 	 ium 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	 inter 	 media 	 ry 	 	--	and	you	gain	all	the	 benefit 	 s 	 	that	I	've	 de 	 scribed 	 	to	you	 al 	 ready 	 	.
But	to	go	from	 cell 	 u 	 lose 	 	to	ethanol	is	 eco 	 logically 	 	 un 	 intelligent 	 	,	and	I	think	that	we	need	to	be	 eco 	 no 	 logically 	 	intelligent	about	the	generation	of	 fuel 	 s 	 	.
So	,	we	build	the	carbon	 bank 	 s 	 	on	the	planet	,	renew	the	 s 	 oil 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	a	species	that	we	need	to	join	with	.
I	think	 engag 	 ing 	 	 mycel 	 ium 	 	can	help	 s 	 ave 	 	the	world	.
Thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
 Imagin 	 e 	 	,	if	you	will	--	a	gift	.
I	'd	like	for	you	to	picture	it	in	your	mind	.
It	's	not	too	big	--	about	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	a	golf	ball	.
So	envision	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	all	 wrap 	 ped 	 	up	.
But	before	I	show	you	what	's	 in 	 side 	 	,	I	will	tell	you	,	it	's	going	to	do	 in 	 credible 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	for	you	.
It	will	 br 	 ing 	 	all	of	your	family	together	.
You	will	feel	 love 	 d 	 	and	 appreciate 	 d 	 	like	never	before	and	 re 	 connect 	 	with	 friend 	 s 	 	and	 acquaint 	 ance 	 s 	 	you	have	n't	heard	from	in	 year 	 s 	 	.
 Adora 	 tion 	 	and	 admi 	 ration 	 	will	overwhelm	you	.
It	will	 re 	 calibrate 	 	what	's	most	 import 	 ant 	 	in	your	life	.
It	will	 re 	 define 	 	your	sense	of	 spiritual 	 ity 	 	and	faith	.
You	'll	have	a	new	 understand 	 ing 	 	and	trust	in	your	body	.
You	'll	have	 un 	 surpass 	 ed 	 	 vital 	 ity 	 	and	energy	.
You	'll	expand	your	 vocabul 	 ary 	 	,	meet	new	people	,	and	you	'll	have	a	 health 	 ier 	 	 life 	 style 	 	.
And	get	 th 	 is 	 	--	you	'll	have	an	 eight 	 - 	 week 	 	 vac 	 ation 	 	of	 do 	 ing 	 	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
You	'll	eat	 count 	 less 	 	gourmet	 meal 	 s 	 	.
 F 	 lower 	 s 	 	will	 arriv 	 e 	 	by	the	 truck 	 load 	 	.
People	will	say	to	you	,	``	You	look	great	.	 Hav 	 e 	 	you	had	any	work	 d 	 one 	 	?	''
And	you	'll	have	a	 life 	 time 	 	supply	of	good	 drug 	 s 	 	.
You	'll	be	 challeng 	 ed 	 	,	inspired	,	 motiv 	 ated 	 	and	 humble 	 d 	 	.
Your	life	will	have	new	meaning	.
 Pe 	 ace 	 	,	health	,	 s 	 er 	 en 	 ity 	 	,	happiness	,	nirvana	.
The	price	?
$	55,000	,	and	that	's	an	 in 	 credible 	 	deal	.
By	now	I	know	you	're	 dy 	 ing 	 	to	know	what	it	is	and	where	you	can	get	one	.
 Do 	 es 	 	Amazon	carry	it	?
 Do 	 es 	 	it	have	the	Apple	logo	on	it	?
 I 	 s 	 	there	a	 wait 	 ing 	 	list	?
Not	 like 	 ly 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	gift	came	to	me	about	five	 month 	 s 	 	ago	.
It	 look 	 ed 	 	more	like	 th 	 is 	 	when	it	was	all	 wrap 	 ped 	 	up	--	not	 quit 	 e 	 	so	 pre 	 tty 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	then	 th 	 is 	 	.
It	was	a	rare	gem	--	a	brain	tumor	,	hemangioblastoma	--	the	gift	that	 keep 	 s 	 	on	giving	.
And	while	I	'm	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	now	,	I	would	n't	wish	 th 	 is 	 	gift	for	you	.
I	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	you	'd	want	it	.
But	I	would	n't	change	my	experience	.
It	 pro 	 found 	 ly 	 	 alter 	 ed 	 	my	life	in	ways	I	did	n't	expect	in	all	the	ways	I	just	 share 	 d 	 	with	you	.
So	the	next	time	you	're	 face 	 d 	 	with	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	,	 un 	 want 	 ed 	 	and	 un 	 certain 	 	,	consider	that	it	just	may	be	a	gift	.
I	have	had	the	distinct	pleasure	of	living	 in 	 side 	 	two	 bio 	 sphere 	 s 	 	.
Of	course	we	all	here	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	live	in	 Bio 	 sphere 	 	1	.
I	've	 al 	 so 	 	lived	in	 Bio 	 sphere 	 	2	.
And	the	 wonder 	 ful 	 	thing	about	that	is	that	I	get	to	 compar 	 e 	 	 bio 	 sphere 	 s 	 	.
And	 hope 	 fully 	 	from	that	I	get	to	learn	 some 	 thing 	 	.
So	what	did	I	learn	?	Well	,	here	I	am	 in 	 side 	 	 Bio 	 sphere 	 	2	,	making	a	pizza	.
So	I	am	 harvest 	 ing 	 	the	wheat	,	in	order	to	make	the	dough	.
And	then	of	course	I	have	to	milk	the	 goat 	 s 	 	and	feed	the	 goat 	 s 	 	in	order	to	make	the	cheese	.
It	took	me	four	 month 	 s 	 	in	 Bio 	 sphere 	 	2	to	make	a	pizza	.
 He 	 re 	 	in	 Bio 	 sphere 	 	1	,	well	it	 take 	 s 	 	me	about	two	 minute 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	I	pick	up	the	phone	and	I	call	and	say	,	``	Hey	,	can	you	deliver	the	pizza	?	''
So	 Bio 	 sphere 	 	2	was	 essential 	 ly 	 	a	 three 	 - 	 acre 	 	,	 entire 	 ly 	 	 seal 	 ed 	 	,	 miniatur 	 e 	 	world	that	I	lived	in	for	two	 year 	 s 	 	and	20	 minute 	 s 	 	.
Over	the	top	it	was	 seal 	 ed 	 	with	steel	and	glass	,	 under 	 neath 	 	it	was	 seal 	 ed 	 	with	a	pan	of	steel	--	 essential 	 ly 	 	 entire 	 ly 	 	 seal 	 ed 	 	.
So	we	had	our	own	 miniatur 	 e 	 	 rain 	 forest 	 	,	a	private	beach	with	a	coral	reef	.
We	had	a	savanna	,	a	marsh	,	a	desert	.
We	had	our	own	 half 	 - 	 acre 	 	farm	that	we	had	to	grow	 every 	 thing 	 	.
And	of	course	we	had	our	human	 habit 	 at 	 	,	where	we	lived	.
Back	in	the	 mid 	 - 	 ' 	 80 	 s 	 	when	we	 we 	 re 	 	 design 	 ing 	 	 Bio 	 sphere 	 	2	,	we	had	to	ask	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	some	 pre 	 tty 	 	 bas 	 ic 	 	 question 	 s 	 	.
I	mean	,	what	is	a	 bio 	 sphere 	 	?
Back	then	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	I	guess	we	all	know	now	that	it	is	 essential 	 ly 	 	the	sphere	of	life	around	the	Earth	,	right	?
Well	,	you	have	to	get	a	little	more	specific	than	that	if	you	're	going	to	build	one	.
And	so	we	 decide 	 d 	 	that	what	it	 re 	 ally 	 	is	is	that	it	is	 entire 	 ly 	 	 material 	 ly 	 	closed	--	that	is	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	 go 	 es 	 	in	or	out	at	all	,	no	material	--	and	 energ 	 et 	 ically 	 	open	,	which	is	 essential 	 ly 	 	what	planet	Earth	is	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	chamber	that	was	1/400th	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	 Bio 	 sphere 	 	2	that	we	 call 	 ed 	 	our	 T 	 est 	 	Module	.
And	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	day	that	 th 	 is 	 	fellow	,	John	 All 	 en 	 	,	 walk 	 ed 	 	in	,	to	 s 	 pend 	 	a	couple	of	 day 	 s 	 	in	there	with	all	the	 plant 	 s 	 	and	 animal 	 s 	 	and	bacteria	that	we	'd	put	in	there	to	 hope 	 fully 	 	keep	him	 al 	 ive 	 	,	the	 doctor 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 concern 	 ed 	 	that	he	was	going	to	succumb	to	some	 dread 	 ful 	 	toxin	,	or	that	his	 lung 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	get	 choke 	 d 	 	with	bacteria	or	 some 	 thing 	 	,	fungus	.
But	of	course	 non 	 e 	 	of	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
And	over	the	 en 	 suing 	 	few	 year 	 s 	 	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	great	 s 	 aga 	 s 	 	about	 design 	 ing 	 	 Bio 	 sphere 	 	2	.
But	by	1991	we	 final 	 ly 	 	had	 th 	 is 	 	thing	built	.
And	it	was	time	for	us	to	go	in	and	give	it	a	go	.
We	 need 	 ed 	 	to	know	,	is	life	 th 	 is 	 	 malle 	 able 	 	?
Can	you	take	 th 	 is 	 	 bio 	 sphere 	 	,	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 evolv 	 ed 	 	on	a	planetary	scale	,	and	jam	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	little	bottle	,	and	will	it	 surviv 	 e 	 	?
Big	 question 	 s 	 	.
And	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	know	 th 	 is 	 	both	for	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	go	 some 	 where 	 	else	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	--	if	we	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	go	to	 Mar 	 s 	 	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	would	we	take	a	 bio 	 sphere 	 	with	us	,	to	live	in	it	?
We	 al 	 so 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	know	so	we	can	understand	more	about	the	Earth	that	we	all	live	in	.
Well	,	in	1991	it	was	 final 	 ly 	 	time	for	us	to	go	in	and	try	out	 th 	 is 	 	baby	.
Let	's	take	it	on	a	maiden	voyage	.
Will	it	work	?	Or	will	 some 	 thing 	 	happen	that	we	ca	n't	understand	and	we	ca	n't	fix	,	 there 	 by 	 	 neg 	 ating 	 	the	 con 	 cept 	 	of	 man 	 - 	 made 	 	 bio 	 sphere 	 s 	 	?
So	eight	of	us	went	in	:	four	men	and	four	women	.
 Mo 	 re 	 	on	that	 lat 	 er 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	world	that	we	lived	in	.
So	,	on	the	top	,	we	had	these	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 rain 	 forest 	 s 	 	and	an	ocean	,	and	 under 	 neath 	 	we	had	all	 th 	 is 	 	 techno 	 sphere 	 	,	we	 call 	 ed 	 	it	,	which	is	where	all	the	 pump 	 s 	 	and	the	 val 	 ves 	 	and	the	water	 tank 	 s 	 	and	the	air	 handler 	 s 	 	,	and	all	of	that	.
One	of	the	 Bio 	 s 	 ph 	 er 	 ians 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	it	``	garden	of	 E 	 den 	 	on	top	of	an	 air 	 craft 	 	 car 	 rier 	 	.	''
And	then	 al 	 so 	 	we	had	the	human	 habit 	 at 	 	of	course	,	with	the	 labor 	 ator 	 ies 	 	,	and	all	of	that	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	 agricultur 	 e 	 	.
It	was	 essential 	 ly 	 	an	 organ 	 ic 	 	farm	.
The	day	I	 walk 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 Bio 	 sphere 	 	2	,	I	was	,	for	the	first	time	,	 breath 	 ing 	 	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	atmosphere	than	 every 	 body 	 	else	in	the	world	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	seven	other	people	.
At	that	moment	I	 be 	 came 	 	part	of	that	 bio 	 sphere 	 	.
And	I	do	n't	mean	that	in	an	abstract	sense	;	I	mean	it	 ra 	 ther 	 	 liter 	 ally 	 	.
When	I	 breath 	 ed 	 	out	,	my	CO2	fed	the	sweet	 potato 	 es 	 	that	I	was	growing	.
And	we	ate	an	awful	lot	of	the	sweet	 potato 	 es 	 	.
And	 t 	 hose 	 	sweet	 potato 	 es 	 	 be 	 came 	 	part	of	me	.
In	fact	,	we	ate	so	 man 	 y 	 	sweet	 potato 	 es 	 	I	 be 	 came 	 	 o 	 range 	 	with	sweet	potato	.
I	 liter 	 ally 	 	was	eating	the	same	carbon	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	.
I	was	eating	 my 	 self 	 	in	some	strange	sort	of	bizarre	way	.
When	it	came	to	our	atmosphere	,	 how 	 ever 	 	,	it	was	n't	that	much	of	a	joke	over	the	long	term	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	oxygen	,	 quit 	 e 	 	a	lot	of	oxygen	.
And	we	 k 	 new 	 	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	CO2	.
And	so	we	 we 	 re 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	to	 sequest 	 er 	 	carbon	.
Good	lord	--	we	know	that	term	now	.
We	 we 	 re 	 	growing	 plant 	 s 	 	like	crazy	.
We	 we 	 re 	 	taking	 the 	 ir 	 	 bio 	 mass 	 	,	storing	them	in	the	 base 	 ment 	 	,	growing	 plant 	 s 	 	,	going	around	,	around	,	around	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	take	all	of	that	carbon	out	of	the	atmosphere	.
We	 we 	 re 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	stop	carbon	from	going	 in 	 to 	 	the	atmosphere	.
We	 stop 	 ped 	 	 irrig 	 ating 	 	our	 s 	 oil 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	we	could	.
We	 stop 	 ped 	 	 till 	 ing 	 	,	so	that	we	could	prevent	 green 	 house 	 	 gas 	 s 	 es 	 	from	going	 in 	 to 	 	the	air	.
But	our	oxygen	was	going	down	 fast 	 er 	 	than	our	CO2	was	going	up	,	which	was	 quit 	 e 	 	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	had	 s 	 een 	 	them	going	in	tandem	in	the	test	 modul 	 e 	 	.
And	it	was	like	 play 	 ing 	 	atomic	 hide 	 - 	 and 	 - 	 seek 	 	.
We	had	lost	seven	 ton 	 s 	 	of	oxygen	.
And	we	had	no	clue	where	it	was	.
And	I	tell	you	,	when	you	lose	a	lot	of	oxygen	--	and	our	oxygen	went	down	 quit 	 e 	 	far	;	it	went	from	21	percent	down	to	14.2	percent	--	my	 good 	 ness 	 	,	do	you	feel	 dread 	 ful 	 	.
I	mean	we	 we 	 re 	 	 drag 	 ging 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	around	the	 Bio 	 sphere 	 	.
And	we	had	sleep	apnea	at	night	.
So	you	'd	wake	up	 gasp 	 ing 	 	with	breath	,	 be 	 cause 	 	your	blood	 chemist 	 ry 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	.
And	that	you	 liter 	 ally 	 	do	that	.	You	stop	 breath 	 ing 	 	and	then	you	--	--	take	a	breath	and	it	 wake 	 s 	 	you	up	.	And	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 irrit 	 ating 	 	.
And	 every 	 body 	 	 out 	 side 	 	thought	we	 we 	 re 	 	 dy 	 ing 	 	.
I	mean	,	the	media	was	making	it	sound	like	 we 	 re 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 dy 	 ing 	 	.
And	I	had	to	call	up	my	mother	every	other	day	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	No	,	Mum	,	it	's	fine	,	fine	.
We	're	not	dead	.	We	're	fine	.	We	're	fine	.	''
And	the	doctor	was	,	in	fact	,	 check 	 ing 	 	us	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	,	in	fact	,	fine	.
But	in	fact	he	was	the	person	who	was	most	susceptible	to	the	oxygen	.
And	one	day	he	could	n't	add	up	a	line	of	 figure 	 s 	 	.
And	it	was	time	for	us	to	put	oxygen	in	.
And	you	might	think	,	well	,	``	Boy	,	your	life	support	system	was	 fail 	 ing 	 	you	.	 Wa 	 s 	 	n't	that	 dread 	 ful 	 	?	''
Yes	.	In	a	sense	it	was	 terrify 	 ing 	 	.
 Ex 	 cept 	 	that	I	 k 	 new 	 	I	could	walk	out	the	 air 	 lock 	 	door	at	any	time	,	if	it	 re 	 ally 	 	got	bad	,	 th 	 ough 	 	who	was	going	to	say	,	``	I	ca	n't	take	it	 any 	 more 	 	!	``	?
Not	me	,	that	was	for	 s 	 ure 	 	.
But	on	the	other	hand	,	it	was	the	scientific	gold	of	the	project	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	could	 re 	 ally 	 	crank	 th 	 is 	 	baby	up	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	scientific	tool	,	and	see	if	we	could	,	in	fact	,	find	where	 t 	 hose 	 	seven	 ton 	 s 	 	of	oxygen	had	gone	.
And	we	did	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	find	it	.
And	we	found	it	in	the	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	.
 Essential 	 ly 	 	it	had	 d 	 one 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	.
We	had	put	too	much	carbon	in	the	 s 	 oil 	 	in	the	form	of	 com 	 post 	 	.
It	broke	down	;	it	took	oxygen	out	of	the	air	;	it	put	CO2	 in 	 to 	 	the	air	;	and	it	went	 in 	 to 	 	the	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	.
 Pre 	 tty 	 	 straight 	 forward 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	.
So	at	the	end	of	the	two	 year 	 s 	 	when	we	came	out	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	 el 	 ated 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	in	fact	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	you	might	say	we	had	 discover 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	was	 quit 	 e 	 	``	 uh 	 h 	 	,	''	when	your	oxygen	is	going	down	,	 stop 	 ped 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	,	 essential 	 ly 	 	,	in	your	life	support	system	,	that	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	bad	failure	.
 Ex 	 cept 	 	that	we	 k 	 new 	 	what	it	was	.	And	we	 k 	 new 	 	how	to	fix	it	.
And	 noth 	 ing 	 	else	 emerge 	 d 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	was	 a 	 s 	 	serious	 a 	 s 	 	that	.
And	we	 prov 	 ed 	 	the	 con 	 cept 	 	,	more	or	less	.
People	,	on	the	other	hand	,	was	a	different	subject	.
We	 we 	 re 	 	--	 yea 	 h 	 	I	do	n't	know	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	 fix 	 able 	 	.
We	all	went	 quit 	 e 	 	nuts	,	I	will	say	.
And	the	day	I	came	out	of	 Bio 	 sphere 	 	2	,	I	was	 thrill 	 ed 	 	I	was	going	to	see	all	my	family	and	my	 friend 	 s 	 	.
For	two	 year 	 s 	 	I	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	people	through	the	glass	.
And	 every 	 body 	 	ran	up	to	me	.
And	I	 re 	 coil 	 ed 	 	.	 The 	 y 	 	 s 	 tank 	 	!
People	stink	!
We	stink	of	 hair 	 spray 	 	and	 under 	 arm 	 	 deodo 	 rant 	 	,	and	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	stuff	.
 N 	 ow 	 	we	had	stuff	 in 	 side 	 	 Bio 	 sphere 	 	to	keep	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	clean	,	but	 noth 	 ing 	 	with	perfume	.
And	boy	do	we	stink	out	here	.
Not	 on 	 ly 	 	that	,	but	I	lost	touch	of	where	my	food	came	from	.
I	had	 be 	 en 	 	growing	all	my	own	food	.
I	had	no	idea	what	was	in	my	food	,	where	it	came	from	.
I	did	n't	even	 recogn 	 ize 	 	half	the	 name 	 s 	 	in	most	of	the	food	that	I	was	eating	.
In	fact	,	I	would	stand	for	 hour 	 s 	 	in	the	 aisle 	 s 	 	of	 shop 	 s 	 	,	 read 	 ing 	 	all	the	 name 	 s 	 	on	all	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	.
People	must	have	thought	I	was	nuts	.
It	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 astonish 	 ing 	 	.
And	I	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	lost	track	of	where	I	was	in	 th 	 is 	 	big	 bio 	 sphere 	 	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	big	 bio 	 sphere 	 	that	we	all	live	in	.
In	 Bio 	 sphere 	 	2	I	 total 	 ly 	 	 under 	 stood 	 	that	I	had	a	huge	impact	on	my	 bio 	 sphere 	 	,	 every 	 day 	 	,	and	it	had	an	impact	on	me	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 visceral 	 ly 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 liter 	 ally 	 	.
So	I	went	about	my	business	:	 Parag 	 on 	 	Space	 Develop 	 ment 	 	 Corp 	 or 	 ation 	 	,	a	little	firm	I	 start 	 ed 	 	with	people	while	I	was	in	the	 Bio 	 sphere 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	I	had	 noth 	 ing 	 	else	to	do	.
And	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	did	was	try	to	figure	out	:	how	small	can	you	make	these	 bio 	 sphere 	 s 	 	,	and	what	can	you	do	with	them	?
And	so	we	 s 	 ent 	 	one	onto	the	Mir	Space	 St 	 ation 	 	.
We	had	one	on	the	shuttle	and	one	on	the	 Inter 	 national 	 	Space	 St 	 ation 	 	,	for	16	 month 	 s 	 	,	where	we	 manage 	 d 	 	to	produce	the	first	 organism 	 s 	 	to	go	through	complete	 multi 	 ple 	 	life	 cycle 	 s 	 	in	space	--	 re 	 ally 	 	 push 	 ing 	 	the	 envelop 	 e 	 	of	 understand 	 ing 	 	how	 malle 	 able 	 	our	life	 system 	 s 	 	are	.
And	I	'm	 al 	 so 	 	proud	to	announce	that	you	're	 get 	 ting 	 	a	sneak	 pre 	 view 	 	--	on	 Frida 	 y 	 	we	're	going	to	announce	that	we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 form 	 ing 	 	a	team	to	develop	a	system	to	grow	 plant 	 s 	 	on	the	 Mo 	 on 	 	,	which	is	going	to	be	 pre 	 tty 	 	 f 	 un 	 	.
And	the	 leg 	 acy 	 	of	that	is	a	system	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	 design 	 ing 	 	:	an	 entire 	 ly 	 	 seal 	 ed 	 	system	to	grow	 plant 	 s 	 	to	grow	on	 Mar 	 s 	 	.
And	part	of	that	is	that	we	had	to	model	 ver 	 y 	 	rapid	 circul 	 ation 	 	of	CO2	and	oxygen	and	water	through	 th 	 is 	 	plant	system	.
 A 	 s 	 	a	result	of	that	 model 	 ing 	 	I	 end 	 ed 	 	up	in	all	 place 	 s 	 	,	in	Eritrea	,	in	the	Horn	of	 Afri 	 ca 	 	.
Eritrea	,	 form 	 er 	 ly 	 	part	of	Ethiopia	,	is	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 place 	 s 	 	that	is	 astonish 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 star 	 k 	 	,	and	I	have	no	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	how	people	 e 	 ke 	 	out	a	living	there	.
It	is	so	dry	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	what	I	saw	.
But	 th 	 is 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	what	I	saw	.
I	saw	a	company	that	had	taken	 sea 	 water 	 	and	sand	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	growing	a	kind	of	crop	that	will	grow	on	 pur 	 e 	 	salt	water	 with 	 out 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	treat	it	.
And	it	will	produce	a	food	crop	.
In	 th 	 is 	 	case	it	was	 oil 	 seed 	 	.
It	was	 astonish 	 ing 	 	.	 The 	 y 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 so 	 	producing	 man 	 grove 	 s 	 	in	a	 plant 	 ation 	 	.
And	the	 man 	 grove 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	wood	and	honey	and	 leav 	 es 	 	for	the	 animal 	 s 	 	,	so	that	they	could	produce	milk	and	 what 	 not 	 	,	like	we	had	in	the	 Bio 	 sphere 	 	.
And	all	of	it	was	coming	from	 th 	 is 	 	:	shrimp	 farm 	 s 	 	.
 Shri 	 mp 	 	 farm 	 s 	 	are	a	 scour 	 ge 	 	on	the	earth	,	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	from	an	 environment 	 al 	 	point	of	view	.
 The 	 y 	 	pour	huge	 amount 	 s 	 	of	 pollutant 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	ocean	.
 The 	 y 	 	 al 	 so 	 	pollute	 the 	 ir 	 	 next 	 - 	 door 	 	 neighbor 	 s 	 	.
So	they	're	all	 s 	 hitting 	 	each	other	's	 pond 	 s 	 	,	 quit 	 e 	 	 liter 	 ally 	 	.
And	what	 th 	 is 	 	project	was	 do 	 ing 	 	was	taking	the	 ef 	 fluent 	 	of	these	,	and	 turn 	 ing 	 	them	 in 	 to 	 	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	food	.
 The 	 y 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 liter 	 ally 	 	 turn 	 ing 	 	 poll 	 ution 	 	 in 	 to 	 	abundance	for	a	desert	people	.
 The 	 y 	 	had	 create 	 d 	 	an	industrial	 eco 	 system 	 	,	of	a	sense	.
I	was	there	 be 	 cause 	 	I	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 model 	 ing 	 	the	 man 	 grove 	 	 port 	 ion 	 	for	a	carbon	credit	program	,	under	the	 U. 	 N 	 	.
Kyoto	 Pro 	 to 	 col 	 	system	.
And	 a 	 s 	 	I	was	 model 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 man 	 grove 	 	swamp	,	I	was	 think 	 ing 	 	to	 my 	 self 	 	,	``	How	do	you	put	a	box	around	 th 	 is 	 	?	''
When	I	'm	 model 	 ing 	 	a	plant	in	a	box	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	I	know	where	to	draw	the	 bound 	 ary 	 	.
In	a	 man 	 grove 	 	forest	like	 th 	 is 	 	I	have	no	idea	.
Well	,	of	course	you	have	to	draw	the	 bound 	 ary 	 	around	the	whole	of	the	Earth	.
And	understand	 it 	 s 	 	 interact 	 ions 	 	with	the	entire	Earth	.
And	put	your	project	in	that	 con 	 text 	 	.
 A 	 round 	 	the	world	 to 	 day 	 	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	an	 in 	 credible 	 	 transform 	 ation 	 	,	from	what	I	would	call	a	 bio 	 cidal 	 	species	,	one	that	--	 whet 	 her 	 	we	 intentional 	 ly 	 	or	 un 	 intentional 	 ly 	 	--	have	designed	our	 system 	 s 	 	to	kill	life	,	a	lot	of	the	time	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	in	fact	,	 th 	 is 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	photograph	,	is	in	fact	over	the	Amazon	.
And	here	the	light	green	are	 area 	 s 	 	of	massive	 de 	 forest 	 ation 	 	.
And	 t 	 hose 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 wis 	 py 	 	 cloud 	 s 	 	are	,	in	fact	,	 fire 	 s 	 	,	 human 	 - 	 made 	 	 fire 	 s 	 	.
We	're	in	the	process	of	 transform 	 ing 	 	from	 th 	 is 	 	,	to	what	I	would	call	a	 bio 	 philic 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	one	where	we	learn	to	nurture	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	it	may	not	seem	like	it	,	but	we	are	.
It	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	all	 a 	 cross 	 	the	world	,	in	every	kind	of	walk	of	life	,	and	every	kind	of	 care 	 er 	 	and	industry	that	you	can	think	of	.
And	I	think	often	 time 	 s 	 	people	get	lost	in	that	.
 The 	 y 	 	go	,	``	But	how	can	I	possibly	find	my	way	in	that	?
It	's	 s 	 uch 	 	a	huge	subject	.	''
And	I	would	say	that	the	small	stuff	 count 	 s 	 	.	It	 re 	 ally 	 	 do 	 es 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	story	of	a	rake	in	my	 back 	 yard 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	was	my	 back 	 yard 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	early	on	,	when	I	 b 	 ought 	 	my	 proper 	 ty 	 	.
And	in	Arizona	,	of	course	,	 every 	 body 	 	 put 	 s 	 	 grave 	 l 	 	down	.
And	they	like	to	keep	 every 	 thing 	 	 beaut 	 i 	 fully 	 	 rak 	 ed 	 	.	And	they	keep	all	the	 leav 	 es 	 	away	.
And	on	 Sun 	 day 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	the	 neighbor 	 s 	 	leaf	 blow 	 er 	 	 come 	 s 	 	out	,	and	I	want	to	throttle	them	.
It	's	a	certain	type	of	aesthetic	.
We	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 comfort 	 able 	 	with	 un 	 tidi 	 ness 	 	.
And	I	threw	away	my	rake	.
And	I	let	all	of	the	 leav 	 es 	 	fall	from	the	 tree 	 s 	 	that	I	have	on	my	 proper 	 ty 	 	.
And	over	time	,	 essential 	 ly 	 	what	have	I	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	?
I	've	 be 	 en 	 	building	 top 	 s 	 oil 	 	.
And	so	now	all	the	 bird 	 s 	 	come	in	.	And	I	have	 hawk 	 s 	 	.
And	I	have	an	 oa 	 sis 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	what	 happen 	 s 	 	every	spring	.	For	six	 week 	 s 	 	,	six	to	eight	 week 	 s 	 	,	I	have	 th 	 is 	 	flush	of	green	 oa 	 sis 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	in	a	 rip 	 arian 	 	area	.
And	all	of	 Tu 	 c 	 son 	 	could	be	like	 th 	 is 	 	if	 every 	 body 	 	would	just	revolt	and	throw	away	the	rake	.
The	small	stuff	 count 	 s 	 	.
The	 Indus 	 trial 	 	 R 	 evolution 	 	--	and	 Pro 	 me 	 the 	 us 	 	--	 ha 	 s 	 	 give 	 n 	 	us	 th 	 is 	 	,	the	ability	to	light	up	the	world	.
It	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 give 	 n 	 	us	 th 	 is 	 	,	the	ability	to	look	at	the	world	from	the	 out 	 side 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	we	may	not	all	have	 an 	 other 	 	 bio 	 sphere 	 	that	we	can	run	to	,	and	 compar 	 e 	 	it	to	 th 	 is 	 	 bio 	 sphere 	 	.
But	we	can	look	at	the	world	,	and	try	to	understand	where	we	are	in	 it 	 s 	 	 con 	 text 	 	,	and	how	we	 choos 	 e 	 	to	interact	with	it	.
And	if	you	lose	where	you	are	in	your	 bio 	 sphere 	 	,	or	are	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	 difficult 	 y 	 	 connect 	 ing 	 	with	where	you	are	in	the	 bio 	 sphere 	 	,	I	would	say	to	you	,	take	a	deep	breath	.
The	 yogi 	 s 	 	had	it	right	.
 Brea 	 th 	 	 do 	 es 	 	,	in	fact	,	connect	us	all	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 liter 	 al 	 	way	.
Take	a	breath	now	.
And	 a 	 s 	 	you	breathe	,	think	about	what	is	in	your	breath	.
There	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	is	the	CO2	from	the	person	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	 next 	 - 	 door 	 	to	you	.
 May 	 be 	 	there	is	a	little	bit	of	oxygen	from	some	 al 	 ga 	 e 	 	on	the	beach	not	far	from	here	.
It	 al 	 so 	 	 connect 	 s 	 	us	in	time	.
There	may	be	some	carbon	in	your	breath	from	the	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	.
There	could	 al 	 so 	 	be	carbon	that	you	are	 exhal 	 ing 	 	now	that	will	be	in	the	breath	of	your	 great 	 - 	 great 	 - 	 great 	 - 	 grand 	 children 	 	.
Thank	you	.
What	I	'd	like	you	to	do	is	,	just	 re 	 ally 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	is	just	,	sort	of	,	nod	to	the	person	on	your	right	,	and	then	nod	to	the	person	on	your	left	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	 chance 	 s 	 	are	that	over	the	last	winter	,	if	you	had	 be 	 en 	 	a	 bee 	 hive 	 	,	either	you	or	one	of	the	two	people	you	just	 nod 	 d 	 ed 	 	at	would	have	 di 	 ed 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	that	's	an	awful	lot	of	bees	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	second	year	in	a	row	we	have	lost	over	30	percent	of	the	 colon 	 ies 	 	,	or	we	estimate	we	've	lost	30	percent	of	the	 colon 	 ies 	 	over	the	winter	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	that	's	a	lot	,	a	lot	of	bees	,	and	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
And	most	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 loss 	 es 	 	are	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	we	know	.
We	know	that	there	are	these	varroa	 mite 	 s 	 	that	have	 introduc 	 ed 	 	and	 caus 	 ed 	 	a	lot	of	 loss 	 es 	 	,	and	we	 al 	 so 	 	have	 th 	 is 	 	new	 phenomen 	 on 	 	,	which	I	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	last	year	,	 Col 	 ony 	 	 Col 	 lapse 	 	 Dis 	 order 	 	.
And	here	we	see	a	picture	on	top	of	a	hill	in	 Cent 	 ral 	 	 Valle 	 y 	 	last	 De 	 c 	 emb 	 er 	 	.
And	 be 	 low 	 	,	you	can	see	all	these	out	 yard 	 s 	 	,	or	 tempor 	 ary 	 	 yard 	 s 	 	,	where	the	 colon 	 ies 	 	are	 br 	 ought 	 	in	 un 	 til 	 	 Fe 	 br 	 uary 	 	,	and	then	they	're	 ship 	 ped 	 	out	to	the	 al 	 mond 	 s 	 	.
And	one	 document 	 ary 	 	writer	,	who	was	here	and	 look 	 ed 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	two	 month 	 s 	 	after	I	was	here	,	 de 	 scribed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	not	 a 	 s 	 	 bee 	 hive 	 s 	 	but	 a 	 s 	 	a	 grave 	 yard 	 	,	with	these	empty	white	boxes	with	no	bees	left	in	them	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	I	'm	going	to	sum	up	a	year	's	worth	of	work	in	two	 sentence 	 s 	 	to	say	that	we	have	 be 	 en 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	what	the	cause	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	.
And	what	we	know	is	that	it	's	 a 	 s 	 	if	the	bees	have	caught	a	flu	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	flu	 ha 	 s 	 	 wipe 	 d 	 	through	the	population	of	bees	.
In	some	 case 	 s 	 	,	and	in	fact	in	most	 case 	 s 	 	in	one	year	,	 th 	 is 	 	flu	was	 caus 	 ed 	 	by	a	new	virus	to	us	,	or	 new 	 ly 	 	identified	by	us	,	 call 	 ed 	 	Israeli	 A 	 cute 	 	 Para 	 lysis 	 	virus	.
It	was	 call 	 ed 	 	that	 be 	 cause 	 	a	guy	in	Israel	first	found	it	,	and	he	now	 regret 	 s 	 	 pro 	 found 	 ly 	 	 call 	 ing 	 	it	that	disease	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	of	course	,	there	's	the	 implic 	 ation 	 	.
But	we	think	 th 	 is 	 	virus	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	 ubiqu 	 it 	 ous 	 	.
It	's	 al 	 so 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	clear	that	the	bees	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	catch	other	viruses	or	other	 flu 	 s 	 	,	and	so	the	question	we	're	still	 st 	 rug 	 gling 	 	with	,	and	the	question	that	 keep 	 s 	 	us	up	at	night	,	is	why	have	the	bees	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 be 	 come 	 	so	susceptible	to	 th 	 is 	 	flu	,	and	why	are	they	so	susceptible	to	these	other	 disease 	 s 	 	?
And	we	do	n't	have	the	answer	to	that	yet	,	and	we	 s 	 pend 	 	a	lot	of	time	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	that	out	.
We	think	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	it	's	a	combination	of	 factor 	 s 	 	.
We	know	from	the	work	of	a	 ver 	 y 	 	large	and	dynamic	 work 	 ing 	 	team	that	,	you	know	,	we	're	 find 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	different	 pest 	 icide 	 s 	 	in	the	hive	,	and	 surprising 	 ly 	 	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	the	 health 	 iest 	 	 hive 	 s 	 	have	the	most	 pest 	 icide 	 s 	 	.	And	so	we	discover	all	these	 ver 	 y 	 	strange	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	ca	n't	begin	to	understand	.
And	so	 th 	 is 	 	 open 	 s 	 	up	the	whole	idea	of	looking	at	 colon 	 y 	 	health	.
 N 	 ow 	 	of	course	,	if	you	lose	a	lot	of	 colon 	 ies 	 	,	 beekee 	 per 	 s 	 	can	replace	them	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
And	that	's	why	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	 re 	 cover 	 	from	a	lot	of	loss	.
If	we	lost	one	in	every	three	 cow 	 s 	 	in	the	winter	,	you	know	,	the	National	Guard	would	be	out	.
But	what	 beekee 	 per 	 s 	 	can	do	is	,	if	they	have	one	 surviv 	 ing 	 	 colon 	 y 	 	,	they	can	split	that	 colon 	 y 	 	in	two	.
And	then	the	one	half	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	a	 que 	 en 	 	,	they	can	buy	a	 que 	 en 	 	.
It	 come 	 s 	 	in	the	mail	;	it	can	come	from	Australia	or	 Hawa 	 ii 	 	or	 Flor 	 ida 	 	,	and	you	can	 introduc 	 e 	 	that	 que 	 en 	 	.
And	in	fact	,	America	was	the	first	country	that	ever	did	 mail 	 - 	 deliver 	 y 	 	 que 	 en 	 s 	 	and	in	fact	,	it	's	part	of	the	 post 	 al 	 	code	that	you	have	to	deliver	 que 	 en 	 s 	 	by	mail	in	order	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	we	have	 en 	 ough 	 	bees	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	.
If	you	do	n't	just	want	a	 que 	 en 	 	,	you	can	buy	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	a	 three 	 - 	 pound 	 	package	of	bees	,	which	 come 	 s 	 	in	the	mail	,	and	of	course	,	the	 Post 	 al 	 	Office	is	 al 	 ways 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 concern 	 ed 	 	when	they	get	,	you	know	,	your	 three 	 - 	 pound 	 	 package 	 s 	 	of	bees	.
And	you	can	install	 th 	 is 	 	in	your	hive	and	replace	that	 dead 	 - 	 out 	 	.
So	it	 mean 	 s 	 	that	 beekee 	 per 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	good	at	 re 	 placing 	 	 dead 	 - 	 out 	 s 	 	,	and	so	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	cover	 t 	 hose 	 	 loss 	 es 	 	.
So	even	 th 	 ough 	 	we	've	lost	30	percent	of	the	 colon 	 ies 	 	every	year	,	the	same	number	of	 colon 	 ies 	 	have	 exist 	 ed 	 	in	the	country	,	at	about	2.4	million	 colon 	 ies 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 loss 	 es 	 	are	tragic	on	 man 	 y 	 	 front 	 s 	 	,	and	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 front 	 s 	 	is	for	the	 beekee 	 per 	 	.
And	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	talk	about	 beekee 	 per 	 s 	 	first	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 beekee 	 per 	 s 	 	are	among	the	most	 fasci 	 nating 	 	people	you	'll	ever	meet	.
If	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	group	of	 beekee 	 per 	 s 	 	,	you	would	have	 every 	 one 	 	from	the	 card 	 - 	 carry 	 ing 	 	 N 	 RA 	 	member	who	's	,	you	know	,	live	free	or	die	,	to	the	,	you	know	,	the	 self 	 - 	 express 	 ed 	 	 quirk 	 y 	 	San	 Francis 	 co 	 	 back 	 yard 	 	pig	 farm 	 er 	 	.
And	you	get	all	of	these	people	in	the	same	room	,	and	they	're	all	 engag 	 ed 	 	and	they	're	 get 	 ting 	 	 a 	 long 	 	,	and	they	're	all	there	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 pass 	 ion 	 	for	bees	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	part	of	that	community	which	are	the	commercial	 beekee 	 per 	 s 	 	,	the	 one 	 s 	 	who	make	 the 	 ir 	 	livelihood	from	 beekee 	 ping 	 	 al 	 one 	 	.
And	these	tend	to	be	some	of	the	most	 in 	 dependent 	 	,	 ten 	 acious 	 	,	intuitive	,	you	know	,	 invent 	 ive 	 	people	you	will	ever	meet	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	just	 fasci 	 nating 	 	.	And	they	're	like	that	all	over	the	world	.
I	had	the	privilege	of	 work 	 ing 	 	in	Haiti	just	for	two	 week 	 s 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	 th 	 is 	 	year	.
And	Haiti	,	if	you	've	ever	 be 	 en 	 	there	,	is	just	a	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	.
I	mean	,	there	may	be	100	 explan 	 ations 	 	for	why	Haiti	is	the	 imp 	 over 	 ish 	 ed 	 	nation	it	is	,	but	there	is	no	excuse	to	see	that	sort	of	squalor	.
But	you	meet	 th 	 is 	 	 beekee 	 per 	 	,	and	I	met	 th 	 is 	 	 beekee 	 per 	 	here	,	and	he	is	one	of	the	most	 knowledge 	 able 	 	 beekee 	 per 	 s 	 	I	've	ever	met	.
No	 form 	 al 	 	education	,	but	 ver 	 y 	 	 knowledge 	 able 	 	.
We	 need 	 ed 	 	 bees 	 wax 	 	for	a	project	we	 we 	 re 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	;	he	was	so	 cap 	 able 	 	,	he	was	able	to	render	the	 nic 	 est 	 	block	of	 bees 	 wax 	 	I	have	ever	 s 	 een 	 	from	cow	dung	,	tin	 can 	 s 	 	and	his	veil	,	which	he	used	 a 	 s 	 	a	 screen 	 ing 	 	,	right	in	 th 	 is 	 	meadow	.	And	so	that	 ing 	 en 	 u 	 ity 	 	is	inspiring	.
We	 al 	 so 	 	have	Dave	 Hac 	 ken 	 berg 	 	,	who	is	the	 post 	 er 	 	child	of	 C 	 CD 	 	.
He	's	the	one	who	first	identified	 th 	 is 	 	condition	and	raised	the	alarm	 bell 	 s 	 	.
And	he	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	these	 truck 	 s 	 	,	and	he	's	 move 	 d 	 	these	bees	up	and	down	the	coast	.
And	a	lot	of	people	talk	about	 truck 	 s 	 	and	moving	bees	,	and	that	 be 	 ing 	 	bad	,	but	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	that	for	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
The	ancient	 Egyptian 	 s 	 	used	to	move	bees	up	and	down	the	 N 	 ile 	 	on	 raft 	 s 	 	,	so	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	a	movable	bee	force	is	not	new	at	all	.
And	one	of	our	real	 worri 	 es 	 	with	 Col 	 ony 	 	 Col 	 lapse 	 	 Dis 	 order 	 	is	the	fact	that	it	 cost 	 s 	 	so	much	money	to	replace	 t 	 hose 	 	 dead 	 - 	 out 	 	 colon 	 ies 	 	.
And	you	can	do	that	one	year	in	a	row	,	you	may	be	able	to	do	it	two	 year 	 s 	 	in	a	row	.
But	if	you	're	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	50	percent	to	80	percent	of	your	 colon 	 ies 	 	,	you	ca	n't	 surviv 	 e 	 	three	 year 	 s 	 	in	a	row	.	And	we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	 worri 	 ed 	 	about	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	segment	of	our	industry	.
And	that	's	 import 	 ant 	 	for	 man 	 y 	 	 front 	 s 	 	,	and	one	of	them	is	 be 	 cause 	 	of	that	culture	that	's	in	 agricultur 	 e 	 	.
And	these	 migr 	 atory 	 	 beekee 	 per 	 s 	 	are	the	last	 nomad 	 s 	 	of	America	.
You	know	,	they	pick	up	 the 	 ir 	 	 hive 	 s 	 	;	they	move	 the 	 ir 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	once	or	twice	in	a	year	.
And	if	you	look	at	 Flor 	 ida 	 	,	in	 Da 	 de 	 	City	,	 Flor 	 ida 	 	,	that	's	where	all	the	 Penn 	 sylvania 	 	 beekee 	 per 	 s 	 	go	.
And	then	20	 mile 	 s 	 	down	the	road	is	 Grove 	 land 	 	,	and	that	's	where	all	the	Wisconsin	 beekee 	 per 	 s 	 	go	.
And	if	you	're	ever	in	 Cent 	 ral 	 	 Valle 	 y 	 	in	 Fe 	 br 	 uary 	 	,	you	go	to	 th 	 is 	 	café	at	10	 o 	 ' 	 clock 	 	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	 Ka 	 thy 	 	and	 K 	 ate 	 	's	.
And	that	's	where	all	the	 beekee 	 per 	 s 	 	come	after	a	night	of	moving	bees	 in 	 to 	 	the	 al 	 mond 	 	 grove 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	all	have	 the 	 ir 	 	 break 	 fast 	 	and	complain	about	 every 	 one 	 	right	there	.	And	it	's	a	great	experience	,	and	I	 re 	 ally 	 	 encourag 	 e 	 	you	to	drop	in	at	that	 din 	 er 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	that	time	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	 quit 	 e 	 	essential	American	experience	.
And	we	see	these	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	,	these	 nomad 	 ic 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	,	you	know	,	father	to	son	,	father	to	son	,	and	these	 guy 	 s 	 	are	 hurt 	 ing 	 	.
And	they	're	not	people	who	like	to	ask	for	help	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	they	are	the	most	 help 	 ful 	 	people	ever	.
If	there	's	one	guy	who	 lose 	 s 	 	all	his	bees	 be 	 cause 	 	of	a	truck	 over 	 haul 	 	,	 every 	 one 	 	 pitch 	 es 	 	in	and	 give 	 s 	 	20	 hive 	 s 	 	to	help	him	replace	 t 	 hose 	 	lost	 colon 	 ies 	 	.
And	so	,	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	dynamic	,	and	I	think	,	historic	and	 excit 	 ing 	 	community	to	be	 involve 	 d 	 	with	.
Of	course	,	the	real	 import 	 ance 	 	for	bees	is	not	the	honey	.
And	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	I	 high 	 ly 	 	 encourag 	 e 	 	you	,	all	use	honey	.
I	mean	,	it	's	the	most	 ethic 	 al 	 	 sweet 	 en 	 er 	 	,	and	you	know	,	it	's	a	dynamic	and	 f 	 un 	 	 sweet 	 en 	 er 	 	.
But	we	estimate	that	about	one	in	three	 bite 	 s 	 	of	food	we	eat	is	 direct 	 ly 	 	or	 in 	 direct 	 ly 	 	 pollinat 	 ed 	 	by	 honey 	 bees 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	I	want	to	just	 illustr 	 ate 	 	that	in	the	fact	that	if	we	look	at	the	 break 	 fast 	 	I	had	 yester 	 day 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	--	a	little	cranberry	juice	,	some	 fruit 	 s 	 	,	some	granola	,	I	should	have	had	whole	wheat	bread	,	I	 real 	 ized 	 	,	but	you	know	,	jam	on	my	 Wonder 	 bread 	 	,	and	some	coffee	--	and	had	we	taken	out	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	,	--	 ex 	 cept 	 	for	the	 al 	 mond 	 s 	 	I	was	n't	going	to	pick	out	from	the	granola	--	if	we	had	taken	out	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	the	bees	had	 in 	 direct 	 ly 	 	or	 direct 	 ly 	 	 pollinat 	 ed 	 	,	we	would	n't	have	much	on	our	plate	.
So	if	we	did	not	have	bees	,	it	's	not	like	we	would	 starv 	 e 	 	,	but	 clear 	 ly 	 	our	diet	would	be	 diminish 	 ed 	 	.
It	's	 s 	 aid 	 	that	for	bees	,	the	flower	is	the	fountain	of	life	,	and	for	 flower 	 s 	 	bees	are	the	 messenger 	 s 	 	of	love	.
And	that	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	great	 express 	 ion 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	,	bees	are	the	 s 	 ex 	 	 work 	 ers 	 	for	 flower 	 s 	 	.	 The 	 y 	 	are	,	you	know	--	they	get	paid	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 service 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	get	paid	by	 poll 	 en 	 	and	nectar	,	to	move	that	male	 s 	 perm 	 	,	the	 poll 	 en 	 	,	from	flower	to	flower	.
And	there	are	 flower 	 s 	 	that	are	 self 	 - 	 infer 	 tile 	 	.	That	 mean 	 s 	 	they	ca	n't	--	the	 poll 	 en 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	bloom	ca	n't	 fertil 	 ize 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
So	in	an	apple	 orc 	 hard 	 	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	you	'll	have	 row 	 s 	 	of	10	 apple 	 s 	 	of	one	 varie 	 ty 	 	,	and	then	you	have	 an 	 other 	 	apple	tree	that	's	a	different	type	of	 poll 	 en 	 	.
And	bees	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 faith 	 ful 	 	.
When	they	're	out	 pollinat 	 ing 	 	or	 gather 	 ing 	 	 poll 	 en 	 	from	one	flower	,	they	stay	to	that	crop	 exclusive 	 ly 	 	,	in	order	to	help	generate	.
And	of	course	,	they	're	made	to	carry	 th 	 is 	 	 poll 	 en 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	build	up	a	static	electric	charge	and	the	 poll 	 en 	 	 jump 	 s 	 	on	them	and	 help 	 s 	 	spread	that	 poll 	 en 	 	from	bloom	to	bloom	.
 How 	 ever 	 	,	 honey 	 bees 	 	are	a	 minor 	 ity 	 	.
 Ho 	 ney 	 bees 	 	are	not	native	to	America	;	they	 we 	 re 	 	 introduc 	 ed 	 	with	the	 colonial 	 ists 	 	.
And	there	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	more	species	of	bees	than	there	are	 mammal 	 s 	 	and	 bird 	 s 	 	 combine 	 d 	 	.
In	 Penn 	 sylvania 	 	 al 	 one 	 	,	we	have	 be 	 en 	 	 survey 	 ing 	 	bees	for	150	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 intens 	 e 	 ly 	 	in	the	last	three	 year 	 s 	 	.
We	have	identified	over	400	species	of	bees	in	 Penn 	 sylvania 	 	.
 Thirty 	 - 	 two 	 	species	have	not	 be 	 en 	 	identified	or	found	in	the	state	since	1950	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	that	could	be	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	n't	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 ampl 	 ing 	 	right	,	but	it	 do 	 es 	 	,	I	think	,	suggest	that	 some 	 thing 	 	's	wrong	with	the	 pollinat 	 or 	 	force	.	And	these	bees	are	 fasci 	 nating 	 	.
We	have	 bumble 	 bees 	 	on	the	top	.
And	 bumble 	 bees 	 	are	what	we	call	 eu 	 social 	 	:	they	're	not	 tru 	 ly 	 	social	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	the	 que 	 en 	 	is	,	over	winter	.
We	 al 	 so 	 	have	the	sweat	bees	,	and	these	are	little	 gem 	 s 	 	 fly 	 ing 	 	around	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	like	 tin 	 y 	 	little	flies	and	they	fly	around	.
And	then	you	have	 an 	 other 	 	type	of	bee	,	which	we	call	 klepto 	 parasit 	 es 	 	,	which	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 f 	 ancy 	 	way	of	 say 	 ing 	 	,	 bad 	 - 	 minded 	 	,	 murder 	 ing 	 	--	what	's	the	word	I	'm	looking	for	?	 Mur 	 der 	 ing 	 	--	 Audi 	 ence 	 	:	Bee	?
Dennis	 van 	 Eng 	 elsdorp 	 	:	Bee	.	 Oka 	 y 	 	,	 thank 	 s 	 	.
What	these	bees	do	is	,	they	 s 	 it 	 	there	.	 Th 	 ese 	 	 so 	 lit 	 ary 	 	bees	,	they	drill	a	hole	in	the	ground	or	drill	a	hole	in	a	branch	,	and	they	collect	 poll 	 en 	 	and	make	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	ball	,	and	they	lay	an	egg	on	it	.
Well	,	these	bees	hang	out	at	that	hole	,	and	they	wait	for	that	mother	to	fly	away	,	they	go	in	,	eat	the	egg	,	and	lay	 the 	 ir 	 	own	egg	there	.	So	they	do	n't	do	any	work	.
And	so	,	in	fact	,	if	you	know	you	have	these	 klepto 	 parasit 	 ic 	 	bees	,	you	know	that	your	environment	is	 health 	 y 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	 top 	 - 	 of 	 - 	 the 	 - 	 food 	 - 	 chain 	 	bees	.
And	in	fact	,	there	is	now	a	red	list	of	 pollinat 	 ors 	 	that	we	're	 worri 	 ed 	 	have	 disappear 	 ed 	 	,	and	on	top	of	that	list	are	a	lot	of	these	 klepto 	 parasit 	 es 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	these	 bumble 	 bees 	 	.
And	in	fact	,	if	you	 guy 	 s 	 	live	on	the	West	Coast	,	go	to	these	 web 	 s 	 ites 	 	here	,	and	they	're	 re 	 ally 	 	looking	for	people	to	look	for	some	of	these	 bumble 	 bees 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	think	some	have	gone	extinct	.	Or	some	,	the	population	 ha 	 s 	 	 decline 	 d 	 	.
And	so	it	's	not	just	 honey 	 bees 	 	that	are	in	trouble	,	but	we	do	n't	understand	these	native	 pollinat 	 ors 	 	or	all	 t 	 hose 	 	other	 part 	 s 	 	of	our	community	.
And	of	course	,	bees	are	not	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	factor	here	.
There	are	other	 animal 	 s 	 	that	 pollinat 	 e 	 	,	like	 bat 	 s 	 	,	and	 bat 	 s 	 	are	in	trouble	too	.
And	I	'm	glad	I	'm	a	bee	man	and	not	a	bat	man	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	no	money	to	research	the	bat	 problem 	 s 	 	.
And	 bat 	 s 	 	are	 dy 	 ing 	 	at	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	rate	.
 White 	 - 	 nose 	 	syndrome	 ha 	 s 	 	 wipe 	 d 	 	out	 population 	 s 	 	of	 bat 	 s 	 	.
If	there	's	a	cave	in	New	York	that	had	15,000	 bat 	 s 	 	in	it	,	and	there	are	1,000	left	.	That	's	like	San	 Francis 	 co 	 	 be 	 coming 	 	the	population	of	half	of	 th 	 is 	 	 count 	 y 	 	in	three	 year 	 s 	 	.
And	so	that	's	 in 	 credible 	 	.	And	there	's	no	money	to	do	that	.
But	I	'm	glad	to	say	that	I	think	we	know	the	cause	of	all	these	 condition 	 s 	 	,	and	that	cause	is	 N 	 DD 	 	:	Nature	 Defi 	 cit 	 	 Dis 	 order 	 	.
And	that	is	that	I	think	that	what	we	have	in	our	 socie 	 ty 	 	is	,	we	 for 	 got 	 	our	 connect 	 ion 	 	with	nature	.
And	I	think	if	we	 re 	 connect 	 	to	nature	,	we	'll	be	able	to	have	the	 resource 	 s 	 	and	that	interest	to	solve	these	 problem 	 s 	 	.
And	I	think	that	there	is	an	easy	cure	for	 N 	 DD 	 	.
And	that	is	,	make	 meadow 	 s 	 	and	not	 lawn 	 s 	 	.
And	I	think	we	have	lost	our	 connect 	 ion 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	way	of	 re 	 connect 	 ing 	 	to	our	environment	.
I	've	had	the	privilege	of	living	by	a	meadow	for	the	last	little	while	,	and	it	is	 terr 	 ibly 	 	 engag 	 ing 	 	.
And	if	we	look	at	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 lawn 	 s 	 	,	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	tragic	.
It	used	to	be	,	two	,	three	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	that	a	lawn	was	a	symbol	of	 pre 	 stig 	 e 	 	,	and	so	it	was	 on 	 ly 	 	the	 ver 	 y 	 	rich	that	could	keep	these	green	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 desert 	 s 	 	:	they	're	 total 	 ly 	 	 steril 	 e 	 	.
 American 	 s 	 	 s 	 pent 	 	,	in	2001	--	11	percent	of	all	 pest 	 icide 	 	use	was	 d 	 one 	 	on	 lawn 	 s 	 	.
Five	percent	of	our	 green 	 house 	 	 gas 	 es 	 	are	 produce 	 d 	 	by	 mow 	 ing 	 	our	 lawn 	 s 	 	.
And	so	it	's	 in 	 credible 	 	the	amount	of	 resource 	 s 	 	we	've	 s 	 pent 	 	 keep 	 ing 	 	our	 lawn 	 s 	 	,	which	are	these	 use 	 less 	 	 bio 	 system 	 s 	 	.
And	so	we	need	to	 re 	 think 	 	 th 	 is 	 	idea	.
In	fact	,	you	know	,	the	White	House	used	to	have	sheep	in	front	in	order	to	help	fund	the	war	effort	in	World	War	I	,	which	 prob 	 ably 	 	is	not	a	bad	idea	;	it	would	n't	be	a	bad	idea	.
I	want	to	say	 th 	 is 	 	not	 be 	 cause 	 	I	'm	 oppos 	 ed 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	to	 mow 	 ing 	 	 lawn 	 s 	 	.
I	think	that	there	is	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	some	advantage	to	 keep 	 ing 	 	 lawn 	 s 	 	at	a	 limit 	 ed 	 	scale	,	and	I	think	we	're	 encourag 	 ed 	 	to	do	that	.
But	I	 al 	 so 	 	want	to	reinforce	some	of	the	 idea 	 s 	 	we	've	heard	here	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	meadow	or	living	by	a	meadow	is	 transform 	 ation 	 al 	 	.
That	it	is	 amaz 	 ing 	 	that	 connect 	 ion 	 	we	can	have	with	what	's	there	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	 milk 	 weed 	 	 plant 	 s 	 	have	grown	up	in	my	meadow	over	the	last	four	 year 	 s 	 	.	Add	to	watch	the	different	 plant 	 s 	 	,	or	 insect 	 s 	 	,	that	come	to	these	 flower 	 s 	 	,	to	watch	that	--	and	we	've	heard	about	,	you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	relationship	you	can	have	with	wine	,	 th 	 is 	 	companion	you	can	have	 a 	 s 	 	it	 mature 	 s 	 	and	 a 	 s 	 	it	 ha 	 s 	 	these	different	 fragr 	 ance 	 s 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	companion	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	relationship	that	never	 d 	 ries 	 	up	.
You	never	run	out	of	that	companion	 a 	 s 	 	you	drink	 th 	 is 	 	wine	,	too	.
And	I	 encourag 	 e 	 	you	to	look	at	that	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	not	all	of	us	have	 meadow 	 s 	 	,	or	 lawn 	 s 	 	that	we	can	convert	,	and	so	you	can	 al 	 ways 	 	,	of	course	,	grow	a	meadow	in	a	pot	.
 Bee 	 s 	 	 ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	,	can	be	the	 gate 	 way 	 	to	,	you	know	,	other	 thing 	 s 	 	.
So	I	'm	not	 say 	 ing 	 	that	you	should	plant	a	meadow	of	pot	,	but	a	pot	in	a	meadow	.
But	you	can	 al 	 so 	 	have	 th 	 is 	 	great	community	of	city	or	 building 	 - 	 top 	 	 beekee 	 per 	 s 	 	,	these	 beekee 	 per 	 s 	 	that	live	--	 Th 	 is 	 	is	in	Paris	where	these	 beekee 	 per 	 s 	 	live	.
And	 every 	 one 	 	should	open	a	 bee 	 hive 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	the	most	 amaz 	 ing 	 	,	 in 	 credible 	 	thing	.
And	if	we	want	to	cure	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	of	 N 	 DD 	 	,	or	Nature	 Defi 	 cit 	 	 Dis 	 order 	 	,	I	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	great	way	of	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
Get	a	 bee 	 hive 	 	and	grow	a	meadow	,	and	watch	that	life	come	back	 in 	 to 	 	your	life	.
And	so	with	that	,	I	think	that	what	we	can	do	,	if	we	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	can	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	our	future	--	our	more	perfect	future	--	 include 	 s 	 	 beekee 	 per 	 s 	 	and	it	 include 	 s 	 	bees	and	it	 include 	 s 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 meadow 	 s 	 	.
And	that	journey	--	that	journey	of	 transform 	 ation 	 	that	 occur 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	you	grow	your	meadow	and	 a 	 s 	 	you	keep	your	bees	or	you	watch	 t 	 hose 	 	native	bees	there	--	is	an	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	one	.
And	I	hope	that	you	experience	it	and	I	hope	you	tell	me	about	it	one	day	.
So	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	for	 be 	 ing 	 	here	.	Thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
 Some 	 time 	 s 	 	I	go	 brow 	 s 	 ing 	 	[	through	]	a	 ver 	 y 	 	old	magazine	.
I	found	 th 	 is 	 	 observ 	 ation 	 	test	about	the	story	of	the	ark	.
And	the	artist	that	drew	 th 	 is 	 	 observ 	 ation 	 	test	did	some	 error 	 s 	 	,	had	some	 mistak 	 es 	 	--	there	are	more	or	less	12	 mistak 	 es 	 	.
Some	of	them	are	 ver 	 y 	 	easy	.
There	is	a	funnel	,	an	 a 	 erial 	 	part	,	a	lamp	and	 clock 	 work 	 	key	on	the	ark	.
Some	of	them	are	about	the	 animal 	 s 	 	,	the	number	.
But	there	is	a	much	more	fundamental	 mistak 	 e 	 	in	the	 over 	 all 	 	story	of	the	ark	that	's	not	 report 	 ed 	 	here	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	problem	is	:	where	are	the	 plant 	 s 	 	?
So	now	we	have	God	that	is	going	to	 sub 	 merge 	 	Earth	 permanent 	 ly 	 	or	at	 l 	 east 	 	for	a	 ver 	 y 	 	long	period	,	and	no	one	is	taking	care	of	 plant 	 s 	 	.
 No 	 ah 	 	 need 	 ed 	 	to	take	two	of	every	kind	of	bird	,	of	every	kind	of	animal	,	of	every	kind	of	creature	that	 move 	 s 	 	,	but	no	 ment 	 ion 	 	about	 plant 	 s 	 	.
Why	?
In	 an 	 other 	 	part	of	the	same	story	,	all	the	living	 creature 	 s 	 	are	just	the	living	 creature 	 s 	 	that	came	out	from	the	ark	,	so	 bird 	 s 	 	,	 live 	 stock 	 	and	wild	 animal 	 s 	 	.
 Plan 	 ts 	 	are	not	living	 creature 	 s 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	point	.
That	is	a	point	that	is	not	coming	out	from	the	Bible	,	but	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 accompani 	 ed 	 	 human 	 ity 	 	.
Let	's	have	a	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	nice	code	that	is	coming	from	a	 Ren 	 aiss 	 ance 	 	book	.
 He 	 re 	 	we	have	the	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	of	the	order	of	nature	.
It	's	a	nice	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 start 	 ing 	 	from	left	--	you	have	the	 stone 	 s 	 	--	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	after	the	 stone 	 s 	 	,	the	 plant 	 s 	 	that	are	just	able	to	live	.
We	have	the	 animal 	 s 	 	that	are	able	to	live	and	to	sense	,	and	on	the	top	of	the	pyramid	,	there	is	the	man	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	not	the	common	man	.
The	``	 Hom 	 o 	 	 studio 	 s 	 us 	 	''	--	the	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	man	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 quit 	 e 	 	 comfort 	 ing 	 	for	people	like	me	--	I	'm	a	professor	--	 th 	 is 	 	to	be	over	there	on	the	top	of	creation	.
But	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	wrong	.
You	know	 ver 	 y 	 	well	about	 professor 	 s 	 	.
But	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	wrong	about	 plant 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 plant 	 s 	 	are	not	just	able	to	live	;	they	are	able	to	sense	.
 The 	 y 	 	are	much	more	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	in	 sens 	 ing 	 	than	 animal 	 s 	 	.
Just	to	give	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	every	single	root	 ap 	 ex 	 	is	able	to	detect	and	to	monitor	 con 	 current 	 ly 	 	and	 continu 	 ously 	 	at	 l 	 east 	 	15	different	chemical	and	physical	 parameter 	 s 	 	.
And	they	 al 	 so 	 	are	able	to	show	and	to	exhibit	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	and	complex	behavior	that	can	be	 de 	 scribed 	 	just	with	the	term	of	 intellig 	 ence 	 	.
Well	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	 under 	 estimation 	 	of	 plant 	 s 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	 al 	 ways 	 	with	us	.
Let	's	have	a	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	short	movie	now	.
We	have	 D 	 avid 	 	 Atten 	 bo 	 rough 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	 D 	 avid 	 	 Atten 	 bo 	 rough 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	a	plant	lover	;	he	did	some	of	the	most	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 movie 	 s 	 	about	plant	behavior	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	when	he	 speak 	 s 	 	about	 plant 	 s 	 	,	 every 	 thing 	 	is	correct	.
When	he	 speak 	 s 	 	about	 animal 	 s 	 	,	[	he	]	 tend 	 s 	 	to	 re 	 move 	 	the	fact	that	 plant 	 s 	 	exist	.
The	blue	whale	,	the	 big 	 gest 	 	creature	that	 exist 	 s 	 	on	the	planet	--	that	is	wrong	,	 complete 	 ly 	 	wrong	.
The	blue	whale	,	it	's	a	dwarf	if	 compar 	 ed 	 	with	the	real	 big 	 gest 	 	creature	that	 exist 	 s 	 	on	the	planet	--	that	is	,	 th 	 is 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	,	 magnific 	 ent 	 	 Sequ 	 oia 	 dendron 	 	 giga 	 nte 	 um 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	living	organism	that	 ha 	 s 	 	a	mass	of	at	 l 	 east 	 	2,000	 ton 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	the	story	that	 plant 	 s 	 	are	some	 low 	 - 	 level 	 	 organism 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 form 	 al 	 ized 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	ago	by	Aristotle	,	that	in	``	De	Anima	''	--	that	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 in 	 fluent 	 ial 	 	book	for	the	Western	 civil 	 ization 	 	--	wrote	that	the	 plant 	 s 	 	are	on	the	edge	between	living	and	not	living	.
 The 	 y 	 	have	just	a	kind	of	 ver 	 y 	 	 low 	 - 	 level 	 	soul	.
It	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 veget 	 ative 	 	soul	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	lack	 move 	 ment 	 	,	and	so	they	do	n't	need	to	sense	.
Let	's	see	.
 Oka 	 y 	 	,	some	of	the	 move 	 ments 	 	of	the	 plant 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 well 	 - 	 known 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	fast	 move 	 ment 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	Dionaea	,	a	 Ven 	 us 	 	fly	trap	 hunt 	 ing 	 	 s 	 nail 	 s 	 	--	sorry	for	the	 s 	 nail 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 re 	 fused 	 	for	centuries	,	 de 	 spite 	 	the	evidence	.
No	one	can	say	that	the	 plant 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	eat	an	animal	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	against	the	order	of	nature	.
But	 plant 	 s 	 	are	 al 	 so 	 	able	to	show	a	lot	of	 move 	 ment 	 	.
Some	of	them	are	 ver 	 y 	 	well	known	,	like	the	 flower 	 ing 	 	.
It	's	just	a	question	to	use	some	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	like	the	time	lapse	.
Some	of	them	are	much	more	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	.
Look	at	 th 	 is 	 	young	bean	that	is	moving	to	catch	the	light	every	time	.
And	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	so	 grace 	 ful 	 	;	it	's	like	a	 danc 	 ing 	 	angel	.
 The 	 y 	 	are	 al 	 so 	 	able	to	play	--	they	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	young	 s 	 un 	 flower 	 s 	 	,	and	what	they	are	 do 	 ing 	 	can	not	be	 de 	 scribed 	 	with	any	other	 term 	 s 	 	than	 play 	 ing 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	are	training	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	young	 animal 	 s 	 	do	,	to	the	adult	life	where	they	will	be	 call 	 ed 	 	to	track	the	 s 	 un 	 	all	the	day	.
 The 	 y 	 	are	able	to	respond	to	 gravit 	 y 	 	,	of	course	,	so	the	 shoot 	 s 	 	are	growing	against	the	vector	of	 gravit 	 y 	 	and	the	 root 	 s 	 	 to 	 ward 	 	the	vector	of	 gravit 	 y 	 	.
But	they	are	 al 	 so 	 	able	to	sleep	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	one	,	Mimosa	 pu 	 dica 	 	.
So	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	night	,	they	curl	the	 leav 	 es 	 	and	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	 move 	 ment 	 	,	and	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	day	,	you	have	the	 open 	 ing 	 	of	the	 leav 	 es 	 	--	there	is	much	more	 move 	 ment 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 interest 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 sleep 	 ing 	 	 machine 	 ry 	 	,	it	's	 perfect 	 ly 	 	 conserv 	 ed 	 	.
It	's	the	same	in	 plant 	 s 	 	,	in	 insect 	 s 	 	and	in	 animal 	 s 	 	.
And	so	if	you	need	to	 stud 	 y 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 sleep 	 ing 	 	problem	,	it	's	easy	to	 stud 	 y 	 	on	 plant 	 s 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	than	in	 animal 	 s 	 	and	it	's	much	more	easy	even	 ethic 	 ally 	 	.
It	's	a	kind	of	 veget 	 arian 	 	 experiment 	 ation 	 	.
 Plan 	 ts 	 	are	even	able	to	communicate	--	they	are	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 communicator 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	communicate	with	other	 plant 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	are	able	to	distinguish	kin	and	 non 	 - 	 kin 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	communicate	with	 plant 	 s 	 	of	other	species	and	they	communicate	with	 animal 	 s 	 	by	producing	chemical	 volatil 	 es 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	 pollinat 	 ion 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	with	the	 pollinat 	 ion 	 	,	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	serious	issue	for	 plant 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	move	the	 poll 	 en 	 	from	one	flower	to	the	other	,	yet	they	can	not	move	from	one	flower	to	the	other	.
So	they	need	a	vector	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	vector	,	it	's	 normal 	 ly 	 	an	animal	.
 Man 	 y 	 	 insect 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	used	by	 plant 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 vector 	 s 	 	for	the	transport	of	the	 pollinat 	 ion 	 	,	but	not	just	 insect 	 s 	 	;	even	 bird 	 s 	 	,	 reptil 	 es 	 	,	and	 mammal 	 s 	 	like	 bat 	 s 	 	 rat 	 s 	 	are	 normal 	 ly 	 	used	for	the	 transport 	 ation 	 	of	the	 poll 	 en 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	serious	business	.
We	have	the	 plant 	 s 	 	that	are	giving	to	the	 animal 	 s 	 	a	kind	of	sweet	 sub 	 stance 	 	--	 ver 	 y 	 	 energ 	 izing 	 	--	 hav 	 ing 	 	in	change	 th 	 is 	 	 transport 	 ation 	 	of	the	 poll 	 en 	 	.
But	some	 plant 	 s 	 	are	 manipul 	 ating 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	,	like	in	the	case	of	 orchid 	 s 	 	that	promise	 s 	 ex 	 	and	nectar	and	give	in	change	 noth 	 ing 	 	for	the	 transport 	 ation 	 	of	the	 poll 	 en 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	there	is	a	big	problem	 be 	 hind 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	behavior	that	we	have	 s 	 een 	 	.
How	is	it	possible	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	 with 	 out 	 	a	brain	?
We	need	to	wait	 un 	 til 	 	1880	,	when	 th 	 is 	 	big	man	,	 Char 	 les 	 	Darwin	,	 publish 	 es 	 	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	,	 astonish 	 ing 	 	book	that	 start 	 s 	 	a	revolution	.
The	title	is	``	The	Power	of	 Move 	 ment 	 	in	 Plan 	 ts 	 	.	''
No	one	was	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	speak	about	 move 	 ment 	 	in	 plant 	 s 	 	before	 Char 	 les 	 	Darwin	.
In	his	book	,	 assist 	 ed 	 	by	his	son	,	Francis	--	who	was	the	first	professor	of	plant	physiology	in	the	world	,	in	 Cam 	 bridge 	 	--	they	took	 in 	 to 	 	 consider 	 ation 	 	every	single	 move 	 ment 	 	for	500	 page 	 s 	 	.
And	in	the	last	 para 	 graph 	 	of	the	book	,	it	's	a	kind	of	 styl 	 istic 	 	mark	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 normal 	 ly 	 	 Char 	 les 	 	Darwin	 store 	 d 	 	,	in	the	last	 para 	 graph 	 	of	a	book	,	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 mess 	 age 	 	.
He	wrote	that	,	``	It	's	 hard 	 ly 	 	an	 exagge 	 ration 	 	to	say	that	the	tip	of	the	radical	 act 	 s 	 	like	the	brain	of	one	of	the	lower	 animal 	 s 	 	.	''
 Th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	metaphor	.
He	wrote	some	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 letter 	 s 	 	to	one	of	his	 friend 	 s 	 	who	was	 J. 	 D 	 	.	 Hook 	 er 	 	,	or	at	that	time	,	 p 	 resident 	 	of	the	 Ro 	 y 	 al 	 	 Socie 	 ty 	 	,	so	the	 maxim 	 um 	 	scientific	 author 	 ity 	 	in	 Brit 	 ain 	 	 s 	 peaking 	 	about	the	brain	in	the	 plant 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	root	 ap 	 ex 	 	growing	against	a	 slop 	 e 	 	.
So	you	can	 recogn 	 ize 	 	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 move 	 ment 	 	,	the	same	 move 	 ment 	 	that	 worm 	 s 	 	,	 snake 	 s 	 	and	every	animal	that	are	moving	on	the	ground	 with 	 out 	 	 leg 	 s 	 	is	able	to	 dis 	 play 	 	.
And	it	's	not	an	easy	 move 	 ment 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	,	to	have	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 move 	 ment 	 	,	you	need	to	move	different	 region 	 s 	 	of	the	root	and	to	 synchron 	 ize 	 	these	different	 region 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	brain	.
So	we	 stud 	 ied 	 	the	root	 ap 	 ex 	 	and	we	found	that	there	is	a	specific	region	that	is	here	,	 depict 	 ed 	 	in	blue	--	that	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	``	 transit 	 ion 	 	zone	.	''
And	 th 	 is 	 	region	,	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	region	--	it	's	less	than	one	millimeter	.
And	in	 th 	 is 	 	small	region	you	have	the	highest	consumption	of	oxygen	in	the	 plant 	 s 	 	and	more	 import 	 ant 	 	,	you	have	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 signal 	 s 	 	here	.
The	 signal 	 s 	 	that	you	are	 see 	 ing 	 	here	are	action	potential	,	are	the	same	 signal 	 s 	 	that	the	 neuro 	 ns 	 	of	my	brain	,	of	our	brain	,	use	to	 ex 	 change 	 	information	.
 N 	 ow 	 	we	know	that	a	root	 ap 	 ex 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	just	a	few	hundred	 cell 	 s 	 	that	show	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	feature	,	but	we	know	how	big	the	root	apparatus	of	a	small	plant	,	like	a	plant	of	 ry 	 e 	 	.
We	have	 al 	 most 	 	14	million	 root 	 s 	 	.
We	have	11	and	a	half	million	root	 ap 	 ex 	 	and	a	total	length	of	600	or	more	 kilometer 	 s 	 	and	a	 ver 	 y 	 	high	surface	area	.
 N 	 ow 	 	let	's	imagine	that	each	single	root	 ap 	 ex 	 	is	 work 	 ing 	 	in	network	with	all	the	 other 	 s 	 	.
 He 	 re 	 	 we 	 re 	 	have	on	the	left	,	the	Internet	and	on	the	right	,	the	root	apparatus	.
 The 	 y 	 	work	in	the	same	way	.
 The 	 y 	 	are	a	network	of	small	computing	 machine 	 s 	 	,	 work 	 ing 	 	in	 network 	 s 	 	.
And	why	are	they	so	similar	?
 Be 	 cause 	 	they	 evolv 	 ed 	 	for	the	same	reason	:	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	 pre 	 d 	 ation 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	work	in	the	same	way	.
So	you	can	 re 	 move 	 	90	percent	of	the	root	apparatus	and	the	 plant 	 s 	 	[	 continu 	 e 	 	]	to	work	.
You	can	 re 	 move 	 	90	percent	of	the	Internet	and	it	is	[	 continu 	 ing 	 	]	to	work	.
So	,	a	 suggest 	 ion 	 	for	the	people	 work 	 ing 	 	with	 network 	 s 	 	:	 plant 	 s 	 	are	able	to	give	you	good	 suggest 	 ions 	 	about	how	to	evolve	 network 	 s 	 	.
And	 an 	 other 	 	 possibil 	 ity 	 	is	a	 techno 	 logical 	 	 possibil 	 ity 	 	.
Let	's	imagine	that	we	can	build	 robot 	 s 	 	and	 robot 	 s 	 	that	are	inspired	by	 plant 	 s 	 	.
 Un 	 til 	 	now	,	the	man	was	inspired	just	by	man	or	the	 animal 	 s 	 	in	producing	a	robot	.
We	have	the	 animal 	 oid 	 	--	and	the	normal	 robot 	 s 	 	inspired	by	 animal 	 s 	 	,	 insect 	 oid 	 	,	so	on	.
We	have	the	 and 	 roid 	 s 	 	that	are	inspired	by	man	.
But	why	have	we	not	any	 plant 	 oid 	 	?
Well	,	if	you	want	to	fly	,	it	's	good	that	you	look	at	 bird 	 s 	 	--	to	be	inspired	by	 bird 	 s 	 	.
But	if	you	want	to	explore	 s 	 oil 	 s 	 	,	or	if	you	want	to	 colon 	 ize 	 	new	 territ 	 ory 	 	,	to	best	thing	that	you	can	do	is	to	be	inspired	by	 plant 	 s 	 	that	are	 master 	 s 	 	in	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
We	have	 an 	 other 	 	 possibil 	 ity 	 	we	are	 work 	 ing 	 	[	on	]	in	our	lab	,	[	which	]	is	to	build	 hybrid 	 s 	 	.
It	's	much	more	easy	to	build	 hybrid 	 s 	 	.
 Hy 	 brid 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	half	living	and	half	machine	.
It	's	much	more	easy	to	work	with	 plant 	 s 	 	than	with	 animal 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	have	computing	power	,	they	have	 electric 	 al 	 	 signal 	 s 	 	.
The	 connect 	 ion 	 	with	the	machine	is	much	more	easy	,	much	more	even	 ethic 	 ally 	 	possible	.
And	these	are	three	 possibil 	 ities 	 	that	we	are	 work 	 ing 	 	on	to	build	 hybrid 	 s 	 	,	driven	by	 al 	 ga 	 e 	 	or	by	the	 leav 	 es 	 	at	the	end	,	by	the	most	,	most	 power 	 ful 	 	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	 plant 	 s 	 	,	by	the	 root 	 s 	 	.
Well	,	thank	you	for	your	attention	.
And	before	I	finish	,	I	would	like	to	 re 	 assure 	 	that	no	 s 	 nail 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 harm 	 ed 	 	in	making	 th 	 is 	 	 present 	 ation 	 	.
Thank	you	.
Thank	you	.
Thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
That	was	 whistl 	 ing 	 	.
I	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	in	English	.
What	is	a	 c 	 hub 	 by 	 	,	 cur 	 ly 	 - 	 haired 	 	guy	from	 Hol 	 land 	 	--	why	is	he	 whistl 	 ing 	 	?
Well	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	I	've	[	 be 	 en 	 	]	 whistl 	 ing 	 	since	the	age	of	four	,	about	four	.
My	dad	was	 al 	 ways 	 	 whistl 	 ing 	 	around	the	house	,	and	I	just	thought	that	's	part	of	communication	in	my	family	.
So	I	 whistl 	 ed 	 	 a 	 long 	 	with	him	.
And	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	till	I	was	34	,	I	 al 	 ways 	 	 annoy 	 ed 	 	and	 irrit 	 ated 	 	people	with	 whistl 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	to	be	honest	,	my	 whistl 	 ing 	 	is	a	kind	of	 de 	 vi 	 ant 	 	behavior	.
I	 whistl 	 ed 	 	 al 	 one 	 	.	I	 whistl 	 ed 	 	in	the	 class 	 room 	 	.
I	 whistl 	 ed 	 	on	[	my	]	bike	.	I	 whistl 	 ed 	 	 every 	 where 	 	.
And	I	 al 	 so 	 	 whistl 	 ed 	 	at	a	 Christ 	 ma 	 s 	 	Eve	party	with	my	 family 	 - 	 in 	 - 	 law 	 	.
And	they	had	some	,	in	my	opinion	,	 terr 	 ible 	 	 Christ 	 ma 	 s 	 	music	.
And	when	I	hear	music	that	I	do	n't	like	,	I	try	to	make	it	better	.
So	``	 Rud 	 olph 	 	the	 Red 	 - 	 No 	 s 	 ed 	 	 Re 	 in 	 de 	 er 	 	''	--	you	know	it	?
But	it	can	 al 	 so 	 	sound	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
But	 dur 	 ing 	 	a	 Christ 	 ma 	 s 	 	party	--	at	 d 	 inner 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	--	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 annoy 	 ing 	 	.
So	my	 sister 	 - 	 in 	 - 	 law 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	a	few	 time 	 s 	 	,	``	 P 	 lease 	 	stop	 whistl 	 ing 	 	.	''
And	I	just	could	n't	.
And	at	one	point	--	and	I	had	some	wine	,	I	have	to	admit	that	--	at	one	point	I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	If	there	was	a	contest	,	I	would	join	.	''
And	two	 week 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	I	 receiv 	 ed 	 	a	text	 mess 	 age 	 	:	``	You	're	going	to	America	.	''
So	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	I	'm	going	to	America	.
I	would	love	to	,	but	why	?
So	I	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	her	up	,	of	course	.
She	 Google 	 d 	 	,	and	she	found	 th 	 is 	 	World	 Whi 	 st 	 ling 	 	 Champ 	 ion 	 ship 	 	in	America	,	of	course	.
She	did	n't	expect	me	to	go	there	.
And	I	would	have	lost	my	face	.
I	do	n't	know	if	that	's	correct	English	.
But	the	Dutch	people	here	will	understand	what	I	mean	.
I	lost	my	face	.
And	she	thought	,	``	He	will	never	go	there	.	''
But	 actual 	 ly 	 	I	did	.
So	I	went	to	 Louis 	 burg 	 	,	North	 Caro 	 lina 	 	,	 south 	 east 	 	 Unit 	 ed 	 	 Stat 	 es 	 	,	and	I	 enter 	 ed 	 	the	world	of	 whistl 	 ing 	 	.
And	I	 al 	 so 	 	 enter 	 ed 	 	the	world	 champion 	 ship 	 	,	and	I	won	there	in	2004	.
That	was	great	 f 	 un 	 	,	of	course	.
And	to	defend	my	title	--	like	judokas	do	and	 s 	 port 	 s 	 men 	 	--	I	thought	,	well	let	's	go	back	in	2005	,	and	I	won	 aga 	 in 	 	.
 Th 	 en 	 	I	could	n't	 particip 	 ate 	 	for	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	.
And	in	2008	I	 enter 	 ed 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	in	Japan	,	 To 	 kyo 	 	,	and	I	won	 aga 	 in 	 	.
So	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	now	is	I	'm	 stand 	 ing 	 	here	in	Rotterdam	,	in	the	 beaut 	 iful 	 	city	,	on	a	big	stage	,	and	I	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 whistl 	 ing 	 	.
And	 actual 	 ly 	 	I	earn	my	money	 whistl 	 ing 	 	at	the	moment	.
So	I	quit	my	day	job	 a 	 s 	 	a	nurse	.
And	I	try	to	live	my	dream	--	well	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	it	was	never	my	dream	,	but	it	 sound 	 s 	 	so	good	.
 Oka 	 y 	 	,	I	'm	not	the	 on 	 ly 	 	one	 whistl 	 ing 	 	here	.
You	say	,	``	 Hu 	 h 	 	,	what	do	you	mean	?	''
Well	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	you	are	going	to	 whistl 	 e 	 	 a 	 long 	 	.
And	then	 al 	 ways 	 	the	same	thing	 happen 	 s 	 	:	people	are	 watch 	 ing 	 	each	other	and	think	,	``	Oh	,	my	God	.
Why	?	Can	I	go	away	?	''
No	,	you	ca	n't	.
 Actu 	 ally 	 	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	.
The	track	that	I	will	 whistl 	 e 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	Fête	de	la	 Bell 	 e 	 	.	''
It	's	about	80	 minute 	 s 	 	long	.
No	,	no	,	no	.	It	's	four	 minute 	 s 	 	long	.
And	I	want	to	first	 rehears 	 e 	 	with	you	your	 whistl 	 ing 	 	.
So	I	 whistl 	 e 	 	the	tone	.
 So 	 rry 	 	.	I	 for 	 got 	 	one	thing	.
You	 whistl 	 e 	 	the	same	tone	 a 	 s 	 	me	.
I	heard	a	wide	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	 tone 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	promising	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	promising	.
I	'll	ask	the	 technician 	 s 	 	to	start	the	music	.
And	if	it	's	 start 	 ed 	 	,	I	just	point	where	you	 whistl 	 e 	 	 a 	 long 	 	,	and	we	will	see	what	 happen 	 s 	 	.
Oh	,	hah	.
I	'm	so	sorry	,	 technician 	 s 	 	.
I	'm	so	used	to	that	.
I	start	it	 my 	 self 	 	.
 Oka 	 y 	 	,	here	it	is	.
 Oka 	 y 	 	.
It	's	easy	,	is	n't	it	?
 N 	 ow 	 	 come 	 s 	 	the	 s 	 olo 	 	.	I	 pro 	 pose 	 	I	do	that	 my 	 self 	 	.
Max	 West 	 er 	 man 	 	:	 Gee 	 rt 	 	 Cha 	 trou 	 	,	the	World	 Champ 	 ion 	 	[	of	]	 Whi 	 st 	 ling 	 	.
 Gee 	 rt 	 	 Cha 	 trou 	 	:	Thank	you	.	Thank	you	.
I	 start 	 ed 	 	Improv	 Every 	 where 	 	about	10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	when	I	 move 	 d 	 	to	New	York	City	with	an	interest	in	 act 	 ing 	 	and	 come 	 dy 	 	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	I	was	new	to	the	city	,	I	did	n't	have	access	to	a	stage	,	so	I	 decide 	 d 	 	to	create	my	own	in	public	 place 	 s 	 	.
So	the	first	project	we	're	going	to	take	a	look	at	is	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	No	 P 	 ants 	 	 Sub 	 way 	 	Ride	.
 N 	 ow 	 	 th 	 is 	 	took	place	in	 Jan 	 uary 	 	of	2002	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	woman	is	the	star	of	the	video	.
She	 do 	 es 	 	n't	know	she	's	 be 	 ing 	 	 film 	 ed 	 	.
She	's	 be 	 ing 	 	 film 	 ed 	 	with	a	 hid 	 den 	 	camera	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	on	the	6	train	in	New	York	City	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	stop	 a 	 long 	 	the	line	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	two	 Dan 	 ish 	 	 guy 	 s 	 	who	come	out	and	 s 	 it 	 	down	next	to	the	 hid 	 den 	 	camera	.
And	that	's	me	right	there	in	a	 brow 	 n 	 	coat	.
It	's	about	30	 degree 	 s 	 	 out 	 side 	 	.
I	'm	 wear 	 ing 	 	a	hat	.	I	'm	 wear 	 ing 	 	a	 scar 	 f 	 	.
And	the	girl	's	going	to	notice	me	right	here	.
And	 a 	 s 	 	you	'll	see	now	,	I	'm	not	 wear 	 ing 	 	pants	.
So	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	--	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	she	's	 notice 	 d 	 	me	,	but	in	New	York	there	's	 weird 	 os 	 	on	any	 give 	 n 	 	train	car	.
One	person	's	not	that	 un 	 usual 	 	.
She	 go 	 es 	 	back	to	 read 	 ing 	 	her	book	,	which	is	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	titled	``	 Rap 	 e 	 	.	''
So	she	's	 notice 	 d 	 	the	 un 	 usual 	 	thing	,	but	she	's	gone	back	to	her	normal	life	.
 N 	 ow 	 	in	the	 mean 	 time 	 	,	I	have	six	 friend 	 s 	 	who	are	 wait 	 ing 	 	at	the	next	six	 con 	 s 	 ecutive 	 	 stop 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 under 	 wear 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	going	to	be	 enter 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	car	one	by	one	.
We	'll	act	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	we	do	n't	know	each	other	.
And	we	'll	act	 a 	 s 	 	if	it	's	just	an	 un 	 fortunate 	 	 mistak 	 e 	 	we	've	made	,	 forget 	 ting 	 	our	pants	on	 th 	 is 	 	cold	 Jan 	 uary 	 	day	.
So	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	,	she	 decide 	 s 	 	to	put	the	rape	book	away	.
And	she	 decide 	 s 	 	to	be	a	little	bit	more	aware	of	her	 surround 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	in	the	 mean 	 time 	 	,	the	two	 Dan 	 ish 	 	 guy 	 s 	 	to	the	left	of	the	camera	,	they	're	 crack 	 ing 	 	up	.
 The 	 y 	 	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 funni 	 est 	 	thing	they	've	ever	 s 	 een 	 	before	.
And	watch	her	make	eye	contact	with	them	right	about	now	.
And	I	love	that	moment	in	 th 	 is 	 	video	,	 be 	 cause 	 	before	it	 be 	 came 	 	a	 share 	 d 	 	experience	,	it	was	 some 	 thing 	 	that	was	 may 	 be 	 	a	little	bit	 scar 	 y 	 	,	or	 some 	 thing 	 	that	was	at	 l 	 east 	 	 con 	 fusing 	 	to	her	.
And	then	once	it	 be 	 came 	 	a	 share 	 d 	 	experience	,	it	was	funny	and	 some 	 thing 	 	that	she	could	laugh	at	.
So	the	train	is	now	 pull 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	third	stop	 a 	 long 	 	the	6	line	.
So	the	video	wo	n't	show	 every 	 thing 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 go 	 es 	 	on	for	 an 	 other 	 	four	 stop 	 s 	 	.
A	total	of	seven	 guy 	 s 	 	enter	 anonym 	 ously 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 under 	 wear 	 	.
At	the	eighth	stop	,	a	girl	came	in	with	a	giant	duffel	bag	and	 announce 	 d 	 	she	had	pants	for	sale	for	a	dollar	--	like	you	might	sell	 batt 	 eries 	 	or	 can 	 dy 	 	on	the	train	.
We	all	 ver 	 y 	 	matter	of	 fact 	 ly 	 	 b 	 ought 	 	a	pair	of	pants	,	put	them	on	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Thank	you	.	That	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	I	 need 	 ed 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	''	and	then	 exit 	 ed 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 reveal 	 ing 	 	what	had	 happen 	 ed 	 	and	went	in	all	different	 direction 	 s 	 	.
Thank	you	.
So	that	's	a	still	from	the	video	there	.
And	I	love	that	girl	's	 re 	 action 	 	so	much	.
And	 watch 	 ing 	 	that	 video 	 tape 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	that	day	inspired	me	to	keep	 do 	 ing 	 	what	I	do	.
And	 re 	 ally 	 	one	of	the	 point 	 s 	 	of	Improv	 Every 	 where 	 	is	to	cause	a	scene	in	a	public	place	that	is	a	positive	experience	for	other	people	.
It	's	a	 p 	 rank 	 	,	but	it	's	a	 p 	 rank 	 	that	 give 	 s 	 	 some 	 body 	 	a	great	story	to	tell	.
And	her	 re 	 action 	 	inspired	me	to	do	a	second	annual	No	 P 	 ants 	 	 Sub 	 way 	 	Ride	.
And	we	've	 continu 	 ed 	 	to	do	it	every	year	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 Jan 	 uary 	 	,	we	did	the	10th	annual	No	 P 	 ants 	 	 Sub 	 way 	 	Ride	where	a	 divers 	 e 	 	group	of	3,500	people	 rod 	 e 	 	the	train	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 under 	 wear 	 	in	New	York	--	 al 	 most 	 	every	single	train	line	in	the	city	.
And	 al 	 so 	 	in	50	other	cities	around	the	world	,	people	 particip 	 ated 	 	.
 A 	 s 	 	I	 start 	 ed 	 	taking	improv	class	at	the	 Up 	 right 	 	 Citizen 	 s 	 	Brigade	 Th 	 eater 	 	and	 meet 	 ing 	 	other	creative	people	and	other	 perform 	 ers 	 	and	 comedian 	 s 	 	,	I	 start 	 ed 	 	 a 	 mass 	 ing 	 	a	 mail 	 ing 	 	list	of	people	who	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	these	 type 	 s 	 	of	 project 	 s 	 	.
So	I	could	do	more	 large 	 - 	 scale 	 	 project 	 s 	 	.
Well	one	day	I	was	 walk 	 ing 	 	through	 Un 	 ion 	 	Square	,	and	I	saw	 th 	 is 	 	building	,	which	had	just	 be 	 en 	 	built	in	2005	.
And	there	was	a	girl	in	one	of	the	 window 	 s 	 	and	she	was	 danc 	 ing 	 	.
And	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	peculiar	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	dark	out	,	but	she	was	 back 	 - 	 lit 	 	with	 flor 	 escent 	 	 light 	 ing 	 	,	and	she	was	 ver 	 y 	 	much	 on 	 stage 	 	,	and	I	could	n't	figure	out	why	she	was	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
After	about	15	 second 	 s 	 	,	her	friend	 appear 	 ed 	 	--	she	had	 be 	 en 	 	 hid 	 ing 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	a	 dis 	 play 	 	--	and	they	 laugh 	 ed 	 	and	 hugg 	 ed 	 	each	other	and	ran	away	.
So	it	 seem 	 ed 	 	like	 may 	 be 	 	she	had	 be 	 en 	 	 da 	 red 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
So	I	got	inspired	by	that	.
 Look 	 ing 	 	at	the	entire	facade	--	there	 we 	 re 	 	70	total	 window 	 s 	 	--	and	I	 k 	 new 	 	what	I	had	to	do	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	project	is	 call 	 ed 	 	Look	Up	 Mo 	 re 	 	.	We	had	70	 act 	 ors 	 	dress	in	black	.
 Th 	 is 	 	was	 complete 	 ly 	 	 un 	 author 	 ized 	 	.
We	did	n't	let	the	 store 	 s 	 	know	we	 we 	 re 	 	coming	.
And	I	stood	in	the	park	giving	 signal 	 s 	 	.
The	first	signal	was	for	 every 	 body 	 	to	hold	up	these	 four 	 - 	 foot 	 	tall	 letter 	 s 	 	that	 spell 	 ed 	 	out	``	Look	Up	 Mo 	 re 	 	,	''	the	name	of	the	project	.
The	second	signal	was	for	 every 	 body 	 	to	do	 J 	 ump 	 ing 	 	 jack 	 s 	 	together	.
You	'll	see	that	start	right	here	.
And	then	we	had	 danc 	 ing 	 	.	We	had	 every 	 one 	 	dance	.
And	then	we	had	dance	 s 	 olo 	 s 	 	where	 on 	 ly 	 	one	person	would	dance	and	 every 	 body 	 	would	point	to	them	.
So	then	I	 g 	 ave 	 	a	new	hand	signal	,	which	 signal 	 ed 	 	the	next	 s 	 olo 	 ist 	 	down	 be 	 low 	 	in	 For 	 ever 	 	21	,	and	he	 danc 	 ed 	 	.
There	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	other	 activ 	 ities 	 	.
We	had	people	 jump 	 ing 	 	up	and	down	,	people	dropping	to	the	ground	.
And	I	was	 stand 	 ing 	 	just	 anonym 	 ously 	 	in	a	 sweat 	 shirt 	 	,	 put 	 ting 	 	my	hand	on	and	off	of	a	 trash 	 can 	 	to	signal	the	 advance 	 ment 	 	.
And	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	in	 Un 	 ion 	 	Square	Park	,	right	by	a	 sub 	 way 	 	station	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	people	by	the	end	who	 stop 	 ped 	 	and	 look 	 ed 	 	up	and	 watch 	 ed 	 	what	we	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	.
There	's	a	better	photo	of	it	.
So	that	 part 	 icular 	 	event	was	inspired	by	a	moment	that	I	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	 s 	 tumble 	 	 up 	 on 	 	.
The	next	project	I	want	to	show	was	 give 	 n 	 	to	me	in	an	email	from	a	 strange 	 r 	 	.
A	high	school	kid	in	Texas	wrote	me	in	2006	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	You	should	get	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	people	 a 	 s 	 	possible	to	put	on	blue	polo	 shirt 	 s 	 	and	 kh 	 aki 	 	pants	and	go	 in 	 to 	 	a	 B 	 est 	 	Buy	and	stand	around	.	''
So	I	wrote	 th 	 is 	 	high	school	kid	back	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	,	and	I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Yes	,	you	are	correct	.
I	think	I	'll	try	to	do	that	 th 	 is 	 	 week 	 end 	 	.	Thank	you	.	''
So	here	's	the	video	.
So	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	2005	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	 B 	 est 	 	Buy	in	New	York	City	.
We	had	about	80	people	show	up	to	 particip 	 ate 	 	,	 enter 	 ing 	 	 one 	 - 	 by 	 - 	 one 	 	.
There	was	an	eight	 year 	 - 	 old 	 	girl	,	a	10	 year 	 - 	 old 	 	girl	.
There	was	 al 	 so 	 	a	65	 year 	 - 	 old 	 	man	who	 particip 	 ated 	 	.
So	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 divers 	 e 	 	group	of	people	.
And	I	told	people	,	``	Do	n't	work	.	Do	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	work	.
But	 al 	 so 	 	,	do	n't	shop	.
Just	stand	around	and	do	n't	face	 product 	 s 	 	.	''
 N 	 ow 	 	you	can	see	the	regular	 employ 	 ees 	 	by	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	have	the	yellow	 tag 	 s 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	shirt	.
 Every 	 body 	 	else	is	one	of	our	 act 	 ors 	 	.
The	lower	level	 employ 	 ees 	 	thought	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	funny	.
And	in	fact	,	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	of	them	went	to	go	get	 the 	 ir 	 	camera	from	the	break	room	and	took	 photo 	 s 	 	with	us	.
A	lot	of	them	made	 joke 	 s 	 	about	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	us	to	go	to	the	back	to	get	heavy	 tele 	 vision 	 	 set 	 s 	 	for	 custom 	 ers 	 	.
The	 manage 	 rs 	 	and	the	security	 guard 	 s 	 	,	on	the	other	hand	,	did	not	find	it	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	funny	.
You	can	see	them	in	 th 	 is 	 	 foot 	 age 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	 wear 	 ing 	 	either	a	yellow	shirt	or	a	black	shirt	.
And	we	 we 	 re 	 	there	 prob 	 ably 	 	10	 minute 	 s 	 	before	the	 manage 	 rs 	 	 decide 	 d 	 	to	dial	911	.
So	they	 start 	 ed 	 	running	around	 tell 	 ing 	 	 every 	 body 	 	the	 cop 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	coming	,	watch	out	,	the	 cop 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	coming	.
And	you	can	see	the	 cop 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 foot 	 age 	 	right	here	.
That	's	a	cop	 wear 	 ing 	 	black	right	there	,	 be 	 ing 	 	 film 	 ed 	 	with	a	 hid 	 den 	 	camera	.
 Ulti 	 mate 	 ly 	 	,	the	police	had	to	inform	 B 	 est 	 	Buy	management	that	it	was	not	,	in	fact	,	 il 	 legal 	 	to	wear	a	blue	polo	shirt	and	 kh 	 aki 	 	pants	.
So	we	had	 be 	 en 	 	there	for	20	 minute 	 s 	 	;	we	 we 	 re 	 	happy	to	exit	the	store	.
One	thing	the	 manage 	 rs 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	was	to	track	down	our	 camera 	 s 	 	.
And	they	caught	a	couple	of	my	 guy 	 s 	 	who	had	 hid 	 den 	 	 camera 	 s 	 	in	duffel	 bag 	 s 	 	.
But	the	one	camera	guy	they	never	caught	was	the	guy	that	went	in	just	with	a	blank	tape	and	went	over	to	the	 B 	 est 	 	Buy	camera	 depart 	 ment 	 	and	just	put	his	tape	in	one	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 camera 	 s 	 	and	 pretend 	 ed 	 	to	shop	.
So	I	like	that	 con 	 cept 	 	of	using	 the 	 ir 	 	own	technology	against	them	.
I	think	our	best	 project 	 s 	 	are	 one 	 s 	 	that	are	 s 	 ite 	 	specific	and	happen	at	a	 part 	 icular 	 	place	for	a	reason	.
And	one	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	I	was	 rid 	 ing 	 	the	 sub 	 way 	 	.
I	had	to	make	a	transfer	at	the	53rd	 St 	 . 	 	stop	where	there	are	these	two	giant	 escal 	 ators 	 	.
And	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 depress 	 ing 	 	place	to	be	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 crowd 	 ed 	 	.
So	I	 decide 	 d 	 	to	try	and	stage	 some 	 thing 	 	that	could	make	it	 a 	 s 	 	happy	 a 	 s 	 	possible	for	one	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	was	in	the	winter	of	2009	--	8:30	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
It	's	 morn 	 ing 	 	rush	hour	.
It	's	 ver 	 y 	 	cold	 out 	 side 	 	.
People	are	coming	in	from	 Queen 	 s 	 	,	 transfer 	 ring 	 	from	the	E	train	to	the	6	train	.
And	they	're	going	up	these	giant	 escal 	 ators 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	way	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 job 	 s 	 	.
Thank	you	.
So	there	's	a	photograph	that	 illustr 	 ates 	 	it	a	little	bit	better	.
He	 g 	 ave 	 	2,000	high	 five 	 s 	 	that	day	,	and	he	 wash 	 ed 	 	his	 hand 	 s 	 	before	and	 after 	 ward 	 	and	did	not	get	sick	.
And	that	was	 d 	 one 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 per 	 mission 	 	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	no	one	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	care	.
So	I	'd	say	over	the	 year 	 s 	 	,	one	of	the	most	common	 critic 	 ism 	 s 	 	I	see	of	Improv	 Every 	 where 	 	left	 anonym 	 ously 	 	on	YouTube	 comment 	 s 	 	is	:	``	 Th 	 ese 	 	people	have	too	much	time	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	.	''
And	you	know	,	not	 every 	 body 	 	's	going	to	like	 every 	 thing 	 	you	do	,	and	I	've	 certain 	 ly 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	thick	skin	 thank 	 s 	 	to	Internet	 comment 	 s 	 	,	but	that	one	's	 al 	 ways 	 	 both 	 er 	 ed 	 	me	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	do	n't	have	too	much	time	on	our	 hand 	 s 	 	.
The	 particip 	 ants 	 	at	Improv	 Every 	 where 	 	 event 	 s 	 	have	just	 a 	 s 	 	much	leisure	time	 a 	 s 	 	any	other	New	 York 	 ers 	 	,	they	just	 occasion 	 ally 	 	 choos 	 e 	 	to	 s 	 pend 	 	it	in	an	 un 	 usual 	 	way	.
You	know	,	every	Saturday	and	 Sun 	 day 	 	,	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	each	fall	gather	in	 foot 	 ball 	 	 stad 	 ium 	 s 	 	to	watch	 game 	 s 	 	.
And	I	've	never	 s 	 een 	 	 any 	 body 	 	comment	,	looking	at	a	 foot 	 ball 	 	game	,	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	All	 t 	 hose 	 	people	in	the	 stand 	 s 	 	,	they	have	too	much	time	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	.	''
And	of	course	they	do	n't	.
It	's	a	 perfect 	 ly 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	way	to	 s 	 pent 	 	a	 week 	 end 	 	afternoon	,	 watch 	 ing 	 	a	 foot 	 ball 	 	game	in	a	 stad 	 ium 	 	.
But	I	think	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	 perfect 	 ly 	 	valid	way	to	 s 	 pend 	 	an	afternoon	freezing	in	place	with	200	people	in	the	Grand	 Cent 	 ral 	 	terminal	or	 dress 	 ing 	 	up	like	a	 ghost 	 buster 	 	and	running	through	the	New	York	 Pub 	 lic 	 	 Libra 	 ry 	 	.
Or	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	the	same	 MP 	 3 	 	 a 	 s 	 	3,000	other	people	and	 danc 	 ing 	 	 silent 	 ly 	 	in	a	park	,	or	 burst 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	song	in	a	 grocer 	 y 	 	store	 a 	 s 	 	part	of	a	 spontane 	 ous 	 	musical	,	or	 div 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	ocean	in	 Con 	 ey 	 	Island	 wear 	 ing 	 	 form 	 al 	 	attire	.
You	know	,	 a 	 s 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	,	we	're	taught	to	play	.
And	we	're	never	 give 	 n 	 	a	reason	why	we	should	play	.
It	's	just	 accept 	 able 	 	that	play	is	a	good	thing	.
And	I	think	that	's	sort	of	the	point	of	Improv	 Every 	 where 	 	.
It	's	that	there	is	no	point	and	that	there	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	to	be	a	point	.
We	do	n't	need	a	reason	.
 A 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	it	's	 f 	 un 	 	and	it	 seem 	 s 	 	like	it	's	going	to	be	a	funny	idea	and	it	 seem 	 s 	 	like	the	people	who	witness	it	will	 al 	 so 	 	have	a	 f 	 un 	 	time	,	then	that	's	 en 	 ough 	 	for	us	.
And	I	think	,	 a 	 s 	 	 adult 	 s 	 	,	we	need	to	learn	that	there	's	no	right	or	wrong	way	to	play	.
Thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
It	's	 wonder 	 ful 	 	to	be	back	.
I	love	 th 	 is 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 gather 	 ing 	 	.
And	you	must	be	 wonder 	 ing 	 	,	``	What	on	Earth	?
 Hav 	 e 	 	they	put	up	the	wrong	slide	?	''
No	,	no	.
Look	at	 th 	 is 	 	 magnific 	 ent 	 	beast	and	ask	the	question	--	who	designed	it	?
 Th 	 is 	 	is	TED	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 Techno 	 logy 	 	,	 Enter 	 tain 	 ment 	 	,	Design	and	there	's	a	 dai 	 ry 	 	cow	.
It	's	a	 quit 	 e 	 	 wonder 	 fully 	 	designed	animal	.
And	I	was	 think 	 ing 	 	,	how	do	I	 introduc 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	?
And	I	thought	,	well	,	 may 	 be 	 	that	old	 dog 	 ger 	 el 	 	by	 Jo 	 y 	 ce 	 	 Kil 	 mer 	 	,	you	know	:	``	Poems	are	made	by	 fool 	 s 	 	like	me	,	but	 on 	 ly 	 	God	can	make	a	tree	.	''
And	you	might	say	,	``	Well	,	God	designed	the	cow	.	''
But	,	of	course	,	God	got	a	lot	of	help	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	 ance 	 s 	 tor 	 	of	cattle	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	 Or 	 yx 	 	.
And	it	was	designed	by	natural	 s 	 election 	 	,	the	process	of	natural	 s 	 election 	 	,	over	 man 	 y 	 	 million 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
And	then	it	 be 	 came 	 	 domestic 	 ated 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
And	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	 be 	 came 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 steward 	 s 	 	,	and	,	 with 	 out 	 	even	 know 	 ing 	 	what	they	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	,	they	 gradu 	 ally 	 	 re 	 designed 	 	it	and	 re 	 designed 	 	it	and	 re 	 designed 	 	it	.
And	then	,	more	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	they	 re 	 ally 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	to	do	sort	of	reverse	 engineer 	 ing 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	beast	and	figure	out	just	what	the	 part 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	,	how	they	 work 	 ed 	 	and	how	they	might	be	 optimize 	 d 	 	--	how	they	might	be	made	better	.
 N 	 ow 	 	why	am	I	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 cow 	 s 	 	?
 Be 	 cause 	 	I	want	to	say	that	much	the	same	thing	is	true	of	 relig 	 ions 	 	.
 Religion 	 s 	 	are	natural	 phenomen 	 a 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	just	 a 	 s 	 	natural	 a 	 s 	 	 cow 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	have	 evolv 	 ed 	 	over	millennia	.
 The 	 y 	 	have	a	 bio 	 logical 	 	base	,	just	like	the	 Or 	 yx 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	have	 be 	 come 	 	 domestic 	 ated 	 	,	and	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 re 	 design 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 relig 	 ions 	 	for	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	TED	,	and	I	want	to	talk	about	design	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	what	I	've	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	for	the	last	four	 year 	 s 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	since	the	first	time	you	saw	me	--	some	of	you	saw	me	at	TED	when	I	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	and	in	the	last	four	 year 	 s 	 	I	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	just	about	 non 	 - 	 stop 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	 top 	 ic 	 	.
And	you	might	say	it	's	about	the	reverse	 engineer 	 ing 	 	of	 relig 	 ions 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	that	 ver 	 y 	 	idea	,	I	think	,	 strike 	 s 	 	terror	in	 man 	 y 	 	people	,	or	anger	,	or	 anxie 	 ty 	 	of	one	sort	or	 an 	 other 	 	.
And	that	is	the	spell	that	I	want	to	break	.
I	want	to	say	,	no	,	 relig 	 ions 	 	are	an	 import 	 ant 	 	natural	 phenomen 	 on 	 	.
We	should	 stud 	 y 	 	them	with	the	same	 intens 	 ity 	 	that	we	 stud 	 y 	 	all	the	other	 import 	 ant 	 	natural	 phenomen 	 a 	 	,	like	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	heard	so	 eloquent 	 ly 	 	last	night	from	Al	 Go 	 re 	 	.
 To 	 day 	 	's	 relig 	 ions 	 	are	 brilli 	 ant 	 ly 	 	designed	--	 brilli 	 ant 	 ly 	 	designed	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	 immense 	 ly 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	social	 institution 	 s 	 	and	 man 	 y 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 feature 	 s 	 	can	be	 trac 	 ed 	 	back	to	 ear 	 lier 	 	 feature 	 s 	 	that	we	can	 re 	 ally 	 	make	sense	of	by	reverse	 engineer 	 ing 	 	.
And	,	 a 	 s 	 	with	the	cow	,	there	's	a	 mix 	 ture 	 	of	 evolution 	 ary 	 	design	,	designed	by	natural	 s 	 election 	 	 it 	 self 	 	,	and	intelligent	design	--	more	or	less	intelligent	design	--	and	 re 	 designed 	 	by	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	who	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 re 	 design 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 relig 	 ions 	 	.
You	do	n't	do	book	 talk 	 s 	 	at	TED	,	but	I	'm	going	to	have	just	one	slide	about	my	book	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	is	one	 mess 	 age 	 	in	it	which	I	think	 th 	 is 	 	group	 re 	 ally 	 	 need 	 s 	 	to	hear	.
And	I	would	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	to	get	your	 respons 	 es 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	.
It	's	the	one	policy	proposal	that	I	make	in	the	book	,	at	 th 	 is 	 	time	when	I	claim	not	to	know	 en 	 ough 	 	about	 relig 	 ion 	 	to	know	what	other	policy	 proposal 	 s 	 	to	make	.
And	it	's	one	that	 echo 	 es 	 	 remark 	 s 	 	that	you	've	heard	 al 	 ready 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
 He 	 re 	 	's	my	proposal	.
I	'm	going	to	just	take	a	couple	of	 minute 	 s 	 	to	explain	it	--	education	in	world	 relig 	 ions 	 	,	on	world	 relig 	 ions 	 	,	for	all	of	our	children	in	 prim 	 ary 	 	school	,	in	high	school	,	in	public	 school 	 s 	 	,	in	private	 school 	 s 	 	and	in	home	 school 	 ing 	 	.
So	what	I	'm	 pro 	 posing 	 	is	,	just	 a 	 s 	 	we	 requir 	 e 	 	 read 	 ing 	 	,	writing	,	arithmetic	,	American	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	so	we	should	have	a	curriculum	on	 fact 	 s 	 	about	all	the	 relig 	 ions 	 	of	the	world	--	about	 the 	 ir 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	about	 the 	 ir 	 	 cre 	 ed 	 s 	 	,	about	 the 	 ir 	 	 text 	 s 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	music	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 symbol 	 ism 	 s 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 prohibit 	 ions 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 requir 	 ement 	 s 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	should	be	 present 	 ed 	 	 factual 	 ly 	 	,	 straight 	 forward 	 ly 	 	,	with	no	 part 	 icular 	 	spin	,	to	all	of	the	children	in	the	country	.
And	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	you	teach	them	that	,	you	can	teach	them	 any 	 thing 	 	else	you	like	.
That	,	I	think	,	is	 maxim 	 al 	 	 toler 	 ance 	 	for	religious	 free 	 dom 	 	.
 A 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	you	inform	your	children	about	other	 relig 	 ions 	 	,	then	you	may	--	and	 a 	 s 	 	early	 a 	 s 	 	you	like	and	 what 	 ever 	 	you	like	--	teach	them	 what 	 ever 	 	 cre 	 ed 	 	you	want	them	to	learn	.
But	 al 	 so 	 	let	them	know	about	other	 relig 	 ions 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	why	do	I	say	that	?
 Be 	 cause 	 	 demo 	 cracy 	 	 depend 	 s 	 	on	an	 inform 	 ed 	 	 citizen 	 ship 	 	.
 In 	 form 	 ed 	 	consent	is	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 bed 	 rock 	 	of	our	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	 demo 	 cracy 	 	.
 Mi 	 s 	 inform 	 ed 	 	consent	is	not	worth	it	.
It	's	like	a	 co 	 in 	 	flip	;	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	count	 re 	 ally 	 	.
 Demo 	 cracy 	 	 depend 	 s 	 	on	 inform 	 ed 	 	consent	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	way	we	treat	people	 a 	 s 	 	 respons 	 ible 	 	 adult 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	children	 be 	 low 	 	the	age	of	consent	are	a	special	case	.
I	'm	going	to	use	a	word	that	 Past 	 or 	 	Rick	just	used	--	 parent 	 s 	 	are	 steward 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	children	.
 The 	 y 	 	do	n't	own	them	.
You	ca	n't	own	your	children	.
You	have	a	 respons 	 ibility 	 	to	the	world	,	to	the	state	,	to	them	,	to	take	care	of	them	right	.
You	may	teach	them	 what 	 ever 	 	 cre 	 ed 	 	you	think	is	most	 import 	 ant 	 	,	but	I	say	you	have	a	 respons 	 ibility 	 	to	let	them	be	 inform 	 ed 	 	about	all	the	other	 cre 	 ed 	 s 	 	in	the	world	,	too	.
The	reason	I	've	taken	 th 	 is 	 	time	is	I	've	 be 	 en 	 	 fascinate 	 d 	 	to	hear	some	of	the	 react 	 ions 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	.
One	 review 	 er 	 	for	a	 Ro 	 man 	 	Catholic	 news 	 paper 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	it	``	 total 	 itarian 	 	.	''
It	 strike 	 s 	 	me	 a 	 s 	 	 practical 	 ly 	 	libertarian	.
 I 	 s 	 	it	 total 	 itarian 	 	to	 requir 	 e 	 	 read 	 ing 	 	,	writing	and	arithmetic	?
I	do	n't	think	so	.
All	I	'm	 say 	 ing 	 	is	--	 fact 	 s 	 	.	 Fact 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	.
No	 value 	 s 	 	,	just	 fact 	 s 	 	about	all	the	world	's	 relig 	 ions 	 	.
 An 	 other 	 	 review 	 er 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	it	``	hilarious	.	''
Well	,	I	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 both 	 er 	 ed 	 	by	the	fact	that	 any 	 body 	 	would	think	that	was	hilarious	.
It	 seem 	 s 	 	to	me	to	be	 s 	 uch 	 	a	plausible	,	natural	 extens 	 ion 	 	of	the	 democrat 	 ic 	 	 principle 	 s 	 	we	 al 	 ready 	 	have	,	that	I	'm	 shock 	 ed 	 	to	think	 any 	 body 	 	would	find	that	just	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	.
I	know	 man 	 y 	 	 relig 	 ions 	 	are	so	 anx 	 ious 	 	about	 pre 	 serv 	 ing 	 	the	 pur 	 ity 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	faith	among	 the 	 ir 	 	children	that	they	are	intent	on	 keep 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	children	 ignor 	 ant 	 	of	other	 faith 	 s 	 	.
I	do	n't	think	that	's	 def 	 en 	 s 	 ible 	 	,	but	I	'd	 re 	 ally 	 	be	 pleas 	 ed 	 	to	get	your	 answer 	 s 	 	on	that	--	any	 react 	 ions 	 	to	that	--	 lat 	 er 	 	.
But	now	I	'm	going	to	move	on	.
Back	to	the	cow	.
 Th 	 is 	 	picture	,	which	I	 pull 	 ed 	 	off	the	web	--	the	fellow	on	the	left	is	 re 	 ally 	 	an	 import 	 ant 	 	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	picture	.
That	's	the	steward	.
 Cow 	 s 	 	could	n't	live	 with 	 out 	 	human	 steward 	 s 	 	--	they	're	 domestic 	 ated 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	a	sort	of	ectosymbiont	.
 The 	 y 	 	depend	on	us	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 surviv 	 al 	 	.
And	 Past 	 or 	 	Rick	was	just	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	sheep	.
I	'm	going	to	talk	about	sheep	,	too	.
There	's	a	lot	of	serendipitous	 converg 	 ence 	 	here	.
How	clever	it	was	of	sheep	to	 acquir 	 e 	 	 shepherd 	 s 	 	!
Think	of	what	 th 	 is 	 	got	them	.
 The 	 y 	 	could	 out 	 source 	 	all	 the 	 ir 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	--	 protect 	 ion 	 	from	 predator 	 s 	 	,	food	 find 	 ing 	 	,	health	maintenance	.
The	 on 	 ly 	 	cost	in	most	 flock 	 s 	 	is	a	loss	of	free	 mat 	 ing 	 	.
What	a	deal	.
``	How	clever	of	sheep	!	''	you	might	say	.
 Ex 	 cept 	 	,	of	course	,	it	was	n't	the	sheep	's	 clever 	 ness 	 	.
We	all	know	sheep	are	not	 exact 	 ly 	 	rocket	 scientist 	 s 	 	--	they	're	not	 ver 	 y 	 	smart	.
It	was	n't	the	 clever 	 ness 	 	of	the	sheep	at	all	.
 The 	 y 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 clue 	 less 	 	.
But	it	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	clever	move	.
 W 	 hose 	 	clever	move	was	it	?
It	was	a	clever	move	of	natural	 s 	 election 	 	 it 	 self 	 	.

 N 	 ow 	 	,	that	is	not	Intelligent	Design	--	not	from	Francis	 C 	 rick 	 	.
Evolution	is	 clever 	 er 	 	than	you	are	.
If	you	understand	 Or 	 gel 	 	's	Second	 Ru 	 le 	 	,	then	you	understand	why	the	Intelligent	Design	 move 	 ment 	 	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	a	hoax	.
The	 design 	 s 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	by	the	process	of	natural	 s 	 election 	 	are	 brilli 	 ant 	 	,	 un 	 believ 	 ably 	 	 brilli 	 ant 	 	.
 Aga 	 in 	 	and	 aga 	 in 	 	 biologist 	 s 	 	are	 fascinate 	 d 	 	with	the	 brilli 	 ance 	 	of	what	's	 discover 	 ed 	 	.
But	the	process	 it 	 self 	 	is	 with 	 out 	 	purpose	,	 with 	 out 	 	 fore 	 sight 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	design	.
When	I	was	here	four	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	I	told	the	story	about	an	ant	 climb 	 ing 	 	a	blade	of	grass	.
And	why	was	the	ant	 do 	 ing 	 	it	?
Well	,	it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	 it 	 s 	 	brain	had	 be 	 en 	 	 infect 	 ed 	 	with	a	 lance 	 t 	 	 flu 	 ke 	 	that	was	--	 need 	 ed 	 	to	get	 in 	 to 	 	the	 bel 	 ly 	 	of	a	sheep	or	a	cow	in	order	to	 re 	 produce 	 	.
It	was	sort	of	a	 s 	 pooky 	 	story	.
And	I	think	some	people	may	have	 mis 	 under 	 stood 	 	.
 L 	 ance 	 t 	 	 flu 	 ke 	 s 	 	are	n't	smart	.
I	submit	that	the	 intellig 	 ence 	 	of	a	 lance 	 t 	 	 flu 	 ke 	 	is	down	there	 some 	 where 	 	between	petunia	and	carrot	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	not	 re 	 ally 	 	bright	.	 The 	 y 	 	do	n't	have	to	be	.
The	 less 	 on 	 	we	learn	from	 th 	 is 	 	is	you	do	n't	have	to	have	a	mind	to	be	a	 benefici 	 ary 	 	.
The	design	is	there	in	nature	,	but	it	's	not	in	 any 	 body 	 	's	head	.
It	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	to	be	.
That	's	the	way	evolution	 work 	 s 	 	.
The	question	--	was	 domestic 	 ation 	 	good	for	sheep	?
It	was	great	for	 the 	 ir 	 	genetic	 fit 	 ness 	 	.
And	here	I	want	to	 re 	 mind 	 	you	of	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	point	that	Paul	 Mac 	 C 	 ready 	 	made	at	TED	three	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
 He 	 re 	 	's	what	he	 s 	 aid 	 	.
10,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	at	the	dawn	of	 agricultur 	 e 	 	,	human	population	,	plus	 live 	 stock 	 	and	 pet 	 s 	 	,	was	 approximate 	 ly 	 	a	tenth	of	one	per	cent	of	the	terrestrial	 vertebra 	 e 	 	 land 	 mass 	 	.
That	was	just	10,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
 Yes 	 ter 	 day 	 	,	in	 bio 	 logical 	 	 term 	 s 	 	.
What	is	it	 to 	 day 	 	?	 Do 	 es 	 	 any 	 body 	 	remember	what	he	told	us	?
98	percent	.
That	is	what	we	have	 d 	 one 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	I	 talk 	 ed 	 	to	Paul	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	.
I	 want 	 ed 	 	to	check	to	find	out	how	he	'd	 calcul 	 ated 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	get	the	 source 	 s 	 	and	so	forth	.
And	he	 g 	 ave 	 	me	a	paper	that	he	had	written	on	 th 	 is 	 	.
There	was	a	 pass 	 age 	 	in	it	which	he	did	not	present	here	and	I	think	it	is	so	good	I	'm	going	to	read	it	to	you	.
``	Over	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	on	a	 un 	 ique 	 	sphere	,	chance	 ha 	 s 	 	 paint 	 ed 	 	a	thin	 cover 	 ing 	 	of	life	:	complex	,	 im 	 prob 	 able 	 	,	 wonder 	 ful 	 	and	fragile	.

We	heard	about	the	atmosphere	 a 	 s 	 	a	thin	layer	of	 var 	 nish 	 	.
Life	 it 	 self 	 	is	just	a	thin	coat	of	paint	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	.
And	we	're	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	hold	the	 paint 	 brush 	 	.
And	how	can	we	do	that	?
The	key	to	our	 domin 	 ation 	 	of	the	planet	is	culture	,	and	the	key	to	culture	is	 relig 	 ion 	 	.
 Sup 	 pose 	 	 Mart 	 ian 	 	 scientist 	 s 	 	came	to	Earth	.
 The 	 y 	 	would	be	 puzzl 	 ed 	 	by	 man 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 Any 	 body 	 	know	what	 th 	 is 	 	is	?
I	'll	tell	you	what	it	is	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	million	people	 gather 	 ing 	 	on	the	 bank 	 s 	 	of	the	 Gan 	 ge 	 s 	 	in	2001	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	the	largest	single	 gather 	 ing 	 	of	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	ever	,	 a 	 s 	 	 s 	 een 	 	from	satellite	photograph	.

 He 	 re 	 	's	 an 	 other 	 	crowd	in	Mecca	.
 Mart 	 ians 	 	would	be	 amaz 	 ed 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	'd	want	to	know	how	it	 origin 	 ated 	 	,	what	it	was	for	and	how	it	 perpetu 	 ates 	 	 it 	 self 	 	.
 Actu 	 ally 	 	,	I	'm	going	to	pass	over	 th 	 is 	 	.
The	ant	is	n't	 al 	 one 	 	.
There	's	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 case 	 s 	 	of	species	.
In	that	case	,	a	 parasit 	 e 	 	 get 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	mouse	and	it	 need 	 s 	 	to	get	 in 	 to 	 	the	 bel 	 ly 	 	of	a	cat	.
And	it	 turn 	 s 	 	the	mouse	 in 	 to 	 	 Might 	 y 	 	 Mo 	 use 	 	--	it	 make 	 s 	 	it	 fear 	 less 	 	,	so	it	 run 	 s 	 	out	in	the	open	,	where	it	'll	be	eaten	by	a	cat	.
 Tru 	 e 	 	story	.
In	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	we	have	these	 hijack 	 ers 	 	--	you	've	 s 	 een 	 	 th 	 is 	 	slide	before	,	from	four	 year 	 s 	 	ago	--	a	 parasit 	 e 	 	that	 infect 	 s 	 	the	brain	and	 induce 	 s 	 	even	 sui 	 cidal 	 	behavior	on	 be 	 half 	 	of	a	cause	other	than	one	's	own	genetic	 fit 	 ness 	 	.
 Do 	 es 	 	that	ever	happen	to	us	?
Yes	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	--	 quit 	 e 	 	 wonder 	 fully 	 	.
The	 Arab 	 ic 	 	word	``	Islam	''	 mean 	 s 	 	``	 sub 	 mission 	 	.	''
It	 mean 	 s 	 	``	surrender	of	 self 	 - 	 interest 	 	to	the	will	of	 A 	 llah 	 	.	''
But	I	'm	not	just	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	Islam	.
I	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	 al 	 so 	 	about	 Christ 	 ian 	 ity 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	 par 	 ch 	 ment 	 	music	page	that	I	found	in	a	Paris	 book 	 stall 	 	50	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
And	on	it	it	 say 	 s 	 	,	in	 Lat 	 in 	 	:	``	 Se 	 men 	 	est	 verb 	 um 	 	 De 	 i 	 	.	 S 	 ator 	 	 aut 	 em 	 	 Christ 	 us 	 	.
The	word	of	God	is	the	seed	and	the	 s 	 ow 	 er 	 	of	the	seed	is	Christ	.	''
 Sam 	 e 	 	idea	!	Well	,	not	 quit 	 e 	 	.
But	in	fact	,	 Christ 	 ians 	 	,	too	,	 glor 	 y 	 	in	the	fact	that	they	have	 surrender 	 ed 	 	to	God	.
I	'll	give	you	a	few	 quote 	 s 	 	.
``	The	heart	of	worship	is	surrender	.
 Sur 	 render 	 ed 	 	people	obey	God	's	 word 	 s 	 	,	even	if	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	sense	.	''
 T 	 hose 	 	 word 	 s 	 	are	by	Rick	 War 	 ren 	 	.
 T 	 hose 	 	are	from	``	The	 Pur 	 pose 	 	 Driv 	 en 	 	Life	.	''
And	I	want	to	turn	now	,	 brief 	 ly 	 	,	to	talk	about	that	book	,	which	I	've	read	.
You	've	all	got	a	copy	.
You	've	just	heard	the	man	.
And	what	I	want	to	do	now	is	say	a	bit	about	 th 	 is 	 	book	from	the	design	 stand 	 point 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	I	think	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 brilli 	 ant 	 	book	.
First	of	all	,	the	goal	.
And	you	heard	just	now	what	the	goal	is	.
It	's	to	 br 	 ing 	 	purpose	to	the	 live 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	,	and	he	 ha 	 s 	 	 succeed 	 ed 	 	.
 I 	 s 	 	it	a	good	goal	?
In	 it 	 self 	 	,	I	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	we	all	agree	,	it	is	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	goal	.
He	's	 absolute 	 ly 	 	right	.
There	are	 lot 	 s 	 	of	people	out	there	who	do	n't	have	purpose	in	 the 	 ir 	 	life	,	and	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	purpose	to	 the 	 ir 	 	life	is	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	goal	.
I	give	him	an	 A 	  	  	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	.
 I 	 s 	 	the	goal	 achiev 	 ed 	 	?
Yes	.
30	million	copies	of	 th 	 is 	 	book	.
Al	 Go 	 re 	 	,	eat	your	heart	out	.
Just	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	Al	is	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	,	Rick	is	 do 	 ing 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	fantastic	 achiev 	 ement 	 	.
And	,	the	 mean 	 s 	 	--	how	 do 	 es 	 	he	do	it	?
It	's	a	 brilli 	 ant 	 	 re 	 design 	 	of	 tradition 	 al 	 	religious	 theme 	 s 	 	--	 up 	 d 	 ating 	 	them	,	 quiet 	 ly 	 	dropping	 obsolet 	 e 	 	 feature 	 s 	 	,	 put 	 ting 	 	new	 interpret 	 ations 	 	on	other	 feature 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	evolution	of	 relig 	 ion 	 	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	going	on	for	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	he	's	just	the	 lat 	 est 	 	 brilli 	 ant 	 	practitioner	of	it	.
I	do	n't	have	to	tell	you	 th 	 is 	 	.
You	've	just	heard	the	man	.
 Excel 	 lent 	 	 in 	 sight 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	human	 psycho 	 logy 	 	,	wise	 ad 	 vice 	 	on	every	page	.
 Mo 	 re 	 over 	 	,	he	 invit 	 es 	 	us	to	look	under	the	hood	.
I	 re 	 ally 	 	 appreciate 	 d 	 	that	.
For	 in 	 stance 	 	,	he	 ha 	 s 	 	an	 append 	 ix 	 	where	he	 explain 	 s 	 	his	choice	of	 transl 	 ations 	 	of	different	Bible	 verse 	 s 	 	.
The	book	is	clear	,	 vivi 	 d 	 	,	 access 	 ible 	 	,	 beaut 	 i 	 fully 	 	 format 	 ted 	 	.
Just	 en 	 ough 	 	 re 	 petition 	 	.
That	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.

Every	time	you	read	it	or	say	it	,	you	make	 an 	 other 	 	copy	in	your	brain	.
With	me	,	 every 	 body 	 	--	every	time	you	read	it	or	say	it	,	you	make	 an 	 other 	 	copy	in	your	brain	.
Thank	you	.
And	now	we	come	to	my	problem	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	I	'm	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 since 	 re 	 	in	my	 appreci 	 ation 	 	of	all	that	I	've	 s 	 aid 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	book	.
But	I	wish	it	 we 	 re 	 	better	.
I	have	some	 problem 	 s 	 	with	the	book	.
And	it	would	just	be	 in 	 since 	 re 	 	of	me	not	to	address	 t 	 hose 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	.
I	wish	he	could	do	 th 	 is 	 	with	a	 re 	 vision 	 	,	a	Mark	2	version	of	his	book	.
``	The	truth	will	set	you	free	''	--	that	's	what	it	 say 	 s 	 	in	the	Bible	,	and	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	that	I	want	to	live	by	,	too	.
My	problem	is	,	some	of	the	bits	in	it	I	do	n't	think	are	true	.
 N 	 ow 	 	some	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	of	opinion	,	and	that	's	not	my	main	 complain 	 t 	 	.
That	's	worth	 ment 	 ion 	 ing 	 	.
 He 	 re 	 	's	a	 pass 	 age 	 	--	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	much	what	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	 any 	 way 	 	.
``	If	there	was	no	God	we	would	all	be	 accident 	 s 	 	,	the	result	of	astronomical	random	chance	in	the	 Univers 	 e 	 	.
You	could	stop	 read 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	book	 be 	 cause 	 	life	would	have	no	purpose	or	meaning	or	 sign 	 ific 	 ance 	 	.
There	would	be	no	right	or	wrong	and	no	hope	beyond	your	brief	 year 	 s 	 	on	Earth	.	''
 N 	 ow 	 	,	I	just	do	not	 believ 	 e 	 	that	.
By	the	way	,	I	find	 Hom 	 er 	 	 Groen 	 ing 	 	's	film	 present 	 ed 	 	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 alter 	 native 	 	to	that	 ver 	 y 	 	claim	.
Yes	,	there	is	meaning	and	a	reason	for	right	or	wrong	.
We	do	n't	need	a	belief	in	God	to	be	good	or	to	have	meaning	in	us	.
But	that	is	just	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	of	opinion	.
That	's	not	what	I	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 worri 	 ed 	 	about	.
How	about	 th 	 is 	 	--	``	God	designed	 th 	 is 	 	planet	's	environment	just	so	we	could	live	in	it	.	''
I	'm	 af 	 raid 	 	that	a	lot	of	people	take	that	sentiment	to	mean	that	we	do	n't	have	to	do	the	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	Al	 Go 	 re 	 	is	 try 	 ing 	 	so	hard	to	get	us	to	do	.
I	'm	not	happy	with	that	sentiment	at	all	.
And	then	I	find	 th 	 is 	 	--	``	All	the	evidence	 avail 	 able 	 	in	the	 bio 	 logical 	 	 science 	 s 	 	 support 	 s 	 	the	core	 pro 	 position 	 	that	the	 cosmo 	 s 	 	is	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	designed	whole	with	life	and	 man 	 kind 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	fundamental	goal	and	purpose	,	a	whole	in	which	all	 facet 	 s 	 	of	 re 	 ality 	 	have	 the 	 ir 	 	meaning	and	 explan 	 ation 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	central	fact	.	''
Well	,	that	's	Michael	 Den 	 ton 	 	.	He	's	a	 creation 	 ist 	 	.
And	here	I	think	,	``	Wait	a	minute	.	''
I	read	 th 	 is 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.
I	read	it	three	or	four	 time 	 s 	 	and	I	think	,	``	 I 	 s 	 	he	 re 	 ally 	 	 end 	 ors 	 ing 	 	intelligent	design	?
 I 	 s 	 	he	 end 	 ors 	 ing 	 	 creation 	 ism 	 	here	?	''
And	you	ca	n't	tell	.
So	I	'm	sort	of	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	Well	,	I	do	n't	know	,	I	do	n't	know	if	I	want	to	get	 up 	 set 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	yet	.	''
But	then	I	read	on	and	I	read	 th 	 is 	 	:	``	First	,	 No 	 ah 	 	had	never	 s 	 een 	 	rain	,	 be 	 cause 	 	prior	to	the	flood	God	 irrig 	 ated 	 	the	earth	from	the	ground	up	.	''
I	wish	that	sentence	 we 	 re 	 	n't	in	there	,	 be 	 cause 	 	I	think	it	is	false	.
And	I	think	that	 think 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	way	about	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	the	planet	,	after	we	've	just	 be 	 en 	 	 hear 	 ing 	 	about	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	the	planet	over	 million 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	 dis 	 courage 	 s 	 	people	from	scientific	 understand 	 ing 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	Rick	 War 	 ren 	 	uses	scientific	 term 	 s 	 	and	scientific	 fact 	 oid 	 s 	 	and	information	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	way	.
 He 	 re 	 	's	one	:	``	God	 de 	 liberate 	 ly 	 	shaped	and	 form 	 ed 	 	you	to	serve	him	in	a	way	that	 make 	 s 	 	your	 mini 	 stry 	 	 un 	 ique 	 	.
He	 care 	 fully 	 	 mix 	 ed 	 	the	DNA	 cock 	 tail 	 	that	 create 	 d 	 	you	.	''
I	think	that	's	false	.
 N 	 ow 	 	 may 	 be 	 	we	want	to	treat	it	 a 	 s 	 	 metaphor 	 ical 	 	.
 He 	 re 	 	's	 an 	 other 	 	one	--	``	For	 in 	 stance 	 	,	your	brain	can	store	100	trillion	 fact 	 s 	 	.
Your	mind	can	handle	15,000	 decision 	 s 	 	a	second	.	''
Well	,	it	would	be	 interest 	 ing 	 	to	find	the	 interpret 	 ation 	 	where	I	would	accept	that	.
There	might	be	some	way	of	 treat 	 ing 	 	that	 a 	 s 	 	true	.
``	 Anthropo 	 logists 	 	have	 not 	 ed 	 	that	worship	is	a	universal	urge	,	 hard 	 wired 	 	by	God	 in 	 to 	 	the	 ver 	 y 	 	fiber	of	our	 be 	 ing 	 	,	an	 in 	 built 	 	need	to	connect	with	God	.	''
Well	,	there	's	a	sense	which	I	agree	with	him	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	I	think	it	 ha 	 s 	 	an	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 explan 	 ation 	 	.
And	what	I	find	 deep 	 ly 	 	 trou 	 bling 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	book	is	that	he	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	 argu 	 ing 	 	that	if	you	want	to	be	moral	,	if	you	want	to	have	meaning	in	your	life	,	you	have	to	be	an	Intelligent	 Design 	 er 	 	--	you	have	to	 den 	 y 	 	the	 theor 	 y 	 	of	evolution	by	natural	 s 	 election 	 	.
And	I	think	,	on	the	 contr 	 ary 	 	,	that	it	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	solving	the	world	's	 problem 	 s 	 	that	we	take	 evolution 	 ary 	 	biology	 serious 	 ly 	 	.
 W 	 hose 	 	truth	are	we	going	to	listen	to	?
Well	,	 th 	 is 	 	from	``	The	 Pur 	 pose 	 	 Driv 	 en 	 	Life	''	--	``	The	Bible	must	 be 	 come 	 	the	 author 	 itative 	 	standard	for	my	life	,	the	compass	I	 re 	 ly 	 	on	for	direction	,	the	counsel	I	listen	to	for	making	wise	 decision 	 s 	 	and	the	 bench 	 mark 	 	I	use	for	 evalu 	 ating 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	.	''
Well	 may 	 be 	 	,	 O 	 K 	 	,	but	what	's	going	to	follow	from	 th 	 is 	 	?
And	here	's	one	that	 do 	 es 	 	concern	me	.
 Re 	 member 	 	I	 quote 	 d 	 	him	before	with	 th 	 is 	 	line	--	``	 Sur 	 render 	 ed 	 	people	obey	God	's	word	,	even	if	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	sense	.	''

 C 	 hole 	 ra 	 	was	 report 	 ed 	 	in	Haiti	for	the	first	time	in	over	50	 year 	 s 	 	last	 Oct 	 ob 	 er 	 	.
There	was	no	way	to	predict	how	far	it	would	spread	through	water	 suppli 	 es 	 	and	how	bad	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	would	get	.
And	not	 know 	 ing 	 	where	help	was	 need 	 ed 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	 ensure 	 d 	 	that	help	was	in	short	supply	in	the	 area 	 s 	 	that	 need 	 ed 	 	it	most	.
We	've	gotten	good	at	 predict 	 ing 	 	and	 pre 	 par 	 ing 	 	for	 storm 	 s 	 	before	they	take	 innoc 	 ent 	 	 live 	 s 	 	and	cause	 ir 	 revers 	 ible 	 	damage	,	but	we	still	ca	n't	do	that	with	water	,	and	here	's	why	.
Right	now	,	if	you	want	to	test	water	in	the	field	,	you	need	a	trained	technician	,	expensive	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	you	have	to	wait	about	a	day	for	chemical	 react 	 ions 	 	to	take	place	and	provide	 result 	 s 	 	.
It	's	too	 s 	 low 	 	to	get	a	picture	of	 condition 	 s 	 	on	the	ground	before	they	change	,	too	expensive	to	implement	in	all	the	 place 	 s 	 	that	 requir 	 e 	 	 test 	 ing 	 	.
And	it	 ignor 	 es 	 	the	fact	that	,	in	the	 mean 	 while 	 	,	people	still	need	to	drink	water	.
 Mo 	 st 	 	of	the	information	that	we	 collect 	 ed 	 	on	the	cholera	 out 	 break 	 	did	n't	come	from	 test 	 ing 	 	water	;	it	came	from	 form 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	which	 document 	 ed 	 	all	the	people	we	 fail 	 ed 	 	to	help	.
 Count 	 less 	 	 live 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	by	 can 	 aries 	 	in	 coal 	 mine 	 s 	 	--	a	simple	and	 in 	 valu 	 able 	 	way	for	 min 	 ers 	 	to	know	 whet 	 her 	 	they	're	safe	.
I	've	 be 	 en 	 	inspired	by	that	 simpl 	 icity 	 	 a 	 s 	 	I	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	problem	with	some	of	the	most	 hard 	 work 	 ing 	 	and	 brilli 	 ant 	 	people	I	've	ever	known	.
We	think	there	's	a	 simpl 	 er 	 	solution	to	 th 	 is 	 	problem	--	one	that	can	be	used	by	people	who	face	 condition 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	 every 	 day 	 	.
It	's	in	 it 	 s 	 	early	 stage 	 s 	 	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	right	now	.
We	call	it	the	Water	 Can 	 ary 	 	.
It	's	a	fast	,	cheap	 de 	 vice 	 	that	 answer 	 s 	 	an	 import 	 ant 	 	question	:	 I 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	water	 contami 	 nated 	 	?
It	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 requir 	 e 	 	any	special	training	.
And	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	chemical	 react 	 ions 	 	to	take	place	,	it	uses	light	.
That	 mean 	 s 	 	there	's	no	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	chemical	 react 	 ions 	 	to	take	place	,	no	need	to	use	 re 	 agent 	 s 	 	that	can	run	out	and	no	need	to	be	an	expert	to	get	 action 	 able 	 	information	.
To	test	water	,	you	 simpl 	 y 	 	insert	a	 s 	 ample 	 	and	,	 with 	 in 	 	 second 	 s 	 	,	it	either	 dis 	 play 	 s 	 	a	red	light	,	 indic 	 ating 	 	 contami 	 nated 	 	water	,	or	a	green	light	,	 indic 	 ating 	 	the	 s 	 ample 	 	is	safe	.
 Th 	 is 	 	will	make	it	possible	for	 any 	 one 	 	to	collect	 life 	 - 	 saving 	 	information	and	to	monitor	water	quality	 condition 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	 un 	 fold 	 	.
We	're	 al 	 so 	 	,	on	top	of	that	,	 integ 	 rating 	 	 wire 	 less 	 	 network 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	an	 afford 	 able 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	with	 GP 	 S 	 	and	 G 	 SM 	 	.
What	that	 mean 	 s 	 	is	that	each	 read 	 ing 	 	can	be	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	 transmit 	 ted 	 	to	 serv 	 ers 	 	to	be	 ma 	 pped 	 	in	real	time	.
With	 en 	 ough 	 	 user 	 s 	 	,	 map 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	will	make	it	possible	to	take	 prevent 	 ive 	 	action	,	 contain 	 ing 	 	 hazard 	 s 	 	before	they	turn	 in 	 to 	 	 emerge 	 ncies 	 	that	take	 year 	 s 	 	to	 re 	 cover 	 	from	.
And	then	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	taking	 day 	 s 	 	to	disseminate	 th 	 is 	 	information	to	the	people	who	need	it	most	,	it	can	happen	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	.
We	've	 s 	 een 	 	how	 distribut 	 ed 	 	 network 	 s 	 	,	big	data	and	information	can	transform	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
I	think	it	's	time	for	us	to	 app 	 ly 	 	them	to	water	.
Our	goal	over	the	next	year	is	to	get	Water	 Can 	 ary 	 	ready	for	the	field	and	to	 open 	 - 	 source 	 	the	 hard 	 ware 	 	so	that	 any 	 one 	 	can	 con 	 tribute 	 	to	the	 develop 	 ment 	 	and	the	 evalu 	 ation 	 	,	so	we	can	tackle	 th 	 is 	 	problem	together	.
Thank	you	.
The	 Hindu 	 s 	 	say	,	``	 Nad 	 a 	 	brahma	,	''	one	 transl 	 ation 	 	of	which	is	,	``	The	world	is	sound	.	''
And	in	a	way	,	that	's	true	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	is	 vib 	 rating 	 	.
In	fact	,	all	of	you	 a 	 s 	 	you	 s 	 it 	 	here	right	now	are	 vib 	 rating 	 	.
Every	part	of	your	body	is	 vib 	 rating 	 	at	different	 fr 	 equ 	 encies 	 	.
So	you	are	,	in	fact	,	a	 chor 	 d 	 	--	each	of	you	an	individual	 chor 	 d 	 	.
One	definition	of	health	may	be	that	that	 chor 	 d 	 	is	in	complete	 harmon 	 y 	 	.
Your	 ear 	 s 	 	ca	n't	hear	that	 chor 	 d 	 	;	they	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	hear	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.	Your	 ear 	 s 	 	can	hear	10	 octave 	 s 	 	.
 Inc 	 ident 	 ally 	 	,	we	see	just	one	octave	.
Your	 ear 	 s 	 	are	 al 	 ways 	 	on	--	you	have	no	ear	lids	.
 The 	 y 	 	work	even	when	you	sleep	.
The	 small 	 est 	 	sound	you	can	perceive	 move 	 s 	 	your	 ear 	 drum 	 	just	four	atomic	 dia 	 meter 	 s 	 	.
The	 loud 	 est 	 	sound	you	can	hear	is	a	trillion	 time 	 s 	 	more	 power 	 ful 	 	than	that	.
 Ear 	 s 	 	are	made	not	for	 hear 	 ing 	 	,	but	for	 listen 	 ing 	 	.
 Listen 	 ing 	 	is	an	active	skill	,	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	 hear 	 ing 	 	is	 pass 	 ive 	 	,	 listen 	 ing 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	have	to	work	at	--	it	's	a	relationship	with	sound	.
And	yet	it	's	a	skill	that	 non 	 e 	 	of	us	are	taught	.
For	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	have	you	ever	 consider 	 ed 	 	that	there	are	 listen 	 ing 	 	 position 	 s 	 	,	 place 	 s 	 	you	can	listen	from	?
 He 	 re 	 	are	two	of	them	.
 Re 	 duct 	 ive 	 	 listen 	 ing 	 	is	 listen 	 ing 	 	``	for	.	''
It	 reduc 	 es 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	down	to	what	's	relevant	and	it	 dis 	 card 	 s 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	that	's	not	relevant	.
Men	 typical 	 ly 	 	listen	 re 	 duct 	 ively 	 	.
So	he	's	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	I	've	got	 th 	 is 	 	problem	.	''
He	's	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	 He 	 re 	 	's	your	solution	.	 Thank 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.	Next	.	''
That	's	the	way	we	talk	,	right	 guy 	 s 	 	?
 Ex 	 pan 	 s 	 ive 	 	 listen 	 ing 	 	,	on	the	other	hand	,	is	 listen 	 ing 	 	``	with	,	''	not	 listen 	 ing 	 	``	for	.	''
It	's	got	no	destination	in	mind	--	it	's	just	 enjoy 	 ing 	 	the	journey	.
Women	 typical 	 ly 	 	listen	 expansive 	 ly 	 	.
If	you	look	at	these	two	,	eye	contact	,	facing	each	other	,	possibly	both	 talk 	 ing 	 	at	the	same	time	.
Men	,	if	you	get	 noth 	 ing 	 	else	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	talk	,	practice	expansive	 listen 	 ing 	 	,	and	you	can	transform	your	 relationship 	 s 	 	.
The	trouble	with	 listen 	 ing 	 	is	that	so	much	of	what	we	hear	is	noise	,	 surround 	 ing 	 	us	all	the	time	.
 No 	 ise 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	the	European	 Un 	 ion 	 	,	is	 reduc 	 ing 	 	the	health	and	the	quality	of	life	of	25	percent	of	the	population	of	 Euro 	 pe 	 	.
Two	percent	of	the	population	of	 Euro 	 pe 	 	--	that	's	16	million	people	--	are	 hav 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	sleep	 deva 	 state 	 d 	 	by	noise	like	that	.
 No 	 ise 	 	 kill 	 s 	 	200,000	people	a	year	in	 Euro 	 pe 	 	.
It	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	big	problem	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	when	you	 we 	 re 	 	little	,	if	you	had	noise	and	you	did	n't	want	to	hear	it	,	you	'd	stick	your	 finger 	 s 	 	in	your	 ear 	 s 	 	and	hum	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	 day 	 s 	 	,	you	can	do	a	similar	thing	,	it	just	 look 	 s 	 	a	bit	 cool 	 er 	 	.
It	 look 	 s 	 	a	bit	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
The	trouble	with	 wide 	 spread 	 	 head 	 phone 	 	use	is	it	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	three	 re 	 ally 	 	big	health	 issue 	 s 	 	.
The	first	 re 	 ally 	 	big	health	issue	is	a	word	that	 Mur 	 ray 	 	 Sch 	 af 	 er 	 	 co 	 in 	 ed 	 	:	``	 schizo 	 phon 	 ia 	 	.	''
It	's	a	 dis 	 location 	 	between	what	you	see	and	what	you	hear	.
So	,	we	're	 invit 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	our	 live 	 s 	 	the	 voice 	 s 	 	of	people	who	are	not	present	with	us	.
I	think	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	 deep 	 ly 	 	 un 	 health 	 y 	 	about	living	all	the	time	in	 schizo 	 phon 	 ia 	 	.
The	second	problem	that	 come 	 s 	 	with	 head 	 phone 	 	abuse	is	 compress 	 ion 	 	.
We	squash	music	to	fit	it	 in 	 to 	 	our	pocket	and	there	is	a	cost	 attach 	 ed 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	.
Listen	to	 th 	 is 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 un 	 compress 	 ed 	 	piece	of	music	.
And	now	the	same	piece	of	music	with	98	percent	of	the	data	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	.
I	do	hope	that	some	of	you	at	 l 	 east 	 	can	hear	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	 t 	 hose 	 	two	.
There	is	a	cost	of	 compress 	 ion 	 	.
It	 make 	 s 	 	you	 tire 	 d 	 	and	 irrit 	 able 	 	to	have	to	make	up	all	of	that	data	.
You	're	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	imagine	it	.
It	's	not	good	for	you	in	the	long	run	.
The	third	problem	with	 head 	 phone 	 s 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	:	 deaf 	 ness 	 	--	 noise 	 - 	 induced 	 	 hear 	 ing 	 	 dis 	 order 	 	.
Ten	million	 American 	 s 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	have	 th 	 is 	 	for	one	reason	or	 an 	 other 	 	,	but	 re 	 ally 	 	 worry 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	16	percent	--	 rough 	 ly 	 	one	in	six	--	of	American	 teenager 	 s 	 	suffer	from	 noise 	 - 	 induced 	 	 hear 	 ing 	 	 dis 	 order 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	of	 head 	 phone 	 	abuse	.
One	 stud 	 y 	 	at	an	American	university	found	that	61	percent	of	college	 fresh 	 men 	 	had	 damage 	 d 	 	 hear 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	of	 head 	 phone 	 	abuse	.
We	may	be	raising	an	entire	generation	of	deaf	people	.
 N 	 ow 	 	that	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	serious	problem	.
I	'll	give	you	three	quick	 tip 	 s 	 	to	protect	your	 ear 	 s 	 	and	pass	these	on	to	your	children	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	.
 Profess 	 ional 	 	 hear 	 ing 	 	 protect 	 ors 	 	are	great	;	I	use	some	all	the	time	.
If	you	're	going	to	use	 head 	 phone 	 s 	 	,	buy	the	best	 one 	 s 	 	you	can	afford	 be 	 cause 	 	quality	 mean 	 s 	 	you	do	n't	have	to	have	it	so	loud	.
If	you	ca	n't	hear	 some 	 body 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	you	in	a	loud	voice	,	it	's	too	loud	.
And	 third 	 ly 	 	,	if	you	're	in	bad	sound	,	it	's	fine	to	put	your	 finger 	 s 	 	in	your	 ear 	 s 	 	or	just	move	away	from	it	.
Protect	your	 ear 	 s 	 	in	that	way	.
Let	's	move	away	from	bad	sound	and	look	at	some	 friend 	 s 	 	that	I	urge	you	to	seek	out	.
 WW 	 B 	 	:	Wind	,	water	,	 bird 	 s 	 	--	 stochas 	 tic 	 	natural	 sound 	 s 	 	 compose 	 d 	 	of	 lot 	 s 	 	of	individual	random	 event 	 s 	 	,	all	of	it	 ver 	 y 	 	 health 	 y 	 	,	all	of	it	sound	that	we	 evolv 	 ed 	 	to	over	the	 year 	 s 	 	.
Seek	 t 	 hose 	 	 sound 	 s 	 	out	;	they	're	good	for	you	and	so	it	 th 	 is 	 	.
 Sil 	 ence 	 	is	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
The	 Elizabeth 	 an 	 s 	 	 de 	 scribed 	 	language	 a 	 s 	 	 decor 	 ated 	 	silence	.
I	urge	you	to	move	away	from	silence	with	 intent 	 ion 	 	and	to	design	 sound 	 scapes 	 	just	like	 work 	 s 	 	of	art	.
 Hav 	 e 	 	a	 fore 	 ground 	 	,	a	 back 	 ground 	 	,	all	in	 beaut 	 iful 	 	proportion	.
It	's	 f 	 un 	 	to	get	 in 	 to 	 	 design 	 ing 	 	with	sound	.
If	you	ca	n't	do	it	 your 	 self 	 	,	get	a	professional	to	do	it	for	you	.
Sound	design	is	the	future	,	and	I	think	it	's	the	way	we	're	going	to	change	the	way	the	world	 sound 	 s 	 	.
I	'm	going	to	just	run	 quick 	 ly 	 	through	eight	 mod 	 al 	 ities 	 	,	eight	ways	sound	can	improve	health	.
First	,	 ultra 	 sound 	 	:	we	're	 ver 	 y 	 	familiar	with	it	from	physical	therapy	;	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	now	 be 	 ing 	 	used	to	treat	cancer	.
Lithotripsy	--	saving	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	a	year	from	the	 scalp 	 el 	 	by	 pul 	 ver 	 izing 	 	 stone 	 s 	 	with	 high 	 - 	 intens 	 ity 	 	sound	.
Sound	 heal 	 ing 	 	is	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 mod 	 ality 	 	.
It	's	 be 	 en 	 	around	for	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
I	do	urge	you	to	explore	 th 	 is 	 	.
There	are	great	 thing 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 d 	 one 	 	there	,	 treat 	 ing 	 	now	 aut 	 ism 	 	,	 de 	 ment 	 ia 	 	and	other	 condition 	 s 	 	.
And	music	,	of	course	.	Just	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	music	is	good	for	you	,	if	it	's	music	that	's	made	with	good	 intent 	 ion 	 	,	made	with	love	,	 general 	 ly 	 	.
 De 	 vot 	 ional 	 	music	,	good	--	 Mo 	 z 	 art 	 	,	good	.
There	are	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 type 	 s 	 	of	music	that	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 health 	 y 	 	.
And	four	 mod 	 al 	 ities 	 	where	you	need	to	take	some	action	and	get	 involve 	 d 	 	.
First	of	all	,	listen	 conscious 	 ly 	 	.
I	hope	that	that	after	 th 	 is 	 	talk	you	'll	be	 do 	 ing 	 	that	.
It	's	a	whole	new	dimension	to	your	life	and	it	's	 wonder 	 ful 	 	to	have	that	dimension	.
 Second 	 ly 	 	,	get	in	touch	with	making	some	sound	--	create	sound	.
The	voice	is	the	instrument	we	all	play	,	and	yet	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	us	are	trained	in	using	our	voice	?	Get	trained	;	learn	to	 s 	 ing 	 	,	learn	to	play	an	instrument	.
 Music 	 ians 	 	have	 big 	 ger 	 	 brain 	 s 	 	--	it	's	true	.
You	can	do	 th 	 is 	 	in	 group 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
It	's	a	fantastic	antidote	to	 schizo 	 phon 	 ia 	 	;	to	make	music	and	sound	in	a	group	of	people	,	 which 	 ever 	 	style	you	enjoy	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	.
And	let	's	take	a	 steward 	 ing 	 	role	for	the	sound	around	us	.
Protect	your	 ear 	 s 	 	?	Yes	,	 absolute 	 ly 	 	.
Design	 sound 	 scapes 	 	to	be	 beaut 	 iful 	 	around	you	at	home	and	at	work	.
And	let	's	start	to	speak	up	when	people	are	 ass 	 ailing 	 	us	with	the	noise	that	I	 play 	 ed 	 	you	early	on	.
So	I	'm	going	to	 leav 	 e 	 	you	with	seven	 thing 	 s 	 	you	can	do	right	now	to	improve	your	health	with	sound	.
My	vision	is	of	a	world	that	 sound 	 s 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	and	if	we	all	start	 do 	 ing 	 	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	we	will	take	a	 ver 	 y 	 	big	step	in	that	direction	.
So	I	urge	you	to	take	that	path	.
I	'm	 leav 	 ing 	 	you	with	a	little	more	 bird 	 song 	 	,	which	is	 ver 	 y 	 	good	for	you	.
I	wish	you	sound	health	.
I	want	to	ask	you	all	to	consider	for	a	second	the	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	fact	that	,	by	far	,	most	of	what	we	know	about	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 come 	 s 	 	to	us	from	light	.
We	can	stand	on	the	Earth	and	look	up	at	the	night	sky	and	see	 star 	 s 	 	with	our	bare	 eye 	 s 	 	.
The	Sun	 burn 	 s 	 	our	 per 	 iph 	 er 	 al 	 	vision	.
We	see	light	 reflect 	 ed 	 	off	the	 Mo 	 on 	 	.
And	in	the	time	since	 Gal 	 ile 	 o 	 	 point 	 ed 	 	that	 rud 	 imentary 	 	 tele 	 scope 	 	at	the	 ce 	 les 	 tial 	 	bodies	,	the	known	 uni 	 verse 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	come	to	us	through	light	,	 a 	 cross 	 	vast	 era 	 s 	 	in	 cosm 	 ic 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
And	with	all	of	our	modern	 tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	,	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	collect	 th 	 is 	 	 stunn 	 ing 	 	silent	movie	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	--	these	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 snap 	 shot 	 s 	 	that	go	all	the	way	back	to	the	Big	Bang	.
And	yet	,	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	not	a	silent	movie	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	n't	silent	.
I	'd	like	to	 con 	 vince 	 	you	that	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 sound 	 track 	 	and	that	 sound 	 track 	 	is	 play 	 ed 	 	on	space	 it 	 self 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	space	can	 wo 	 bble 	 	like	a	drum	.
It	can	ring	out	a	kind	of	 record 	 ing 	 	 through 	 out 	 	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	of	some	of	the	most	 dramat 	 ic 	 	 event 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	 un 	 fold 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	we	'd	like	to	be	able	to	add	to	a	kind	of	 glor 	 ious 	 	visual	 com 	 position 	 	that	we	have	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	--	a	sonic	 com 	 position 	 	.
And	while	we	've	never	heard	the	 sound 	 s 	 	from	space	,	we	 re 	 ally 	 	should	,	in	the	next	few	 year 	 s 	 	,	start	to	turn	up	the	volume	on	what	's	going	on	out	there	.
So	in	 th 	 is 	 	 ambit 	 ion 	 	to	capture	 song 	 s 	 	from	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	we	turn	our	focus	to	black	 hole 	 s 	 	and	the	promise	they	have	,	 be 	 cause 	 	black	 hole 	 s 	 	can	bang	on	 space 	 - 	 time 	 	like	 mal 	 lets 	 	on	a	drum	and	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 character 	 istic 	 	song	,	which	I	'd	like	to	play	for	you	--	some	of	our	 predict 	 ions 	 	for	what	that	song	will	be	like	.
 N 	 ow 	 	black	 hole 	 s 	 	are	dark	against	a	dark	sky	.
We	ca	n't	see	them	 direct 	 ly 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	not	 br 	 ought 	 	to	us	with	light	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	not	 direct 	 ly 	 	.
We	can	see	them	 in 	 direct 	 ly 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	black	 hole 	 s 	 	wreak	 ha 	 voc 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	environment	.
 The 	 y 	 	destroy	 star 	 s 	 	around	them	.
 The 	 y 	 	churn	up	 deb 	 ris 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 surround 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
But	they	wo	n't	come	to	us	 direct 	 ly 	 	through	light	.
We	might	one	day	see	a	shadow	a	black	hole	can	cast	on	a	 ver 	 y 	 	bright	 back 	 ground 	 	,	but	we	have	n't	yet	.
And	yet	black	 hole 	 s 	 	may	be	heard	even	if	they	're	not	 s 	 een 	 	,	and	that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	they	bang	on	 space 	 - 	 time 	 	like	a	drum	.
 N 	 ow 	 	we	owe	the	idea	that	space	can	ring	like	a	drum	to	 Al 	 bert 	 	Einstein	--	to	whom	we	owe	so	much	.
Einstein	 real 	 ized 	 	that	if	space	 we 	 re 	 	empty	,	if	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 we 	 re 	 	empty	,	it	would	be	like	 th 	 is 	 	picture	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	for	 may 	 be 	 	 with 	 out 	 	the	 help 	 ful 	 	grid	drawn	on	it	.
But	if	we	 we 	 re 	 	 free 	 ly 	 	 fall 	 ing 	 	through	the	space	,	even	 with 	 out 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 help 	 ful 	 	grid	,	we	might	be	able	to	paint	it	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	would	notice	that	we	 travel 	 ed 	 	 a 	 long 	 	straight	lines	,	 un 	 deflect 	 ed 	 	straight	 path 	 s 	 	through	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
Einstein	 al 	 so 	 	 real 	 ized 	 	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	real	meat	of	the	matter	--	that	if	you	put	energy	or	mass	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	it	would	 curv 	 e 	 	space	,	and	a	 free 	 ly 	 	 fall 	 ing 	 	object	would	pass	by	,	let	's	say	,	the	Sun	and	it	would	be	 deflect 	 ed 	 	 a 	 long 	 	the	natural	 curv 	 es 	 	in	the	space	.
It	was	Einstein	's	great	general	 theor 	 y 	 	of	 relat 	 ivity 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	even	light	will	be	bent	by	 t 	 hose 	 	 path 	 s 	 	.
And	you	can	be	bent	so	much	that	you	're	caught	in	orbit	around	the	Sun	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	Earth	is	,	or	the	 Mo 	 on 	 	around	the	Earth	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	the	natural	 curv 	 es 	 	in	space	.
What	Einstein	did	not	 real 	 ize 	 	was	that	,	if	you	took	our	Sun	and	you	 crush 	 ed 	 	it	down	to	six	 kilometer 	 s 	 	--	so	you	took	a	million	 time 	 s 	 	the	mass	of	the	Earth	and	you	 crush 	 ed 	 	it	to	six	 kilometer 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	,	you	would	make	a	black	hole	,	an	object	so	dense	that	if	light	 veer 	 ed 	 	too	close	,	it	would	never	 es 	 cape 	 	--	a	dark	shadow	against	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
It	was	n't	Einstein	who	 real 	 ized 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	it	was	Karl	 Sch 	 war 	 z 	 s 	 child 	 	who	was	a	German	Jew	in	World	War	I	--	 join 	 ed 	 	the	German	 arm 	 y 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	an	 accomplish 	 ed 	 	scientist	,	 work 	 ing 	 	on	the	 Russia 	 n 	 	front	.
I	like	to	imagine	 Sch 	 war 	 z 	 s 	 child 	 	in	the	war	in	the	 trench 	 es 	 	 calcul 	 ating 	 	 ball 	 istic 	 	 tra 	 ject 	 ories 	 	for	 can 	 non 	 	fire	,	and	then	,	in	between	,	 calcul 	 ating 	 	Einstein	's	 equ 	 ations 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	you	do	in	the	 trench 	 es 	 	.
And	he	was	 read 	 ing 	 	Einstein	's	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 publish 	 ed 	 	general	 theor 	 y 	 	of	 relat 	 ivity 	 	,	and	he	was	 thrill 	 ed 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	.
And	he	 quick 	 ly 	 	 sur 	 mis 	 ed 	 	an	exact	 mathematic 	 al 	 	solution	that	 de 	 scribed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	:	 curv 	 es 	 	so	strong	that	space	would	rain	down	 in 	 to 	 	them	,	space	 it 	 self 	 	would	 curv 	 e 	 	like	a	 water 	 fall 	 	 flow 	 ing 	 	down	the	throat	of	a	hole	.
And	even	light	could	not	 es 	 cape 	 	 th 	 is 	 	current	.
Light	would	be	 drag 	 ged 	 	down	the	hole	 a 	 s 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	else	would	be	,	and	all	that	would	be	left	would	be	a	shadow	.
 N 	 ow 	 	he	wrote	to	Einstein	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 A 	 s 	 	you	will	see	,	the	war	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	kind	to	me	 en 	 ough 	 	.
 De 	 spite 	 	the	heavy	 gun 	 fire 	 	,	I	've	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	get	away	from	it	all	and	walk	through	the	land	of	your	 idea 	 s 	 	.	''
And	Einstein	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 impress 	 ed 	 	with	his	exact	solution	,	and	I	should	hope	 al 	 so 	 	the	 d 	 ed 	 ic 	 ation 	 	of	the	scientist	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	 hard 	 work 	 ing 	 	scientist	under	harsh	 condition 	 s 	 	.
And	he	took	 Sch 	 war 	 z 	 s 	 child 	 	's	idea	to	the	 Prussia 	 n 	 	Academy	of	 Science 	 s 	 	the	next	week	.
But	Einstein	 al 	 ways 	 	thought	black	 hole 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	a	 mathematic 	 al 	 	 odd 	 ity 	 	.
He	did	not	 believ 	 e 	 	they	 exist 	 ed 	 	in	nature	.
He	thought	nature	would	protect	us	from	 the 	 ir 	 	 form 	 ation 	 	.
It	was	 decade 	 s 	 	before	the	term	``	black	hole	''	was	 co 	 in 	 ed 	 	and	people	 real 	 ized 	 	that	black	 hole 	 s 	 	are	real	 astro 	 physical 	 	 object 	 s 	 	--	in	fact	they	're	the	death	state	of	 ver 	 y 	 	massive	 star 	 s 	 	that	collapse	 catastroph 	 ically 	 	at	the	end	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 life 	 time 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	our	Sun	will	not	collapse	to	a	black	hole	.
It	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	not	massive	 en 	 ough 	 	.
But	if	we	did	a	little	thought	experiment	--	 a 	 s 	 	Einstein	was	 ver 	 y 	 	fond	of	 do 	 ing 	 	--	we	could	imagine	 put 	 ting 	 	the	Sun	 crush 	 ed 	 	down	to	six	 kilometer 	 s 	 	,	and	 put 	 ting 	 	a	 tin 	 y 	 	little	Earth	around	it	in	orbit	,	 may 	 be 	 	30	 kilometer 	 s 	 	 out 	 side 	 	of	the	 black 	 - 	 hole 	 	 s 	 un 	 	.
And	it	would	be	 self 	 - 	 illuminate 	 d 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	now	the	Sun	's	gone	,	we	have	no	other	source	of	light	--	so	let	's	make	our	little	Earth	 self 	 - 	 illuminate 	 d 	 	.
And	you	would	 real 	 ize 	 	you	could	put	the	Earth	in	a	happy	orbit	even	30	km	 out 	 side 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 crush 	 ed 	 	black	hole	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 crush 	 ed 	 	black	hole	 actual 	 ly 	 	would	fit	 in 	 side 	 	 Man 	 hat 	 tan 	 	,	more	or	less	.
It	might	 s 	 pill 	 	off	 in 	 to 	 	the	 Hu 	 d 	 son 	 	a	little	bit	before	it	 destroy 	 ed 	 	the	Earth	.
But	 bas 	 ically 	 	that	's	what	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	.
We	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	an	object	that	you	could	crush	down	to	half	the	square	area	of	 Man 	 hat 	 tan 	 	.
So	we	move	 th 	 is 	 	Earth	 ver 	 y 	 	close	--	30	 kilometer 	 s 	 	 out 	 side 	 	--	and	we	notice	it	's	 perfect 	 ly 	 	fine	 orbit 	 ing 	 	around	the	black	hole	.
There	's	a	sort	of	myth	that	black	 hole 	 s 	 	devour	 every 	 thing 	 	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	but	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	to	get	 ver 	 y 	 	close	to	fall	in	.
But	what	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 impress 	 ive 	 	is	that	,	from	our	 van 	 t 	 age 	 	point	,	we	can	 al 	 ways 	 	see	the	Earth	.
It	can	not	hide	 be 	 hind 	 	the	black	hole	.
The	light	from	the	Earth	,	some	of	it	 fall 	 s 	 	in	,	but	some	of	it	 get 	 s 	 	 lens 	 ed 	 	around	and	 br 	 ought 	 	back	to	us	.
So	you	ca	n't	hide	 any 	 thing 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	a	black	hole	.
If	 th 	 is 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 Battle 	 star 	 	 Galactic 	 a 	 	and	you	're	 fight 	 ing 	 	the	 Cy 	 lon 	 s 	 	,	do	n't	hide	 be 	 hind 	 	the	black	hole	.
 The 	 y 	 	can	see	you	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	our	Sun	will	not	collapse	to	a	black	hole	--	it	's	not	massive	 en 	 ough 	 	--	but	there	are	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	black	 hole 	 s 	 	in	our	 galax 	 y 	 	.
And	if	one	 we 	 re 	 	to	eclipse	the	 Mil 	 ky 	 	Way	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	would	look	like	.
We	would	see	a	shadow	of	that	black	hole	against	the	hundred	billion	 star 	 s 	 	in	the	 Mil 	 ky 	 	Way	 Galax 	 y 	 	and	 it 	 s 	 	 lumin 	 ous 	 	dust	 lane 	 s 	 	.
And	if	we	 we 	 re 	 	to	fall	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	black	hole	,	we	would	see	all	of	that	light	 lens 	 ed 	 	around	it	,	and	we	could	even	start	to	cross	 in 	 to 	 	that	shadow	and	 re 	 ally 	 	not	notice	that	 any 	 thing 	 	 dramat 	 ic 	 	had	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
It	would	be	bad	if	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	fire	our	 rocket 	 s 	 	and	get	out	of	there	 be 	 cause 	 	we	could	n't	,	 any 	 more 	 	than	light	can	 es 	 cape 	 	.
But	even	 th 	 ough 	 	the	black	hole	is	dark	from	the	 out 	 side 	 	,	it	's	not	dark	on	the	 in 	 side 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	all	of	the	light	from	the	 galax 	 y 	 	can	fall	in	 be 	 hind 	 	us	.
And	even	 th 	 ough 	 	,	due	to	a	 relat 	 iv 	 istic 	 	effect	known	 a 	 s 	 	time	 dil 	 ation 	 	,	our	 clock 	 s 	 	would	seem	to	 s 	 low 	 	down	 relat 	 ive 	 	to	galactic	time	,	it	would	look	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	the	evolution	of	the	 galax 	 y 	 	had	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 ped 	 	up	and	shot	at	us	,	right	before	we	 we 	 re 	 	 crush 	 ed 	 	to	death	by	the	black	hole	.
It	would	be	like	a	 near 	 - 	 death 	 	experience	where	you	see	the	light	at	the	end	of	the	tunnel	,	but	it	's	a	total	death	experience	.
And	there	's	no	way	of	 tell 	 ing 	 	 any 	 body 	 	about	the	light	at	the	end	of	the	tunnel	.
 N 	 ow 	 	we	've	never	 s 	 een 	 	a	shadow	like	 th 	 is 	 	of	a	black	hole	,	but	black	 hole 	 s 	 	can	be	heard	,	even	if	they	're	not	 s 	 een 	 	.
 Imagin 	 e 	 	now	taking	an	 astro 	 physical 	 ly 	 	realistic	 situ 	 ation 	 	--	imagine	two	black	 hole 	 s 	 	that	have	lived	a	long	life	together	.
 May 	 be 	 	they	 start 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 star 	 s 	 	and	 collapse 	 d 	 	to	two	black	 hole 	 s 	 	--	each	one	10	 time 	 s 	 	the	mass	of	the	Sun	.
So	now	we	're	going	to	crush	them	down	to	60	 kilometer 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	can	be	 s 	 pinning 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 time 	 s 	 	a	second	.
At	the	end	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	,	they	're	going	around	each	other	 ver 	 y 	 	near	the	speed	of	light	.
So	they	're	 cross 	 ing 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 kilometer 	 s 	 	in	a	fraction	of	a	second	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	they	do	so	,	they	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 curv 	 e 	 	space	,	but	they	 leav 	 e 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	wake	a	 ring 	 ing 	 	of	space	,	an	actual	wave	on	 space 	 - 	 time 	 	.
Space	 squeez 	 es 	 	and	 stretch 	 es 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	 emanate 	 s 	 	out	from	these	black	 hole 	 s 	 	 bang 	 ing 	 	on	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
And	they	travel	out	 in 	 to 	 	the	 cosmo 	 s 	 	at	the	speed	of	light	.
 Th 	 is 	 	computer	 simul 	 ation 	 	is	due	to	a	 relat 	 ivity 	 	group	at	 NAS 	 A 	 	 God 	 d 	 ard 	 	.
It	took	 al 	 most 	 	30	 year 	 s 	 	for	 any 	 one 	 	in	the	world	to	crack	 th 	 is 	 	problem	.
 Th 	 is 	 	was	one	of	the	 group 	 s 	 	.
It	 show 	 s 	 	two	black	 hole 	 s 	 	in	orbit	around	each	other	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	with	these	 help 	 fully 	 	 paint 	 ed 	 	 curv 	 es 	 	.
And	if	you	can	see	--	it	's	kind	of	faint	--	but	if	you	can	see	the	red	 wave 	 s 	 	 e 	 man 	 ating 	 	out	,	 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	 gravit 	 ation 	 al 	 	 wave 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	 liter 	 ally 	 	the	 sound 	 s 	 	of	space	 ring 	 ing 	 	,	and	they	will	travel	out	from	these	black	 hole 	 s 	 	at	the	speed	of	light	 a 	 s 	 	they	ring	down	and	coalesce	to	one	 s 	 pinning 	 	,	quiet	black	hole	at	the	end	of	the	day	.
If	you	 we 	 re 	 	 stand 	 ing 	 	near	 en 	 ough 	 	,	your	ear	would	 reson 	 ate 	 	with	the	 squeez 	 ing 	 	and	 stretch 	 ing 	 	of	space	.
You	would	 liter 	 ally 	 	hear	the	sound	.
 N 	 ow 	 	of	course	,	your	head	would	be	 squeez 	 ed 	 	and	 stretch 	 ed 	 	 un 	 help 	 fully 	 	,	so	you	might	have	trouble	 understand 	 ing 	 	what	's	going	on	.
But	I	'd	like	to	play	for	you	the	sound	that	we	predict	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	from	my	group	--	a	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	less	 glamor 	 ous 	 	computer	 model 	 ing 	 	.
 Imagin 	 e 	 	a	 light 	 er 	 	black	hole	 fall 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	heavy	black	hole	.
The	sound	you	're	 hear 	 ing 	 	is	the	light	black	hole	 bang 	 ing 	 	on	space	each	time	it	 get 	 s 	 	close	.
If	it	 get 	 s 	 	far	away	,	it	's	a	little	too	quiet	.
But	it	 come 	 s 	 	in	like	a	 malle 	 t 	 	,	and	it	 liter 	 ally 	 	 crack 	 s 	 	space	,	 wo 	 b 	 bling 	 	it	like	a	drum	.
And	we	can	predict	what	the	sound	will	be	.
We	know	that	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 fall 	 s 	 	in	,	it	 get 	 s 	 	 fast 	 er 	 	and	it	 get 	 s 	 	 loud 	 er 	 	.
And	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	we	're	going	to	hear	the	little	guy	just	fall	 in 	 to 	 	the	 big 	 ger 	 	guy	.
 Th 	 en 	 	it	's	gone	.
 N 	 ow 	 	I	've	never	heard	it	that	loud	--	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	more	 dramat 	 ic 	 	.
At	home	it	 sound 	 s 	 	kind	of	 antic 	 lim 	 act 	 ic 	 	.
It	's	sort	of	like	 d 	 ing 	 	,	 d 	 ing 	 	,	 d 	 ing 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	sound	from	my	group	.
No	,	I	'm	not	 show 	 ing 	 	you	any	 image 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	black	 hole 	 s 	 	do	n't	 leav 	 e 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	 help 	 ful 	 	 trail 	 s 	 	of	ink	,	and	space	is	not	 paint 	 ed 	 	,	 show 	 ing 	 	you	the	 curv 	 es 	 	.
But	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	to	float	by	in	space	on	a	space	 holi 	 day 	 	and	you	heard	 th 	 is 	 	,	you	want	to	get	moving	.
 W 	 ant 	 	to	get	away	from	the	sound	.
 Bo 	 th 	 	black	 hole 	 s 	 	are	moving	.
 Bo 	 th 	 	black	 hole 	 s 	 	are	 get 	 ting 	 	 close 	 r 	 	together	.
In	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	they	're	both	 wo 	 b 	 bling 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	a	lot	.
And	then	they	're	going	to	merge	.
 N 	 ow 	 	it	's	gone	.
 N 	 ow 	 	that	chirp	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 character 	 istic 	 	of	black	 hole 	 s 	 	 mer 	 ging 	 	--	that	it	 chirp 	 s 	 	up	at	the	end	.
 N 	 ow 	 	that	's	our	 predict 	 ion 	 	for	what	we	'll	see	.
 Luc 	 ki 	 ly 	 	we	're	at	 th 	 is 	 	safe	distance	in	Long	 Be 	 ach 	 	,	California	.
And	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	,	 some 	 where 	 	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	two	black	 hole 	 s 	 	have	 merge 	 d 	 	.
And	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	,	the	space	around	us	after	 travel 	 ing 	 	 may 	 be 	 	a	million	light	 year 	 s 	 	,	or	a	million	 year 	 s 	 	,	at	the	speed	of	light	to	get	to	us	.
But	the	sound	is	too	quiet	for	any	of	us	to	ever	hear	.
There	are	 ver 	 y 	 	industrious	 experiment 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	built	on	Earth	--	one	 call 	 ed 	 	 LI 	 G 	 O 	 	--	which	will	detect	 dev 	 iation 	 s 	 	in	the	 squeez 	 ing 	 	and	 stretch 	 ing 	 	of	space	at	less	than	the	fraction	of	a	nucleus	of	an	atom	over	four	 kilometer 	 s 	 	.
It	's	a	 remark 	 ably 	 	 ambit 	 ious 	 	experiment	,	and	it	's	going	to	be	at	 advance 	 d 	 	 sensitiv 	 ity 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	next	few	 year 	 s 	 	--	to	pick	 th 	 is 	 	up	.
There	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	mission	 pro 	 posed 	 	for	space	,	which	 hope 	 fully 	 	will	launch	in	the	next	ten	 year 	 s 	 	,	 call 	 ed 	 	 LI 	 SA 	 	.
And	 LI 	 SA 	 	will	be	able	to	see	 super 	 - 	 massive 	 	black	 hole 	 s 	 	--	black	 hole 	 s 	 	 million 	 s 	 	or	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 time 	 s 	 	the	mass	of	the	Sun	.
In	 th 	 is 	 	 Hu 	 bble 	 	image	,	we	see	two	 galax 	 ies 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	look	like	they	're	 froze 	 n 	 	in	some	embrace	.
And	each	one	 prob 	 ably 	 	 harbor 	 s 	 	a	 super 	 - 	 massive 	 	black	hole	at	 it 	 s 	 	core	.
But	they	're	not	 froze 	 n 	 	;	they	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 mer 	 ging 	 	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	two	black	 hole 	 s 	 	are	 coll 	 id 	 ing 	 	,	and	they	will	merge	over	a	 billion 	 - 	 year 	 	time	scale	.
It	's	beyond	our	human	 per 	 ception 	 	to	pick	up	a	song	of	that	 dur 	 ation 	 	.
But	 LI 	 SA 	 	could	see	the	final	 stage 	 s 	 	of	two	 super 	 - 	 massive 	 	black	 hole 	 s 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	's	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	the	last	15	 minute 	 s 	 	before	they	fall	together	.
And	it	's	not	just	black	 hole 	 s 	 	,	but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	any	big	 disturb 	 ance 	 	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	--	and	the	 big 	 gest 	 	of	them	all	is	the	Big	Bang	.
When	that	 express 	 ion 	 	was	 co 	 in 	 ed 	 	,	it	was	 deris 	 ive 	 	--	like	,	``	Oh	,	who	would	 believ 	 e 	 	in	a	Big	Bang	?	''
But	now	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	might	be	more	 technical 	 ly 	 	accurate	 be 	 cause 	 	it	might	bang	.
It	might	make	a	sound	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 anim 	 ation 	 	from	my	 friend 	 s 	 	at	 Pro 	 ton 	 	 Studio 	 s 	 	 show 	 s 	 	looking	at	the	Big	Bang	from	the	 out 	 side 	 	.
We	do	n't	ever	want	to	do	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	.	We	want	to	be	 in 	 side 	 	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	no	 s 	 uch 	 	thing	 a 	 s 	 	 stand 	 ing 	 	 out 	 side 	 	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
So	imagine	you	're	 in 	 side 	 	the	Big	Bang	.
It	's	 every 	 where 	 	,	it	's	all	around	you	,	and	the	space	is	 wo 	 b 	 bling 	 	 chaotic 	 ally 	 	.
 Four 	 teen 	 	billion	 year 	 s 	 	pass	and	 th 	 is 	 	song	is	still	 ring 	 ing 	 	all	around	us	.
 Galax 	 ies 	 	form	,	and	 generation 	 s 	 	of	 star 	 s 	 	form	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 galax 	 ies 	 	,	and	around	one	star	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	one	star	,	is	a	 habit 	 able 	 	planet	.
And	here	we	are	 fr 	 ant 	 ically 	 	building	these	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	 do 	 ing 	 	these	 calcul 	 ations 	 	,	writing	these	computer	 code 	 s 	 	.
 Imagin 	 e 	 	a	billion	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	two	black	 hole 	 s 	 	 collide 	 d 	 	.
That	song	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 ring 	 ing 	 	through	space	for	all	that	time	.
We	 we 	 re 	 	n't	even	here	.
It	 get 	 s 	 	 close 	 r 	 	and	 close 	 r 	 	--	40,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	we	're	still	 do 	 ing 	 	cave	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
It	's	like	 hur 	 ry 	 	,	build	your	 instrument 	 s 	 	.
It	's	 get 	 ting 	 	 close 	 r 	 	and	 close 	 r 	 	,	and	in	20	...
 what 	 ever 	 	year	it	will	be	when	our	 detect 	 ors 	 	are	 final 	 ly 	 	at	 advance 	 d 	 	 sensitiv 	 ity 	 	--	we	'll	build	them	,	we	'll	turn	on	the	 machine 	 s 	 	and	,	bang	,	we	'll	catch	it	--	the	first	song	from	space	.
If	it	was	the	Big	Bang	we	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	pick	up	,	it	would	sound	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
It	's	a	 terr 	 ible 	 	sound	.
It	's	 liter 	 ally 	 	the	definition	of	noise	.
It	's	white	noise	;	it	's	 s 	 uch 	 	a	chaotic	 ring 	 ing 	 	.
But	it	's	around	us	 every 	 where 	 	,	 pre 	 sum 	 ably 	 	,	if	it	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 be 	 en 	 	 wipe 	 d 	 	out	by	some	other	process	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
And	if	we	pick	it	up	,	it	will	be	music	to	our	 ear 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	will	be	the	quiet	echo	of	that	moment	of	our	creation	,	of	our	 observ 	 able 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
So	 with 	 in 	 	the	next	few	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	'll	be	able	to	turn	up	the	 sound 	 track 	 	a	little	bit	,	render	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	in	audio	.
But	if	we	detect	 t 	 hose 	 	 ear 	 liest 	 	 moment 	 s 	 	,	it	'll	 br 	 ing 	 	us	that	much	 close 	 r 	 	to	an	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	the	Big	Bang	,	which	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	us	that	much	 close 	 r 	 	to	 ask 	 ing 	 	some	of	the	 hard 	 est 	 	,	most	elusive	,	 question 	 s 	 	.
If	we	run	the	movie	of	our	 uni 	 verse 	 	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	,	we	know	that	there	was	a	Big	Bang	in	our	past	,	and	we	might	even	hear	the	 caco 	 phon 	 ous 	 	sound	of	it	,	but	was	our	Big	Bang	the	 on 	 ly 	 	Big	Bang	?
I	mean	we	have	to	ask	,	 ha 	 s 	 	it	 happen 	 ed 	 	before	?
Will	it	happen	 aga 	 in 	 	?
I	mean	,	in	the	spirit	of	 ris 	 ing 	 	to	TED	's	 challeng 	 e 	 	to	 re 	 ignite 	 	wonder	,	we	can	ask	 question 	 s 	 	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	last	minute	,	that	 honest 	 ly 	 	might	 evad 	 e 	 	us	 fore 	 ver 	 	.
But	we	have	to	ask	:	 I 	 s 	 	it	possible	that	our	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	just	a	plume	off	of	some	 great 	 er 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	?
Or	,	is	it	possible	that	we	're	just	a	branch	off	of	a	 multi 	 verse 	 	--	each	branch	with	 it 	 s 	 	own	Big	Bang	in	 it 	 s 	 	past	--	 may 	 be 	 	some	of	them	with	black	 hole 	 s 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	 drum 	 s 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	some	 with 	 out 	 	--	 may 	 be 	 	some	with	 senti 	 ent 	 	life	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	some	 with 	 out 	 	--	not	in	our	past	,	not	in	our	future	,	but	 some 	 how 	 	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	us	?
So	we	have	to	wonder	,	if	there	is	a	 multi 	 verse 	 	,	in	some	other	patch	of	that	 multi 	 verse 	 	,	are	there	 creature 	 s 	 	?
 He 	 re 	 	's	my	 multi 	 verse 	 	 creature 	 s 	 	.
 A 	 re 	 	there	other	 creature 	 s 	 	in	the	 multi 	 verse 	 	,	 wonder 	 ing 	 	about	us	and	 wonder 	 ing 	 	about	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 origin 	 s 	 	?
And	if	they	are	,	I	can	imagine	them	 a 	 s 	 	we	are	,	 calcul 	 ating 	 	,	writing	computer	code	,	building	 instrument 	 s 	 	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	detect	that	 faint 	 est 	 	sound	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 origin 	 s 	 	and	 wonder 	 ing 	 	who	else	is	out	there	.
Thank	you	.	Thank	you	.
 Tree 	 s 	 	epitomize	 s 	 ta 	 sis 	 	.
 Tree 	 s 	 	are	 root 	 ed 	 	in	the	ground	in	one	place	for	 man 	 y 	 	human	 generation 	 s 	 	,	but	if	we	shift	our	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	from	the	trunk	to	the	 t 	 wig 	 s 	 	,	 tree 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	dynamic	 ent 	 ities 	 	,	moving	and	growing	.
And	I	 decide 	 d 	 	to	explore	 th 	 is 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	by	 turn 	 ing 	 	 tree 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 artist 	 s 	 	.
I	 simpl 	 y 	 	 ti 	 ed 	 	the	end	of	a	 paint 	 brush 	 	onto	a	 t 	 wig 	 	.
I	 wait 	 ed 	 	for	the	wind	to	come	up	and	held	up	a	canvas	,	and	that	 produce 	 d 	 	art	.
The	piece	of	art	you	see	on	your	left	is	 paint 	 ed 	 	by	a	western	red	cedar	and	that	on	your	right	by	a	Douglas	fir	,	and	what	I	 learn 	 ed 	 	was	that	different	species	have	different	 signature 	 s 	 	,	like	a	Picasso	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	a	 Mon 	 et 	 	.
But	I	was	 al 	 so 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	the	 move 	 ment 	 	of	 tree 	 s 	 	and	how	 th 	 is 	 	art	might	let	me	capture	that	and	 quant 	 ify 	 	it	,	so	to	measure	the	distance	that	a	single	vine	 ma 	 ple 	 	tree	--	which	 produce 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 	--	 move 	 d 	 	in	a	single	year	,	I	 simpl 	 y 	 	 measur 	 ed 	 	and	 summ 	 ed 	 	each	of	 t 	 hose 	 	lines	.
I	 multi 	 plied 	 	them	by	the	number	of	 t 	 wig 	 s 	 	per	branch	and	the	number	of	 branch 	 es 	 	per	tree	and	then	 divid 	 ed 	 	that	by	the	number	of	 minute 	 s 	 	per	year	.
And	so	I	was	able	to	 calcul 	 ate 	 	how	far	a	single	tree	 move 	 d 	 	in	a	single	year	.
You	might	have	a	guess	.
The	answer	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	186,540	 mile 	 s 	 	,	or	seven	 time 	 s 	 	around	the	 glob 	 e 	 	.
And	so	 simpl 	 y 	 	by	shifting	our	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	from	a	single	trunk	to	the	 man 	 y 	 	dynamic	 t 	 wig 	 s 	 	,	we	are	able	to	see	that	 tree 	 s 	 	are	not	 simpl 	 y 	 	static	 ent 	 ities 	 	,	but	 ra 	 ther 	 	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	dynamic	.
And	I	 beg 	 an 	 	to	think	about	ways	that	we	might	consider	 th 	 is 	 	 less 	 on 	 	of	 tree 	 s 	 	,	to	consider	other	 ent 	 ities 	 	that	are	 al 	 so 	 	static	and	 s 	 tuck 	 	,	but	which	cry	for	change	and	 dynamic 	 ism 	 	,	and	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 ent 	 ities 	 	is	our	 pri 	 son 	 s 	 	.
 Prison 	 s 	 	,	of	course	,	are	where	people	who	break	our	 law 	 s 	 	are	 s 	 tuck 	 	,	 con 	 fin 	 ed 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	 bar 	 s 	 	.
And	our	 pri 	 son 	 	system	 it 	 self 	 	is	 s 	 tuck 	 	.
The	 Unit 	 ed 	 	 Stat 	 es 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	over	2.3	million	 incarce 	 rated 	 	men	and	women	.
That	number	is	 ris 	 ing 	 	.
Of	the	100	 incarce 	 rated 	 	people	that	are	released	,	60	will	return	to	 pri 	 son 	 	.
 Fund 	 s 	 	for	education	,	for	training	and	for	 rehabilit 	 ation 	 	are	 dec 	 lining 	 	,	so	 th 	 is 	 	 despair 	 ing 	 	cycle	of	 incarce 	 ration 	 	 continu 	 es 	 	.
I	 decide 	 d 	 	to	ask	 whet 	 her 	 	the	 less 	 on 	 	I	had	 learn 	 ed 	 	from	 tree 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 artist 	 s 	 	could	be	 appli 	 ed 	 	to	a	static	institution	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	our	 pri 	 son 	 s 	 	,	and	I	think	the	answer	is	 y 	 es 	 	.
In	the	year	2007	,	I	 start 	 ed 	 	a	 partner 	 ship 	 	with	the	 Wash 	 ington 	 	 Stat 	 e 	 	Department	of	 Correct 	 ions 	 	.
 Work 	 ing 	 	with	four	 pri 	 son 	 s 	 	,	we	 beg 	 an 	 	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	science	and	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	 sustain 	 ability 	 	and	 conserv 	 ation 	 	 project 	 s 	 	to	four	state	 pri 	 son 	 s 	 	.
We	give	science	 lectur 	 es 	 	,	and	the	men	here	are	 choos 	 ing 	 	to	come	to	our	science	 lectur 	 es 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 watch 	 ing 	 	 tele 	 vision 	 	or	 weight 	 lift 	 ing 	 	.
That	,	I	think	,	is	 move 	 ment 	 	.
We	 partner 	 ed 	 	with	the	Nature	 Conserv 	 ancy 	 	for	 in 	 mate 	 s 	 	at	 St 	 afford 	 	 Cre 	 ek 	 	 Correct 	 ional 	 	 Cent 	 er 	 	to	grow	 en 	 danger 	 ed 	 	prairie	 plant 	 s 	 	for	 resto 	 ration 	 	of	 re 	 lic 	 	prairie	 area 	 s 	 	in	 Wash 	 ington 	 	state	.
That	,	I	think	,	is	 move 	 ment 	 	.
We	 work 	 ed 	 	with	the	 Wash 	 ington 	 	 Stat 	 e 	 	Department	of	Fish	and	 Wild 	 life 	 	to	grow	 en 	 danger 	 ed 	 	 frog 	 s 	 	--	the	Oregon	 spot 	 ted 	 	frog	--	for	 lat 	 er 	 	 re 	 lease 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 protect 	 ed 	 	 wet 	 land 	 s 	 	.
That	,	I	think	,	is	 move 	 ment 	 	.
And	just	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	we	've	 beg 	 un 	 	to	work	with	 t 	 hose 	 	men	who	are	 s 	 egreg 	 ated 	 	in	what	we	call	 Super 	 max 	 	 facil 	 ities 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	've	 incur 	 red 	 	violent	 in 	 fraction 	 s 	 	by	 be 	 coming 	 	violent	with	 guard 	 s 	 	and	with	other	 prisoner 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	 ke 	 pt 	 	in	bare	 cell 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	for	23	 hour 	 s 	 	a	day	.
When	they	have	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	review	 board 	 s 	 	or	mental	health	 professional 	 s 	 	,	they	're	 place 	 d 	 	in	 im 	 mobile 	 	 booth 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
For	one	hour	a	day	they	're	 br 	 ought 	 	to	these	 b 	 leak 	 	and	 b 	 land 	 	 exercis 	 e 	 	 yard 	 s 	 	.
 Al 	 th 	 ough 	 	we	ca	n't	 br 	 ing 	 	 tree 	 s 	 	and	prairie	 plant 	 s 	 	and	 frog 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	these	 environment 	 s 	 	,	we	are	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	 image 	 s 	 	of	nature	 in 	 to 	 	these	 exercis 	 e 	 	 yard 	 s 	 	,	 put 	 ting 	 	them	on	the	 wall 	 s 	 	,	so	at	 l 	 east 	 	they	get	contact	with	visual	 image 	 s 	 	of	nature	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 Mr 	 .

And	so	what	we	see	,	I	think	,	is	that	small	,	 collect 	 ive 	 	 move 	 ments 	 	of	change	can	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	move	an	 ent 	 ity 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	our	own	 pri 	 son 	 	system	in	a	direction	of	hope	.
We	know	that	 tree 	 s 	 	are	static	 ent 	 ities 	 	when	we	look	at	 the 	 ir 	 	 trunk 	 s 	 	.
But	if	 tree 	 s 	 	can	create	art	,	if	they	can	 en 	 circle 	 	the	 glob 	 e 	 	seven	 time 	 s 	 	in	one	year	,	if	 prisoner 	 s 	 	can	grow	 plant 	 s 	 	and	raise	 frog 	 s 	 	,	then	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	there	are	other	static	 ent 	 ities 	 	that	we	hold	 in 	 side 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	like	grief	,	like	 addict 	 ions 	 	,	like	 rac 	 ism 	 	,	that	can	 al 	 so 	 	change	.
Thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.

That	 im 	 plies 	 	the	 trust 	 ed 	 	person	wo	n't	 viol 	 ate 	 	the	trust	.
 A 	 s 	 	the	child	 grow 	 s 	 	,	it	 begin 	 s 	 	to	discover	that	the	person	 trust 	 ed 	 	is	 viol 	 ating 	 	the	trust	.
It	 do 	 es 	 	n't	know	even	the	word	``	 viol 	 ation 	 	.	''
 There 	 fore 	 	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	blame	 it 	 self 	 	,	a	 word 	 less 	 	blame	,	which	is	more	difficult	to	 re 	 ally 	 	 re 	 solve 	 	--	the	 word 	 less 	 	 self 	 - 	 blame 	 	.
 A 	 s 	 	the	child	 grow 	 s 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	an	adult	:	so	far	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	consumer	,	but	the	growth	of	a	human	 be 	 ing 	 	lies	in	his	or	her	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	 con 	 tribute 	 	,	to	be	a	contributor	.

To	be	 com 	 passionate 	 	is	not	a	joke	.
It	's	not	that	simple	.
One	 ha 	 s 	 	to	discover	a	certain	 big 	 ness 	 	in	 one 	 self 	 	.
That	 big 	 ness 	 	should	be	 center 	 ed 	 	on	 one 	 self 	 	,	not	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	money	,	not	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	power	you	wield	,	not	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	any	 stat 	 us 	 	that	you	can	command	in	the	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	but	it	should	be	 center 	 ed 	 	on	 one 	 self 	 	.
The	self	:	you	are	 self 	 - 	 aware 	 	.
On	that	self	,	it	should	be	 center 	 ed 	 	--	a	 big 	 ness 	 	,	a	 whole 	 ness 	 	.
 Other 	 wise 	 	,	 compass 	 ion 	 	is	just	a	word	and	a	dream	.
You	can	be	 com 	 passionate 	 	 occasion 	 ally 	 	,	more	 move 	 d 	 	by	 empath 	 y 	 	than	by	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
Thank	God	we	are	 em 	 pathetic 	 	.

No	culture	,	no	nation	and	 national 	 ism 	 	--	 noth 	 ing 	 	can	touch	it	 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	 empath 	 y 	 	.
And	that	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	 empath 	 ize 	 	is	the	window	through	which	you	reach	out	to	people	,	you	do	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 make 	 s 	 	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	in	 some 	 body 	 	's	life	--	even	 word 	 s 	 	,	even	time	.
 Com 	 pass 	 ion 	 	is	not	defined	in	one	form	.
There	's	no	Indian	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
There	's	no	American	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
It	 transcend 	 s 	 	nation	,	the	gender	,	the	age	.
Why	?	 Be 	 cause 	 	it	is	there	in	 every 	 body 	 	.
It	's	 experience 	 d 	 	by	people	 occasion 	 ally 	 	.
 Th 	 en 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 occasion 	 al 	 	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	we	are	not	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	--	it	will	never	remain	 occasion 	 al 	 	.
By	 man 	 date 	 	,	you	can	not	make	a	person	 com 	 passionate 	 	.
You	ca	n't	say	,	``	 P 	 lease 	 	love	me	.	''
Love	is	 some 	 thing 	 	you	discover	.
It	's	not	an	action	,	but	in	the	English	language	,	it	is	 al 	 so 	 	an	action	.
I	will	come	to	it	 lat 	 er 	 	.
So	one	 ha 	 s 	 	got	to	discover	a	certain	 whole 	 ness 	 	.
I	am	going	to	cite	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	whole	,	which	is	 with 	 in 	 	our	experience	,	 every 	 body 	 	's	experience	.
In	spite	of	a	 ver 	 y 	 	tragic	life	,	one	is	happy	in	 moment 	 s 	 	which	are	 ver 	 y 	 	few	and	far	between	.
And	the	one	who	is	happy	,	even	for	a	 s 	 lap 	 stick 	 	joke	,	 accept 	 s 	 	 him 	 self 	 	and	 al 	 so 	 	the	scheme	of	 thing 	 s 	 	in	which	one	 find 	 s 	 	 one 	 self 	 	.
That	 mean 	 s 	 	the	whole	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	known	 thing 	 s 	 	and	 un 	 known 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
All	of	them	are	 total 	 ly 	 	 accept 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	you	discover	your	 whole 	 ness 	 	in	 your 	 self 	 	.
The	subject	--	``	me	''	--	and	the	object	--	the	scheme	of	 thing 	 s 	 	--	fuse	 in 	 to 	 	 one 	 ness 	 	,	an	experience	 no 	 body 	 	can	say	,	``	I	am	 deni 	 ed 	 	of	,	''	an	experience	common	to	all	and	 s 	 un 	 dry 	 	.
That	experience	 confirm 	 s 	 	that	,	in	spite	of	all	your	 limit 	 ations 	 	--	all	your	 want 	 s 	 	,	 desir 	 es 	 	,	 un 	 fulfill 	 ed 	 	,	and	the	credit	 card 	 s 	 	and	 lay 	 off 	 s 	 	and	,	 final 	 ly 	 	,	 bald 	 ness 	 	--	you	can	be	happy	.
But	the	 extens 	 ion 	 	of	the	logic	is	that	you	do	n't	need	to	fulfill	your	 desir 	 e 	 	to	be	happy	.
You	are	the	 ver 	 y 	 	happiness	,	the	 whole 	 ness 	 	that	you	want	to	be	.
There	's	no	choice	in	 th 	 is 	 	:	that	 on 	 ly 	 	 confirm 	 s 	 	the	 re 	 ality 	 	that	the	 whole 	 ness 	 	can	not	be	different	from	you	,	can	not	be	minus	you	.
It	 ha 	 s 	 	got	to	be	you	.
You	can	not	be	a	part	of	 whole 	 ness 	 	and	still	be	whole	.
Your	moment	of	happiness	 reveal 	 s 	 	that	 re 	 ality 	 	,	that	 real 	 ization 	 	,	that	 re 	 cognition 	 	:	``	 May 	 be 	 	I	am	the	whole	.
 May 	 be 	 	the	swami	is	right	.
 May 	 be 	 	the	swami	is	right	.	''	You	start	your	new	life	.
 Th 	 en 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 meaning 	 ful 	 	.
I	have	no	more	reason	to	blame	 my 	 self 	 	.
If	one	 ha 	 s 	 	to	blame	 one 	 self 	 	,	one	 ha 	 s 	 	a	million	 reason 	 s 	 	plus	 man 	 y 	 	.
But	if	I	say	,	in	spite	of	my	body	 be 	 ing 	 	 limit 	 ed 	 	--	if	it	is	black	it	is	not	white	,	if	it	is	white	it	is	not	black	:	body	is	 limit 	 ed 	 	any	which	way	you	look	at	it	.	 L 	 imit 	 ed 	 	.
Your	knowledge	is	 limit 	 ed 	 	,	health	is	 limit 	 ed 	 	,	and	power	is	 there 	 fore 	 	 limit 	 ed 	 	,	and	the	 cheer 	 fulness 	 	is	going	to	be	 limit 	 ed 	 	.
 Com 	 pass 	 ion 	 	is	going	to	be	 limit 	 ed 	 	.
 Every 	 thing 	 	is	going	to	be	 limit 	 less 	 	.
You	can	not	command	 compass 	 ion 	 	 un 	 less 	 	you	 be 	 come 	 	 limit 	 less 	 	,	and	 no 	 body 	 	can	 be 	 come 	 	 limit 	 less 	 	,	either	you	are	or	you	are	not	.	Period	.
And	there	is	no	way	of	your	 be 	 ing 	 	not	 limit 	 less 	 	too	.
Your	own	experience	 reveal 	 s 	 	,	in	spite	of	all	 limit 	 ations 	 	,	you	are	the	whole	.
And	the	 whole 	 ness 	 	is	the	 re 	 ality 	 	of	you	when	you	 re 	 late 	 	to	the	world	.
It	is	love	first	.
When	you	 re 	 late 	 	to	the	world	,	the	dynamic	 manifest 	 ation 	 	of	the	 whole 	 ness 	 	is	,	what	we	say	,	love	.
And	 it 	 self 	 	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 compass 	 ion 	 	if	the	object	that	you	 re 	 late 	 	to	 evoke 	 s 	 	that	emotion	.
 Th 	 en 	 	that	 aga 	 in 	 	 transform 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	giving	,	 in 	 to 	 	sharing	.
You	express	 your 	 self 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	you	have	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
To	discover	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	you	need	to	be	 com 	 passionate 	 	.
To	discover	the	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	give	and	share	,	you	need	to	be	giving	and	sharing	.
There	is	no	 short 	 cut 	 	:	it	is	like	 swimm 	 ing 	 	by	 swimm 	 ing 	 	.
You	learn	 swimm 	 ing 	 	by	 swimm 	 ing 	 	.
You	can	not	learn	 swimm 	 ing 	 	on	a	foam	mattress	and	enter	 in 	 to 	 	water	.
You	learn	 swimm 	 ing 	 	by	 swimm 	 ing 	 	.	You	learn	 cycl 	 ing 	 	by	 cycl 	 ing 	 	.
You	learn	 cook 	 ing 	 	by	 cook 	 ing 	 	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	some	 sym 	 pathetic 	 	people	around	you	to	eat	what	you	cook	.
And	,	 there 	 fore 	 	,	what	I	say	,	you	have	to	fake	it	and	make	it	.
You	need	to	.
My	 pre 	 decessor 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	that	.
You	have	to	act	it	out	.
You	have	to	act	 com 	 passionate 	 ly 	 	.
There	is	no	verb	for	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	but	you	have	an	 ad 	 verb 	 	for	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
That	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	to	me	.
You	act	 com 	 passionate 	 ly 	 	.
But	then	,	how	to	act	 com 	 passionate 	 ly 	 	if	you	do	n't	have	 compass 	 ion 	 	?
That	is	where	you	fake	.
You	fake	it	and	make	it	.	 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	 man 	 tra 	 	of	the	 Unit 	 ed 	 	 Stat 	 es 	 	of	America	.
You	fake	it	and	make	it	.
You	act	 com 	 passionate 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	you	have	 compass 	 ion 	 	:	grind	your	 tee 	 th 	 	,	take	all	the	support	system	.
If	you	know	how	to	pray	,	pray	.
Ask	for	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
Let	me	act	 com 	 passionate 	 ly 	 	.
Do	it	.
You	'll	discover	 compass 	 ion 	 	and	 al 	 so 	 	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	a	 relat 	 ive 	 	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	and	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	if	you	get	the	right	 teach 	 ing 	 	,	you	'll	discover	 compass 	 ion 	 	is	a	dynamic	 manifest 	 ation 	 	of	the	 re 	 ality 	 	of	 your 	 self 	 	,	which	is	 one 	 ness 	 	,	 whole 	 ness 	 	,	and	that	's	what	you	are	.
With	these	 word 	 s 	 	,	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
The	story	I	 want 	 ed 	 	to	share	with	you	 to 	 day 	 	is	my	 challeng 	 e 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	Iranian	artist	,	 a 	 s 	 	an	Iranian	woman	artist	,	 a 	 s 	 	an	Iranian	woman	artist	living	in	 ex 	 ile 	 	.
Well	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 plus 	 es 	 	and	 minus 	 es 	 	.
On	the	dark	side	,	 politic 	 s 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	seem	to	 es 	 cape 	 	people	like	me	.
Every	Iranian	artist	,	in	one	form	or	 an 	 other 	 	,	is	 politic 	 al 	 	.
 Poli 	 tics 	 	have	defined	our	 live 	 s 	 	.
If	you	're	living	in	Iran	,	you	're	facing	 censor 	 ship 	 	,	 harass 	 ment 	 	,	arrest	,	torture	--	at	 time 	 s 	 	,	 exec 	 ution 	 	.
If	you	're	living	 out 	 side 	 	like	me	,	you	're	 face 	 d 	 	with	life	in	 ex 	 ile 	 	--	the	pain	of	the	 long 	 ing 	 	and	the	 separat 	 ion 	 	from	your	 love 	 d 	 	 one 	 s 	 	and	your	family	.
 There 	 fore 	 	,	we	do	n't	find	the	moral	,	 emotion 	 al 	 	,	 psycho 	 logical 	 	and	 politic 	 al 	 	space	to	distance	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	from	the	 re 	 ality 	 	of	social	 respons 	 ibility 	 	.
 Odd 	 ly 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	an	artist	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 my 	 self 	 	 find 	 s 	 	 her 	 self 	 	 al 	 so 	 	in	the	position	of	 be 	 ing 	 	the	voice	,	the	speaker	of	my	people	,	even	if	I	have	,	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	no	access	to	my	own	country	.
 Al 	 so 	 	,	people	like	 my 	 self 	 	,	we	're	 fight 	 ing 	 	two	 battle 	 s 	 	on	different	 ground 	 s 	 	.
We	're	 be 	 ing 	 	critical	of	the	West	,	the	 per 	 ception 	 	of	the	West	about	our	 ident 	 ity 	 	--	about	the	image	that	is	 construct 	 ed 	 	about	us	,	about	our	women	,	about	our	 politic 	 s 	 	,	about	our	 relig 	 ion 	 	.
We	are	there	to	take	 pri 	 de 	 	and	insist	on	respect	.
And	at	the	same	time	,	we	're	 fight 	 ing 	 	 an 	 other 	 	battle	.
That	is	our	regime	,	our	government	--	our	 atro 	 c 	 ious 	 	government	,	[	that	]	 ha 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	every	crime	in	order	to	stay	in	power	.
Our	 artist 	 s 	 	are	at	risk	.
We	are	in	a	position	of	danger	.
We	pose	a	threat	to	the	order	of	the	government	.
But	 iron 	 ically 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 empower 	 ed 	 	all	of	us	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	are	 consider 	 ed 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 artist 	 s 	 	,	central	to	the	cultural	,	 politic 	 al 	 	,	social	 dis 	 course 	 	in	Iran	.
We	are	there	to	inspire	,	to	 provok 	 e 	 	,	to	mobilize	,	to	 br 	 ing 	 	hope	to	our	people	.
We	are	the	 report 	 ers 	 	of	our	people	,	and	are	 communicator 	 s 	 	to	the	 out 	 side 	 	world	.
Art	is	our	weapon	.
 Cultur 	 e 	 	is	a	form	of	 resist 	 ance 	 	.
I	 en 	 vy 	 	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	the	 artist 	 s 	 	of	the	West	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 free 	 dom 	 	of	 express 	 ion 	 	.
For	the	fact	that	they	can	distance	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	from	the	question	of	 politic 	 s 	 	.
From	the	fact	that	they	are	 on 	 ly 	 	 serv 	 ing 	 	one	audience	,	 main 	 ly 	 	the	Western	culture	.
But	 al 	 so 	 	,	I	worry	about	the	West	,	 be 	 cause 	 	often	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	Western	world	that	we	have	,	culture	 risk 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	a	form	of	 entertain 	 ment 	 	.
Our	people	depend	on	our	 artist 	 s 	 	,	and	culture	is	beyond	communication	.
My	journey	 a 	 s 	 	an	artist	 start 	 ed 	 	from	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	personal	place	.
I	did	not	start	to	make	social	 comment 	 ary 	 	about	my	country	.
The	first	one	that	you	see	in	front	of	you	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	when	I	first	 return 	 ed 	 	to	Iran	after	 be 	 ing 	 	 separat 	 ed 	 	for	a	good	12	 year 	 s 	 	.
It	was	after	the	Islamic	 R 	 evolution 	 	of	1979	.
 Whi 	 le 	 	I	was	absent	from	Iran	,	the	Islamic	 R 	 evolution 	 	had	 descend 	 ed 	 	on	Iran	and	had	 entire 	 ly 	 	 transform 	 ed 	 	the	country	from	 Per 	 s 	 ian 	 	to	the	Islamic	culture	.
I	came	 main 	 ly 	 	to	be	 re 	 unit 	 ed 	 	with	my	family	and	to	 re 	 connect 	 	in	a	way	that	I	found	my	place	in	the	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
But	 in 	 stead 	 	,	I	found	a	country	that	was	 total 	 ly 	 	 ideo 	 logical 	 	and	that	I	did	n't	 recogn 	 ize 	 	 any 	 more 	 	.
 Mo 	 re 	 	so	,	I	 be 	 came 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	I	was	facing	my	own	personal	 dilemma 	 s 	 	and	 question 	 s 	 	,	I	 be 	 came 	 	 immers 	 ed 	 	in	the	 stud 	 y 	 	of	the	Islamic	 R 	 evolution 	 	--	how	,	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	it	had	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 transform 	 ed 	 	the	 live 	 s 	 	of	Iranian	women	.
I	found	the	subject	of	Iranian	women	 immense 	 ly 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	in	the	way	the	women	of	Iran	,	 historic 	 ally 	 	,	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	 em 	 body 	 	the	 politic 	 al 	 	 transform 	 ation 	 	.
So	in	a	way	,	by	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	a	woman	,	you	can	read	the	structure	and	the	 ideo 	 logy 	 	of	the	country	.
So	I	made	a	group	of	work	that	at	once	 face 	 d 	 	my	own	personal	 question 	 s 	 	in	life	,	and	yet	it	 br 	 ought 	 	my	work	 in 	 to 	 	a	 large 	 r 	 	 dis 	 course 	 	--	the	subject	of	 martyr 	 dom 	 	,	the	question	of	 t 	 hose 	 	who	 will 	 ing 	 ly 	 	stand	in	that	 intersect 	 ion 	 	of	love	of	God	,	faith	,	but	violence	and	crime	and	 cruel 	 ty 	 	.
For	me	,	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 came 	 	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
And	yet	,	I	had	an	 un 	 usual 	 	position	 to 	 ward 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
I	was	an	 out 	 sider 	 	who	had	come	back	to	Iran	to	find	my	place	,	but	I	was	not	in	a	position	to	be	critical	of	the	government	or	the	 ideo 	 logy 	 	of	the	Islamic	 R 	 evolution 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 change 	 d 	 	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	I	found	my	voice	and	I	 discover 	 ed 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	I	did	n't	know	I	would	discover	.
So	my	art	 be 	 came 	 	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	more	critical	.
My	knife	 be 	 came 	 	a	little	 sharp 	 er 	 	.
And	I	fell	 in 	 to 	 	a	life	in	 ex 	 ile 	 	.
I	am	a	 nomad 	 ic 	 	artist	.
I	work	in	 Moro 	 cco 	 	,	in	 Turk 	 ey 	 	,	in	Mexico	.
I	go	 every 	 where 	 	to	make	 believ 	 e 	 	it	's	Iran	.
 N 	 ow 	 	I	am	making	 film 	 s 	 	.
Last	year	,	I	 finish 	 ed 	 	a	film	 call 	 ed 	 	``	Women	 With 	 out 	 	Men	.	''
``	Women	 With 	 out 	 	Men	''	 return 	 s 	 	to	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	but	 an 	 other 	 	part	of	our	Iranian	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
It	 go 	 es 	 	to	1953	when	American	 CI 	 A 	 	 exercis 	 ed 	 	a	coup	and	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	a	 democrat 	 ically 	 	 elect 	 ed 	 	 lead 	 er 	 	,	 Dr 	 . 	 	Mossadegh	.
The	book	is	written	by	an	Iranian	woman	,	 Shah 	 rnush 	 	 Par 	 s 	 i 	 pur 	 	.
It	's	a	 magic 	 al 	 	 re 	 alist 	 	novel	.
 Th 	 is 	 	book	is	 bann 	 ed 	 	,	and	she	 s 	 pent 	 	five	 year 	 s 	 	in	 pri 	 son 	 	.
My	obsession	with	 th 	 is 	 	book	,	and	the	reason	I	made	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	film	,	is	 be 	 cause 	 	it	at	once	was	 address 	 ing 	 	the	question	of	 be 	 ing 	 	a	female	--	 tradition 	 ally 	 	,	 historic 	 ally 	 	in	Iran	--	and	the	question	of	four	women	who	are	all	looking	for	an	idea	of	change	,	 free 	 dom 	 	and	 demo 	 cracy 	 	--	while	the	country	of	Iran	,	 equal 	 ly 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	if	 an 	 other 	 	character	,	 al 	 so 	 	 struggle 	 d 	 	for	an	idea	of	 free 	 dom 	 	and	 demo 	 cracy 	 	and	 in 	 depend 	 ence 	 	from	the	foreign	 intervention 	 s 	 	.
I	made	 th 	 is 	 	film	 be 	 cause 	 	I	felt	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	for	it	to	speak	to	the	 Western 	 ers 	 	about	our	 histo 	 ry 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	country	.
That	all	of	you	seem	to	remember	Iran	after	the	Islamic	 R 	 evolution 	 	.
That	Iran	was	once	a	secular	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	and	we	had	 demo 	 cracy 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 demo 	 cracy 	 	was	 stole 	 n 	 	from	us	by	the	American	government	,	by	the	 Brit 	 ish 	 	government	.
 Th 	 is 	 	film	 al 	 so 	 	 speak 	 s 	 	to	the	Iranian	people	in	 ask 	 ing 	 	them	to	return	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	and	look	at	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	before	they	 we 	 re 	 	so	 Islamic 	 ized 	 	--	in	the	way	we	 look 	 ed 	 	,	in	the	way	we	 play 	 ed 	 	music	,	in	the	way	we	had	intellectual	life	.
And	most	of	all	,	in	the	way	that	we	 f 	 ought 	 	for	 demo 	 cracy 	 	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	some	of	the	 shot 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	from	my	film	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	some	of	the	 image 	 s 	 	of	the	coup	.
And	we	made	 th 	 is 	 	film	in	 Casa 	 blanca 	 	,	 re 	 creating 	 	all	the	 shot 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	film	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	find	a	balance	between	 tell 	 ing 	 	a	 politic 	 al 	 	story	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	a	 femin 	 ine 	 	story	.
 Be 	 ing 	 	a	visual	artist	,	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	I	am	 fore 	 most 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	to	make	art	--	to	make	art	that	 transcend 	 s 	 	 politic 	 s 	 	,	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	the	question	of	 femin 	 ism 	 	,	and	 be 	 come 	 	an	 import 	 ant 	 	,	 time 	 less 	 	,	universal	work	of	art	.
The	 challeng 	 e 	 	I	have	is	how	to	do	that	.
How	to	tell	a	 politic 	 al 	 	story	but	an	 alle 	 gor 	 ical 	 	story	.
How	to	move	you	with	your	 emotion 	 s 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	make	your	mind	work	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	some	of	the	 image 	 s 	 	and	the	 character 	 s 	 	of	the	film	.
 N 	 ow 	 	 come 	 s 	 	the	green	 move 	 ment 	 	--	the	summer	of	2009	,	 a 	 s 	 	my	film	is	released	--	the	 up 	 ris 	 ing 	 	 begin 	 s 	 	in	the	 street 	 s 	 	of	Tehran	.
What	is	 un 	 believ 	 ably 	 	 iron 	 ic 	 	is	the	period	that	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	depict	in	the	film	,	the	cry	for	 demo 	 cracy 	 	and	social	justice	,	 repeat 	 s 	 	 it 	 self 	 	now	 aga 	 in 	 	in	Tehran	.
The	green	 move 	 ment 	 	 significant 	 ly 	 	inspired	the	world	.
It	 br 	 ought 	 	a	lot	of	attention	to	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 Iranian 	 s 	 	who	stand	for	 bas 	 ic 	 	human	 right 	 s 	 	and	struggle	for	 demo 	 cracy 	 	.
What	was	most	significant	for	me	was	,	once	 aga 	 in 	 	,	the	presence	of	the	women	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 inspiration 	 al 	 	for	me	.
If	in	the	Islamic	 R 	 evolution 	 	,	the	 image 	 s 	 	of	the	woman	 port 	 ray 	 ed 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 sub 	 mis 	 s 	 ive 	 	and	did	n't	have	a	voice	,	now	we	saw	a	new	idea	of	 femin 	 ism 	 	in	the	 street 	 s 	 	of	Tehran	--	women	who	 we 	 re 	 	educated	,	forward	 think 	 ing 	 	,	 non 	 - 	 tradition 	 al 	 	,	 sexual 	 ly 	 	open	,	 fear 	 less 	 	and	 serious 	 ly 	 	feminist	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	women	and	 t 	 hose 	 	young	men	 unit 	 ed 	 	 Iranian 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	world	,	 in 	 side 	 	and	 out 	 side 	 	.
I	then	 discover 	 ed 	 	why	I	take	so	much	inspiration	from	Iranian	women	.
That	,	under	all	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	,	they	have	 push 	 ed 	 	the	 bound 	 ary 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	have	 confront 	 ed 	 	the	 author 	 ity 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	have	broken	every	rule	in	the	 small 	 est 	 	and	the	 big 	 gest 	 	way	.
And	once	 aga 	 in 	 	,	they	 prov 	 ed 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
I	stand	here	to	say	that	Iranian	women	have	found	a	new	voice	,	and	 the 	 ir 	 	voice	is	giving	me	my	voice	.
And	it	's	a	great	honor	to	be	an	Iranian	woman	and	an	Iranian	artist	,	even	if	I	have	to	 oper 	 ate 	 	in	the	West	 on 	 ly 	 	for	now	.
Thank	you	so	much	.
We	see	with	the	 eye 	 s 	 	,	but	we	see	with	the	brain	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
And	 see 	 ing 	 	with	the	brain	is	often	 call 	 ed 	 	 imagin 	 ation 	 	.
And	we	are	familiar	with	the	 land 	 scapes 	 	of	our	own	 imagin 	 ation 	 	,	our	 in 	 scapes 	 	.	We	've	lived	with	them	all	our	 live 	 s 	 	.
But	there	are	 al 	 so 	 	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	and	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	are	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	.
 The 	 y 	 	do	n't	seem	to	be	of	our	creation	.
 The 	 y 	 	do	n't	seem	to	be	under	our	control	.
 The 	 y 	 	seem	to	come	from	the	 out 	 side 	 	,	and	to	mimic	 per 	 ception 	 	.
So	I	am	going	to	be	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	,	and	a	 part 	 icular 	 	sort	of	visual	 hallucin 	 ation 	 	which	I	see	among	my	 patient 	 s 	 	.
A	few	 month 	 s 	 	ago	,	I	got	a	phone	call	from	a	 nurs 	 ing 	 	home	where	I	work	.
 The 	 y 	 	told	me	that	one	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 resident 	 s 	 	,	an	old	 lad 	 y 	 	in	her	90s	,	was	 see 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 wonder 	 ed 	 	if	she	'd	gone	 bon 	 ker 	 s 	 	or	,	 be 	 cause 	 	she	was	an	old	 lad 	 y 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	she	'd	had	a	stroke	,	or	 whet 	 her 	 	she	had	Alzheimer	's	.
And	so	they	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	if	I	would	come	and	see	 Rosa 	 lie 	 	,	the	old	 lad 	 y 	 	.
I	went	in	to	see	her	.
It	was	evident	straight	away	that	she	was	 perfect 	 ly 	 	 s 	 ane 	 	and	lucid	and	of	good	 intellig 	 ence 	 	,	but	she	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 start 	 led 	 	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 be 	 wild 	 er 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	she	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
And	she	told	me	--	the	 nurse 	 s 	 	had	n't	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	--	that	she	was	blind	,	that	she	had	 be 	 en 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	blind	from	 ma 	 cular 	 	 de 	 generation 	 	for	five	 year 	 s 	 	.
But	now	,	for	the	last	few	 day 	 s 	 	,	she	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
So	I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	What	sort	of	 thing 	 s 	 	?	''
And	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	People	in	 East 	 ern 	 	dress	,	in	 d 	 rape 	 s 	 	,	 walk 	 ing 	 	up	and	down	 stair 	 s 	 	.
A	man	who	 turn 	 s 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	me	and	 s 	 mile 	 s 	 	.
But	he	 ha 	 s 	 	huge	 tee 	 th 	 	on	one	side	of	his	mouth	.
 Anim 	 al 	 s 	 	too	.
I	see	a	white	building	.	It	's	 snow 	 ing 	 	,	a	soft	snow	.
I	see	 th 	 is 	 	horse	with	a	harness	,	 drag 	 ging 	 	the	snow	away	.
 Th 	 en 	 	,	one	night	,	the	scene	 change 	 s 	 	.
I	see	 cat 	 s 	 	and	 dog 	 s 	 	 walk 	 ing 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	me	.
 The 	 y 	 	come	to	a	certain	point	and	then	stop	.
 Th 	 en 	 	it	 change 	 s 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.
I	see	a	lot	of	children	.	 The 	 y 	 	are	 walk 	 ing 	 	up	and	down	 stair 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	wear	bright	 color 	 s 	 	,	rose	and	blue	,	like	 East 	 ern 	 	dress	.	''
 Some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	before	the	people	come	on	,	she	may	 hallucin 	 ate 	 	pink	and	blue	 square 	 s 	 	on	the	floor	,	which	seem	to	go	up	to	the	 ceil 	 ing 	 	.
I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 I 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	like	a	dream	?	''
And	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	No	,	it	's	not	like	a	dream	.	It	's	like	a	movie	.	''
She	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	It	's	got	color	.	It	's	got	motion	.
But	it	's	 complete 	 ly 	 	silent	,	like	a	silent	movie	.	''
And	she	 s 	 aid 	 	that	it	's	a	 ra 	 ther 	 	 bor 	 ing 	 	movie	.
She	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	All	these	people	with	 East 	 ern 	 	dress	,	 walk 	 ing 	 	up	and	down	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 repetit 	 ive 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 limit 	 ed 	 	.	''
And	she	 ha 	 s 	 	a	sense	of	humor	.
She	 k 	 new 	 	it	was	a	 hallucin 	 ation 	 	.
But	she	was	 frighten 	 ed 	 	.	She	'd	lived	95	 year 	 s 	 	and	she	'd	never	had	a	 hallucin 	 ation 	 	before	.
She	 s 	 aid 	 	that	the	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 un 	 related 	 	to	 any 	 thing 	 	she	was	 think 	 ing 	 	or	 feel 	 ing 	 	or	 do 	 ing 	 	,	that	they	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	come	on	by	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	or	disappear	.
She	had	no	control	over	them	.
She	 s 	 aid 	 	she	did	n't	 recogn 	 ize 	 	any	of	the	people	or	 place 	 s 	 	in	the	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	.
And	 non 	 e 	 	of	the	people	or	the	 animal 	 s 	 	,	well	,	they	all	 seem 	 ed 	 	 obliv 	 ious 	 	of	her	.
And	she	did	n't	know	what	was	going	on	.
She	 wonder 	 ed 	 	if	she	was	going	mad	or	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	her	mind	.
Well	,	I	 examine 	 d 	 	her	 care 	 fully 	 	.
She	was	a	bright	old	 lad 	 y 	 	,	 perfect 	 ly 	 	 s 	 ane 	 	.	She	had	no	medical	 problem 	 s 	 	.
She	was	n't	on	any	 medic 	 ations 	 	which	could	produce	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	.
But	she	was	blind	.
And	I	then	 s 	 aid 	 	to	her	,	``	I	think	I	know	what	you	have	.	''
I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	There	is	a	special	form	of	visual	 hallucin 	 ation 	 	which	may	go	with	 deterio 	 rating 	 	vision	or	 blind 	 ness 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	was	 original 	 ly 	 	 de 	 scribed 	 	,	''	I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	right	back	in	the	18th	century	,	by	a	man	 call 	 ed 	 	 Char 	 les 	 	 B 	 on 	 net 	 	.

There	is	 noth 	 ing 	 	wrong	with	your	brain	.	There	is	 noth 	 ing 	 	wrong	with	your	mind	.
You	have	 Char 	 les 	 	 B 	 on 	 net 	 	syndrome	.	''
And	she	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 reliev 	 ed 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	,	that	there	was	 noth 	 ing 	 	 serious 	 ly 	 	the	matter	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	 cur 	 ious 	 	.
She	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Who	is	 th 	 is 	 	 Char 	 les 	 	 B 	 on 	 net 	 	?	''
She	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Did	he	have	them	 him 	 self 	 	?	''
And	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Tell	all	the	 nurse 	 s 	 	that	I	have	 Char 	 les 	 	 B 	 on 	 net 	 	syndrome	.	''
``	I	'm	not	crazy	.	I	'm	not	 de 	 ment 	 ed 	 	.	I	have	 Char 	 les 	 	 B 	 on 	 net 	 	syndrome	.	''
Well	,	so	I	did	tell	the	 nurse 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	for	me	,	is	a	common	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
I	work	in	 old 	 - 	 age 	 	 home 	 s 	 	,	 large 	 ly 	 	.
I	see	a	lot	of	 elder 	 ly 	 	people	who	are	 hear 	 ing 	 	 impair 	 ed 	 	or	 visual 	 ly 	 	 impair 	 ed 	 	.
 Ab 	 out 	 	10	percent	of	the	 hear 	 ing 	 	 impair 	 ed 	 	people	get	musical	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	.
And	about	10	percent	of	the	 visual 	 ly 	 	 impair 	 ed 	 	people	get	visual	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	.
You	do	n't	have	to	be	 complete 	 ly 	 	blind	,	 on 	 ly 	 	 sufficient 	 ly 	 	 impair 	 ed 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	with	the	original	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	in	the	18th	century	,	 Char 	 les 	 	 B 	 on 	 net 	 	did	not	have	them	.
 Hi 	 s 	 	 grand 	 father 	 	had	these	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	.
 Hi 	 s 	 	 grand 	 father 	 	was	a	 magist 	 rate 	 	,	an	 elder 	 ly 	 	man	.
He	'd	had	cataract	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	.
 Hi 	 s 	 	vision	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	poor	.
And	in	1759	,	he	 de 	 scribed 	 	to	his	 grand 	 son 	 	 vari 	 ous 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	he	was	 see 	 ing 	 	.
The	first	thing	he	 s 	 aid 	 	was	he	saw	a	handkerchief	in	 mid 	 air 	 	.
It	was	a	large	blue	handkerchief	with	four	 o 	 range 	 	 circle 	 s 	 	.
And	he	 k 	 new 	 	it	was	a	 hallucin 	 ation 	 	.
You	do	n't	have	 handkerchief 	 s 	 	in	 mid 	 air 	 	.
And	then	he	saw	a	big	wheel	in	 mid 	 air 	 	.
But	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	he	was	n't	 s 	 ure 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	he	was	 hallucin 	 ating 	 	or	not	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	would	fit	in	the	 con 	 text 	 	of	the	 vision 	 s 	 	.
So	on	one	occasion	,	when	his	 grand 	 daughter 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 visit 	 ing 	 	them	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	And	who	are	these	 hand 	 some 	 	young	men	with	you	?	''
And	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 Al 	 a 	 s 	 	,	 Grand 	 papa 	 	,	there	are	no	 hand 	 some 	 	young	men	.	''
And	then	the	 hand 	 some 	 	young	men	 disappear 	 ed 	 	.
It	's	typical	of	these	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	that	they	may	come	in	a	flash	and	disappear	in	a	flash	.
 The 	 y 	 	do	n't	 usual 	 ly 	 	 fad 	 e 	 	in	and	out	.
 The 	 y 	 	are	 ra 	 ther 	 	sudden	,	and	they	change	 sudden 	 ly 	 	.
 Char 	 les 	 	 L 	 ull 	 in 	 	,	the	 grand 	 father 	 	,	saw	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	different	 figure 	 s 	 	,	different	 land 	 scapes 	 	of	all	 sort 	 s 	 	.
On	one	occasion	,	he	saw	a	man	in	a	 bath 	 robe 	 	 smok 	 ing 	 	a	pipe	,	and	 real 	 ized 	 	it	was	 him 	 self 	 	.
That	was	the	 on 	 ly 	 	figure	he	 recogn 	 ized 	 	.
On	one	occasion	when	he	was	 walk 	 ing 	 	in	the	 street 	 s 	 	of	Paris	,	he	saw	--	 th 	 is 	 	was	real	--	a	 scaffold 	 ing 	 	.
But	when	he	got	back	home	,	he	saw	a	 miniatur 	 e 	 	of	the	 scaffold 	 ing 	 	six	 inch 	 es 	 	high	,	on	his	 stud 	 y 	 	table	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 re 	 petition 	 	of	 per 	 ception 	 	is	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 pal 	 inopsia 	 	.
With	him	and	with	 Rosa 	 lie 	 	,	what	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	going	on	--	and	 Rosa 	 lie 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	What	's	going	on	?	''	--	and	I	 s 	 aid 	 	that	 a 	 s 	 	you	lose	vision	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	visual	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	brain	are	no	 long 	 er 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	any	 in 	 put 	 	,	they	 be 	 come 	 	 hyper 	 active 	 	and	 excit 	 able 	 	,	and	they	start	to	fire	 spontane 	 ously 	 	.
And	you	start	to	see	 thing 	 s 	 	.
The	 thing 	 s 	 	you	see	can	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	.
With	 an 	 other 	 	patient	of	mine	,	who	,	 al 	 so 	 	had	some	vision	,	the	vision	she	had	could	be	 disturb 	 ing 	 	.
On	one	occasion	,	she	 s 	 aid 	 	she	saw	a	man	in	a	 strip 	 ed 	 	shirt	in	a	restaurant	.
And	he	 turn 	 ed 	 	around	.	And	then	he	 divid 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	six	 figure 	 s 	 	in	 strip 	 ed 	 	 shirt 	 s 	 	,	who	 start 	 ed 	 	 walk 	 ing 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	her	.
And	then	the	six	 figure 	 s 	 	came	together	 aga 	 in 	 	,	like	a	 concert 	 ina 	 	.
 O 	 nce 	 	,	when	she	was	 driv 	 ing 	 	,	or	 ra 	 ther 	 	,	her	husband	was	 driv 	 ing 	 	,	the	road	 divid 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	four	and	she	felt	 her 	 self 	 	going	 simultaneous 	 ly 	 	up	four	 road 	 s 	 	.
She	had	 ver 	 y 	 	mobile	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
A	lot	of	them	had	to	do	with	a	car	.
 Some 	 time 	 s 	 	she	would	see	a	 teen 	 age 	 	boy	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	on	the	hood	of	the	car	.
He	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 ten 	 acious 	 	and	he	 move 	 d 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	 grace 	 fully 	 	when	the	car	 turn 	 ed 	 	.
And	then	when	they	came	to	a	stop	,	the	boy	would	do	a	sudden	 vert 	 ical 	 	 take 	 off 	 	,	100	foot	in	the	air	,	and	then	disappear	.
 An 	 other 	 	patient	of	mine	had	a	different	sort	of	 hallucin 	 ation 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	was	a	woman	who	did	n't	have	trouble	with	her	 eye 	 s 	 	,	but	the	visual	 part 	 s 	 	of	her	brain	,	a	little	tumor	in	the	 occip 	 ital 	 	cortex	.
And	,	above	all	,	she	would	see	 cartoon 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	 cartoon 	 s 	 	would	be	 trans 	 parent 	 	and	would	cover	half	the	visual	field	,	like	a	screen	.
And	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	she	saw	 cartoon 	 s 	 	of	 Ker 	 mit 	 	the	Frog	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	I	do	n't	watch	 Se 	 same 	 	Street	,	but	she	made	a	point	of	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	Why	 Ker 	 mit 	 	?	''	She	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 Ker 	 mit 	 	the	Frog	 mean 	 s 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	me	.
You	know	,	I	was	 wonder 	 ing 	 	about	 Freud 	 ian 	 	 determi 	 nant 	 s 	 	.
Why	 Ker 	 mit 	 	?
 Ker 	 mit 	 	the	Frog	 mean 	 s 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	me	.	''
She	did	n't	mind	the	 cartoon 	 s 	 	too	much	.
But	what	did	disturb	her	was	she	got	 ver 	 y 	 	 persist 	 ent 	 	 image 	 s 	 	or	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	of	 face 	 s 	 	and	 a 	 s 	 	with	 Rosa 	 lie 	 	,	the	 face 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	often	 de 	 form 	 ed 	 	,	with	 ver 	 y 	 	large	 tee 	 th 	 	or	 ver 	 y 	 	large	 eye 	 s 	 	.
And	these	 frighten 	 ed 	 	her	.
Well	,	what	is	going	on	with	these	people	?
 A 	 s 	 	a	physician	,	I	have	to	try	and	define	what	's	going	on	,	and	to	 re 	 assure 	 	people	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	to	 re 	 assure 	 	them	that	they	're	not	going	 insan 	 e 	 	.
 Some 	 thing 	 	like	10	percent	,	 a 	 s 	 	I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	of	 visual 	 ly 	 	 impair 	 ed 	 	people	get	these	.
But	no	more	than	one	percent	of	the	people	 acknowledg 	 e 	 	them	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	are	 af 	 raid 	 	they	will	be	 s 	 een 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 insan 	 e 	 	or	 some 	 thing 	 	.
And	if	they	do	 ment 	 ion 	 	them	to	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 doctor 	 s 	 	they	may	be	 mis 	 diagnos 	 ed 	 	.
In	 part 	 icular 	 	,	the	 not 	 ion 	 	is	that	if	you	see	 thing 	 s 	 	or	hear	 thing 	 s 	 	,	you	're	going	mad	,	but	the	 psycho 	 tic 	 	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	are	 quit 	 e 	 	different	.
 Psycho 	 tic 	 	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	they	are	visual	or	vocal	,	they	address	you	.	 The 	 y 	 	 accus 	 e 	 	you	.
 The 	 y 	 	seduce	you	.	 The 	 y 	 	 humil 	 iate 	 	you	.
 The 	 y 	 	 j 	 eer 	 	at	you	.
You	interact	with	them	.
There	is	 non 	 e 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	quality	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 address 	 ed 	 	with	these	 Char 	 les 	 	 B 	 on 	 net 	 	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	.
There	is	a	film	.	You	're	 see 	 ing 	 	a	film	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	you	,	or	that	's	how	people	think	about	it	.
There	is	 al 	 so 	 	a	rare	thing	 call 	 ed 	 	temporal	lobe	epilepsy	,	and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	if	one	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	one	may	feel	 one 	 self 	 	 transport 	 ed 	 	back	to	a	time	and	place	in	the	past	.
You	're	at	a	 part 	 icular 	 	road	junction	.
You	smell	 chest 	 nuts 	 	 roast 	 ing 	 	.
You	hear	the	traffic	.	All	the	 sense 	 s 	 	are	 involve 	 d 	 	.
And	you	're	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	your	girl	.
And	it	's	that	 Tu 	 es 	 day 	 	 even 	 ing 	 	back	in	1982	.
And	the	temporal	lobe	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	are	 all 	 - 	 sense 	 	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	,	full	of	 feel 	 ing 	 	,	full	of	 familiar 	 ity 	 	,	 locate 	 d 	 	in	space	and	time	,	 cohere 	 nt 	 	,	 dramat 	 ic 	 	.
The	 Char 	 les 	 	 B 	 on 	 net 	 	 one 	 s 	 	are	 quit 	 e 	 	different	.
So	in	the	 Char 	 les 	 	 B 	 on 	 net 	 	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	,	you	have	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 level 	 s 	 	,	from	the	 geo 	 metric 	 al 	 	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	--	the	pink	and	blue	 square 	 s 	 	the	woman	had	--	up	to	 quit 	 e 	 	elaborate	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	with	 figure 	 s 	 	and	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 face 	 s 	 	.
 Face 	 s 	 	,	and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 de 	 form 	 ed 	 	 face 	 s 	 	,	are	the	single	 common 	 est 	 	thing	in	these	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	.
And	one	of	the	second	 common 	 est 	 	is	 cartoon 	 s 	 	.
So	,	what	is	going	on	?
 Fascinat 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	in	the	last	few	 year 	 s 	 	,	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	possible	to	do	functional	brain	 image 	 ry 	 	,	to	do	 f 	 MRI 	 	on	people	 a 	 s 	 	they	are	 hallucin 	 ating 	 	.
And	in	fact	,	to	find	that	different	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	visual	brain	are	 activate 	 d 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	are	 hallucin 	 ating 	 	.
When	people	have	these	simple	 geo 	 metric 	 al 	 	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	,	the	 prim 	 ary 	 	visual	cortex	is	 activate 	 d 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	part	of	the	brain	which	 perceive 	 s 	 	 edge 	 s 	 	and	 pattern 	 s 	 	.
You	do	n't	form	 image 	 s 	 	with	your	 prim 	 ary 	 	visual	cortex	.
When	 image 	 s 	 	are	 form 	 ed 	 	,	a	 high 	 er 	 	part	of	the	visual	cortex	is	 involve 	 d 	 	in	the	temporal	lobe	.
And	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	one	area	of	the	temporal	lobe	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 f 	 usi 	 form 	 	 gy 	 rus 	 	.
And	it	's	known	that	if	people	have	damage	in	the	 f 	 usi 	 form 	 	 gy 	 rus 	 	,	they	 may 	 be 	 	lose	the	ability	to	 recogn 	 ize 	 	 face 	 s 	 	.
But	if	there	is	an	 ab 	 normal 	 	activity	in	the	 f 	 usi 	 form 	 	 gy 	 rus 	 	,	they	may	 hallucin 	 ate 	 	 face 	 s 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	you	find	in	some	of	these	people	.
There	is	an	area	in	the	 an 	 terior 	 	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	 gy 	 rus 	 	where	 tee 	 th 	 	and	 eye 	 s 	 	are	 represent 	 ed 	 	,	and	that	part	of	the	 gy 	 rus 	 	is	 activate 	 d 	 	when	people	get	the	 de 	 form 	 ed 	 	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	.
There	is	 an 	 other 	 	part	of	the	brain	which	is	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 activate 	 d 	 	when	one	 s 	 ees 	 	 cartoon 	 s 	 	.
It	's	 activate 	 d 	 	when	one	 recogn 	 ize 	 s 	 	 cartoon 	 s 	 	,	when	one	 draw 	 s 	 	 cartoon 	 s 	 	,	and	when	one	 hallucin 	 ates 	 	them	.
It	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	that	that	should	be	specific	.
There	are	other	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	brain	which	are	 specific 	 ally 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	with	the	 re 	 cognition 	 	and	 hallucin 	 ation 	 	of	 building 	 s 	 	and	 land 	 scapes 	 	.
 A 	 round 	 	1970	,	it	was	found	that	there	 we 	 re 	 	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	brain	,	but	 part 	 icular 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	.
``	Face	 cell 	 s 	 	''	 we 	 re 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	around	1970	.
And	now	we	know	that	there	are	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	other	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 cell 	 s 	 	,	which	can	be	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	specific	.
So	you	may	not	 on 	 ly 	 	have	``	car	''	 cell 	 s 	 	,	you	may	have	``	 A 	 s 	 ton 	 	 Mart 	 in 	 	''	 cell 	 s 	 	.
I	saw	an	 A 	 s 	 ton 	 	 Mart 	 in 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
I	had	to	 br 	 ing 	 	it	in	.
And	now	it	's	in	there	 some 	 where 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	at	 th 	 is 	 	level	,	in	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 infer 	 o 	 temporal 	 	cortex	,	there	are	 on 	 ly 	 	visual	 image 	 s 	 	,	or	 fig 	 ments 	 	or	 fragment 	 s 	 	.
It	's	 on 	 ly 	 	at	 high 	 er 	 	 level 	 s 	 	that	the	other	 sense 	 s 	 	join	in	and	there	are	 connect 	 ions 	 	with	 memor 	 y 	 	and	emotion	.
And	in	the	 Char 	 les 	 	 B 	 on 	 net 	 	syndrome	,	you	do	n't	go	to	 t 	 hose 	 	 high 	 er 	 	 level 	 s 	 	.
You	're	in	these	 level 	 s 	 	of	 infer 	 ior 	 	visual	cortex	where	you	have	 thousand 	 s 	 	and	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	and	 million 	 s 	 	of	 image 	 s 	 	,	or	 fig 	 ments 	 	,	or	 fragment 	 ary 	 	 fig 	 ments 	 	,	all	 neural 	 ly 	 	 encode 	 d 	 	in	 part 	 icular 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	or	small	 cluster 	 s 	 	of	 cell 	 s 	 	.
 Nor 	 mal 	 ly 	 	these	are	all	part	of	the	 integrate 	 d 	 	stream	of	 per 	 ception 	 	,	or	 imagin 	 ation 	 	,	and	one	is	not	conscious	of	them	.
It	is	 on 	 ly 	 	if	one	is	 visual 	 ly 	 	 impair 	 ed 	 	or	blind	that	the	process	is	 interrupt 	 ed 	 	.
And	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 get 	 ting 	 	normal	 per 	 ception 	 	,	you	're	 get 	 ting 	 	an	 anarch 	 ic 	 	,	 convuls 	 ive 	 	 stimul 	 ation 	 	,	or	 re 	 lease 	 	,	of	all	of	these	visual	 cell 	 s 	 	in	the	 infer 	 o 	 temporal 	 	cortex	.
So	,	 sudden 	 ly 	 	you	see	a	face	.	 Sud 	 den 	 ly 	 	you	see	a	car	.
 Sud 	 den 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	 sudden 	 ly 	 	that	.
The	mind	 do 	 es 	 	 it 	 s 	 	best	to	organize	and	to	give	some	sort	of	 cohere 	 nce 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	not	 terr 	 ibly 	 	 success 	 fully 	 	.
When	these	 we 	 re 	 	first	 de 	 scribed 	 	,	it	was	thought	that	they	could	be	 interpret 	 ed 	 	like	 dream 	 s 	 	.
But	in	fact	people	say	,	``	I	do	n't	 recogn 	 ize 	 	the	people	.	I	ca	n't	form	any	 associ 	 ations 	 	.	''
``	 Ker 	 mit 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	me	.	''
You	do	n't	get	 any 	 where 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	of	them	 a 	 s 	 	 dream 	 s 	 	.
Well	,	I	've	more	or	less	 s 	 aid 	 	what	I	 want 	 ed 	 	.
I	think	I	just	want	to	recapitulate	and	say	 th 	 is 	 	is	common	.
Think	of	the	number	of	blind	people	.
There	must	be	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	blind	people	who	have	these	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	,	but	are	too	 scar 	 ed 	 	to	 ment 	 ion 	 	them	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	thing	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	 br 	 ought 	 	 in 	 to 	 	notice	,	for	 patient 	 s 	 	,	for	 doctor 	 s 	 	,	for	the	public	.
 Fin 	 ally 	 	,	I	think	they	are	 infinite 	 ly 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	and	 valu 	 able 	 	,	for	giving	one	some	 in 	 sight 	 	 a 	 s 	 	to	how	the	brain	 work 	 s 	 	.
 Char 	 les 	 	 B 	 on 	 net 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	250	 year 	 s 	 	ago	--	he	 wonder 	 ed 	 	how	,	 think 	 ing 	 	these	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	,	how	,	 a 	 s 	 	he	put	it	,	the	theater	of	the	mind	could	be	generated	by	the	 machine 	 ry 	 	of	the	brain	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	250	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	I	think	we	're	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	 glimps 	 e 	 	how	 th 	 is 	 	is	 d 	 one 	 	.
 Thank 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
Chris	 And 	 er 	 son 	 	:	That	was	 super 	 b 	 	.	Thank	you	so	much	.
You	speak	about	these	 thing 	 s 	 	with	so	much	 in 	 sight 	 	and	 empath 	 y 	 	for	your	 patient 	 s 	 	.
 Hav 	 e 	 	you	 your 	 self 	 	 experience 	 d 	 	any	of	the	 syndrome 	 s 	 	you	write	about	?
 O 	 liver 	 	Sacks	:	I	was	 af 	 raid 	 	you	'd	ask	that	.
Well	,	 yea 	 h 	 	,	a	lot	of	them	.
And	 actual 	 ly 	 	I	'm	a	little	 visual 	 ly 	 	 impair 	 ed 	 	 my 	 self 	 	.
I	'm	blind	in	one	eye	,	and	not	 terr 	 ibly 	 	good	in	the	other	.
And	I	see	the	 geo 	 metric 	 al 	 	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	.
But	they	stop	there	.
CA	:	And	they	do	n't	disturb	you	?
 Be 	 cause 	 	you	understand	what	's	 do 	 ing 	 	it	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	you	 worri 	 ed 	 	?
OS	:	Well	they	do	n't	disturb	me	any	more	than	my	 tin 	 nit 	 us 	 	,	which	I	 ignor 	 e 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	 occasion 	 ally 	 	interest	me	,	and	I	have	 man 	 y 	 	 picture 	 s 	 	of	them	in	my	 note 	 book 	 s 	 	.
I	've	gone	and	had	an	 f 	 MRI 	 	 my 	 self 	 	,	to	see	how	my	visual	cortex	is	taking	over	.
And	when	I	see	all	these	 hexagon 	 s 	 	and	complex	 thing 	 s 	 	,	which	I	 al 	 so 	 	have	,	in	visual	migraine	,	I	wonder	 whet 	 her 	 	 every 	 one 	 	 s 	 ees 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	 whet 	 her 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	cave	art	or	 orna 	 mental 	 	art	may	have	 be 	 en 	 	derived	from	them	a	bit	.

But	what	we	're	going	to	talk	about	in	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	we	're	going	to	the	next	level	.
But	before	I	do	that	,	I	want	to	talk	a	little	bit	about	 re 	 ally 	 	just	how	I	got	 start 	 ed 	 	.
And	some	of	you	all	might	know	,	about	five	 year 	 s 	 	ago	I	was	an	analyst	at	a	 hedg 	 e 	 	fund	,	and	I	was	in	 Bo 	 s 	 ton 	 	,	and	I	was	 tutor 	 ing 	 	my	 cousin 	 s 	 	in	New	Orleans	,	 remote 	 ly 	 	.
And	I	 start 	 ed 	 	 put 	 ting 	 	the	first	YouTube	 video 	 s 	 	up	 re 	 ally 	 	just	 a 	 s 	 	a	kind	of	 nice 	 - 	 to 	 - 	 have 	 	,	just	a	supplement	for	my	 cousin 	 s 	 	--	 some 	 thing 	 	that	might	give	them	a	 re 	 fresh 	 er 	 	or	 some 	 thing 	 	.
And	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	I	put	 t 	 hose 	 	first	YouTube	 video 	 s 	 	up	,	 some 	 thing 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	bunch	of	 interest 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
The	first	was	the	 feed 	 back 	 	from	my	 cousin 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	told	me	that	they	 prefer 	 red 	 	me	on	YouTube	than	in	person	.
And	once	you	get	over	the	 back 	 hand 	 ed 	 	nature	of	that	,	there	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 pro 	 found 	 	there	.
 The 	 y 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	that	they	 prefer 	 red 	 	the	 autom 	 ated 	 	version	of	 the 	 ir 	 	cousin	to	 the 	 ir 	 	cousin	.
At	first	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 intuitive 	 	,	but	when	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	think	about	it	from	 the 	 ir 	 	point	of	view	,	it	 make 	 s 	 	a	ton	of	sense	.
You	have	 th 	 is 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	where	now	they	can	pause	and	repeat	 the 	 ir 	 	cousin	,	 with 	 out 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	like	they	're	 was 	 ting 	 	my	time	.
If	they	have	to	review	 some 	 thing 	 	that	they	should	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	a	couple	of	 week 	 s 	 	ago	,	or	 may 	 be 	 	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	they	do	n't	have	to	be	 embarrass 	 ed 	 	and	ask	 the 	 ir 	 	cousin	.
 The 	 y 	 	can	just	watch	 t 	 hose 	 	 video 	 s 	 	.	If	they	're	 bor 	 ed 	 	,	they	can	go	 a 	 head 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	can	watch	it	at	 the 	 ir 	 	own	time	,	at	 the 	 ir 	 	own	pace	.
And	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	 l 	 east 	 	 appreciate 	 d 	 	 a 	 spect 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 not 	 ion 	 	that	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	time	,	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	time	that	you	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	your	brain	around	a	new	 con 	 cept 	 	,	the	 ver 	 y 	 	last	thing	you	need	is	 an 	 other 	 	human	 be 	 ing 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	Do	you	understand	 th 	 is 	 	?	''
And	that	's	what	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	with	the	 interact 	 ion 	 	with	my	 cousin 	 s 	 	before	,	and	now	they	can	just	do	it	in	the	 in 	 timacy 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	room	.
The	other	thing	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	is	--	I	put	them	on	YouTube	just	--	I	saw	no	reason	to	make	it	private	,	so	I	let	other	people	watch	it	,	and	then	people	 start 	 ed 	 	 s 	 tumbling 	 	on	it	,	and	I	 start 	 ed 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	some	 comment 	 s 	 	and	some	 letter 	 s 	 	and	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 feed 	 back 	 	from	random	people	from	around	the	world	.
And	these	are	just	a	few	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	from	one	of	the	original	 calcul 	 us 	 	 video 	 s 	 	.
And	 some 	 one 	 	wrote	just	on	YouTube	--	it	was	a	YouTube	comment	:	``	First	time	I	 smil 	 ed 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	a	 deriv 	 ative 	 	.	''
And	let	's	pause	here	.
 Th 	 is 	 	person	did	a	 deriv 	 ative 	 	and	then	they	 smil 	 ed 	 	.
And	then	in	a	 respons 	 e 	 	to	that	same	comment	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	on	the	 th 	 read 	 	.
You	can	go	on	YouTube	and	look	at	these	 comment 	 s 	 	--	 some 	 one 	 	else	wrote	:	``	 Sam 	 e 	 	thing	here	.
I	 actual 	 ly 	 	got	a	natural	high	and	a	good	mood	for	the	entire	day	.
Since	I	remember	 see 	 ing 	 	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	 m 	 atrix 	 	text	in	class	,	and	here	I	'm	all	like	,	'I	know	 k 	 ung 	 	fu	.	'	''	And	we	get	a	lot	of	 feed 	 back 	 	all	 a 	 long 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	lines	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 clear 	 ly 	 	was	 help 	 ing 	 	people	.
But	then	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	 view 	 er 	 ship 	 	 ke 	 pt 	 	growing	and	 ke 	 pt 	 	growing	,	I	 start 	 ed 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 letter 	 s 	 	from	people	,	and	it	was	 start 	 ing 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	clear	that	it	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	more	than	just	a	 nice 	 - 	 to 	 - 	 have 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	just	an	excerpt	from	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 letter 	 s 	 	.
``	My	12	 year 	 - 	 old 	 	son	 ha 	 s 	 	 aut 	 ism 	 	and	 ha 	 s 	 	had	a	 terr 	 ible 	 	time	with	math	.
We	have	 tri 	 ed 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	,	 view 	 ed 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	,	 b 	 ought 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	.
We	 s 	 tumble 	 d 	 	on	your	video	on	 decimal 	 s 	 	and	it	got	through	.
 Th 	 en 	 	we	went	on	to	the	 dread 	 ed 	 	 fraction 	 s 	 	.	 Aga 	 in 	 	,	he	got	it	.
We	could	not	 believ 	 e 	 	it	.
He	is	so	 excit 	 ed 	 	.	''
And	so	you	can	imagine	,	here	I	was	an	analyst	at	a	 hedg 	 e 	 	fund	.
It	was	 ver 	 y 	 	strange	for	me	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	of	social	value	.
But	I	was	 excit 	 ed 	 	,	so	I	 ke 	 pt 	 	going	.
And	then	a	few	other	 thing 	 s 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	to	dawn	on	me	.
That	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	would	it	help	my	 cousin 	 s 	 	right	now	,	or	these	people	who	are	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	 letter 	 s 	 	,	but	that	 th 	 is 	 	content	will	never	go	old	,	that	it	could	help	 the 	 ir 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	or	 the 	 ir 	 	 grand 	 kid 	 s 	 	.
If	 Isa 	 ac 	 	 New 	 ton 	 	had	 d 	 one 	 	YouTube	 video 	 s 	 	on	 calcul 	 us 	 	,	I	would	n't	have	to	.
 Assu 	 ming 	 	he	was	good	.	We	do	n't	know	.
The	other	thing	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	--	and	even	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	,	I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 Oka 	 y 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	it	's	a	good	supplement	.
It	's	good	for	 motiv 	 ated 	 	 student 	 s 	 	.
It	's	good	for	 may 	 be 	 	home	 school 	 ers 	 	.	''
But	I	did	n't	think	it	would	be	 some 	 thing 	 	that	would	 some 	 how 	 	penetrate	the	 class 	 room 	 	.
But	then	I	 start 	 ed 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 letter 	 s 	 	from	 teacher 	 s 	 	.
And	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	would	write	,	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	We	've	used	your	 video 	 s 	 	to	flip	the	 class 	 room 	 	.
You	've	 give 	 n 	 	the	 lectur 	 es 	 	,	so	now	what	we	do	...	``	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	could	happen	in	every	 class 	 room 	 	in	America	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	--	``	...	what	I	do	is	I	assign	the	 lectur 	 es 	 	for	 home 	 work 	 	,	and	what	used	to	be	 home 	 work 	 	,	I	now	have	the	 student 	 s 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	in	the	 class 	 room 	 	.	''
And	I	want	to	pause	here	for	--	I	want	to	pause	here	for	a	second	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	a	couple	of	 interest 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
One	,	when	 t 	 hose 	 	 teacher 	 s 	 	are	 do 	 ing 	 	that	,	there	's	the	obvious	benefit	--	the	benefit	that	now	 the 	 ir 	 	 student 	 s 	 	can	enjoy	the	 video 	 s 	 	in	the	way	that	my	 cousin 	 s 	 	did	.
 The 	 y 	 	can	pause	,	repeat	at	 the 	 ir 	 	own	pace	,	at	 the 	 ir 	 	own	time	.
But	the	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	thing	is	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 un 	 intuitive 	 	thing	when	you	talk	about	technology	in	the	 class 	 room 	 	--	by	 re 	 moving 	 	the	 one 	 - 	 s 	 ize 	 - 	 fit 	 s 	 - 	 all 	 	 lectur 	 e 	 	from	the	 class 	 room 	 	and	 lett 	 ing 	 	 student 	 s 	 	have	a	 self 	 - 	 pac 	 ed 	 	 lectur 	 e 	 	at	home	,	and	then	when	you	go	to	the	 class 	 room 	 	,	 lett 	 ing 	 	them	do	work	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	the	teacher	walk	around	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	the	 peer 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	be	able	to	interact	with	each	other	,	these	 teacher 	 s 	 	have	used	technology	to	 human 	 ize 	 	the	 class 	 room 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	took	a	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	 de 	 human 	 izing 	 	experience	--	30	 kid 	 s 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 finger 	 s 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	lips	,	not	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	interact	with	each	other	.
A	teacher	,	no	matter	how	good	,	 ha 	 s 	 	to	give	 th 	 is 	 	 one 	 - 	 s 	 ize 	 - 	 fit 	 s 	 - 	 all 	 	 lectur 	 e 	 	to	30	 student 	 s 	 	--	blank	 face 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	 ant 	 agon 	 istic 	 	--	and	now	it	's	a	human	experience	.
 N 	 ow 	 	they	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 interact 	 ing 	 	with	each	other	.
So	once	the	Khan	Academy	--	I	quit	my	job	and	we	 turn 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	real	 organ 	 ization 	 	--	we	're	a	 not 	 - 	 for 	 - 	 profit 	 	--	the	question	is	,	how	do	we	take	 th 	 is 	 	to	the	next	level	?
How	do	we	take	what	 t 	 hose 	 	 teacher 	 s 	 	are	 do 	 ing 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	natural	 con 	 clusion 	 	?
And	so	what	I	'm	 show 	 ing 	 	you	over	here	,	these	are	actual	 exercis 	 es 	 	that	I	 start 	 ed 	 	writing	for	my	 cousin 	 s 	 	.
The	 one 	 s 	 	I	 start 	 ed 	 	 we 	 re 	 	much	more	primitive	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	more	 compete 	 nt 	 	version	of	it	.
But	the	paradigm	here	is	,	we	'll	generate	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 question 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	you	need	 un 	 til 	 	you	get	that	 con 	 cept 	 	,	 un 	 til 	 	you	get	10	in	a	row	.
And	the	Khan	Academy	 video 	 s 	 	are	there	.
You	get	 hint 	 s 	 	,	the	actual	 step 	 s 	 	for	that	problem	,	if	you	do	n't	know	how	to	do	it	.
But	the	paradigm	here	,	it	 seem 	 s 	 	like	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	thing	:	10	in	a	row	,	you	move	on	.
But	it	's	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	different	than	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	 class 	 rooms 	 	right	now	.
In	a	 tradition 	 al 	 	 class 	 room 	 	,	you	have	a	couple	of	 home 	 work 	 	,	 home 	 work 	 	,	 lectur 	 e 	 	,	 home 	 work 	 	,	 lectur 	 e 	 	,	and	then	you	have	a	 snap 	 shot 	 	 ex 	 am 	 	.
And	that	 ex 	 am 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	you	get	a	70	percent	,	an	80	percent	,	a	90	percent	or	a	95	percent	,	the	class	 move 	 s 	 	on	to	the	next	 top 	 ic 	 	.
And	even	that	95	percent	student	,	what	was	the	five	percent	they	did	n't	know	?
 May 	 be 	 	they	did	n't	know	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	you	raise	 some 	 thing 	 	to	the	zero	power	.
And	then	you	go	build	on	that	in	the	next	 con 	 cept 	 	.
That	's	 analog 	 ous 	 	to	imagine	 learn 	 ing 	 	to	ride	a	 bi 	 cycle 	 	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	I	give	you	a	 lectur 	 e 	 	 a 	 head 	 	of	time	,	and	I	give	you	that	 bi 	 cycle 	 	for	two	 week 	 s 	 	.
And	then	I	come	back	after	two	 week 	 s 	 	,	and	I	say	,	``	Well	,	let	's	see	.	You	're	 hav 	 ing 	 	trouble	taking	left	 turn 	 s 	 	.
You	ca	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	stop	.
You	're	an	80	percent	 bi 	 cyclist 	 	.	''
So	I	put	a	big	C	stamp	on	your	 fore 	 head 	 	and	then	I	say	,	``	 He 	 re 	 	's	a	 uni 	 cycle 	 	.	''
But	 a 	 s 	 	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	 a 	 s 	 	that	 sound 	 s 	 	,	that	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	our	 class 	 rooms 	 	right	now	.
And	the	idea	is	you	fast	forward	and	good	 student 	 s 	 	start	 fail 	 ing 	 	algebra	all	of	a	sudden	and	start	 fail 	 ing 	 	 calcul 	 us 	 	all	of	a	sudden	,	 de 	 spite 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	smart	,	 de 	 spite 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	good	 teacher 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	 usual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	have	these	Swiss	cheese	 gap 	 s 	 	that	 ke 	 pt 	 	building	 through 	 out 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 found 	 ation 	 	.
So	our	model	is	learn	math	the	way	you	'd	learn	 any 	 thing 	 	,	like	the	way	you	would	learn	a	 bi 	 cycle 	 	.
Stay	on	that	 bi 	 cycle 	 	.	Fall	off	that	 bi 	 cycle 	 	.
Do	it	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	 necess 	 ary 	 	 un 	 til 	 	you	have	 master 	 y 	 	.
The	 tradition 	 al 	 	model	,	it	 penal 	 ize 	 s 	 	you	for	 experiment 	 ation 	 	and	failure	,	but	it	 do 	 es 	 	not	expect	 master 	 y 	 	.
We	 encourag 	 e 	 	you	to	experiment	.	We	 encourag 	 e 	 	you	to	failure	.
But	we	do	expect	 master 	 y 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	just	 an 	 other 	 	one	of	the	 modul 	 es 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 tri 	 go 	 no 	 metry 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	shifting	and	 reflect 	 ing 	 	 function 	 s 	 	.
And	they	all	fit	together	.
We	have	about	90	of	these	right	now	.
And	you	can	go	to	the	 s 	 ite 	 	right	now	.	It	's	all	free	.	Not	 try 	 ing 	 	to	sell	 any 	 thing 	 	.
But	the	general	idea	is	that	they	all	fit	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	knowledge	map	.
That	top	 no 	 de 	 	right	there	,	that	's	 liter 	 ally 	 	single	digit	 add 	 ition 	 	.
It	's	like	one	plus	one	is	equal	to	two	.
And	the	paradigm	is	,	once	you	get	10	in	a	row	on	that	,	it	 keep 	 s 	 	 forward 	 ing 	 	you	to	more	and	more	 advance 	 d 	 	 modul 	 es 	 	.
So	if	you	keep	further	down	the	knowledge	map	,	we	're	 get 	 ting 	 	 in 	 to 	 	more	 advance 	 d 	 	arithmetic	.
 Fur 	 ther 	 	down	,	you	start	 get 	 ting 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 pre 	 - 	 algebra 	 	and	early	algebra	.
 Fur 	 ther 	 	down	,	you	start	 get 	 ting 	 	 in 	 to 	 	algebra	one	,	algebra	two	,	a	little	bit	of	 pre 	 calcul 	 us 	 	.
And	the	idea	is	,	from	 th 	 is 	 	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	teach	 every 	 thing 	 	--	well	,	 every 	 thing 	 	that	can	be	taught	in	 th 	 is 	 	type	of	a	 frame 	 work 	 	.
So	you	can	imagine	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	are	 work 	 ing 	 	on	--	is	from	 th 	 is 	 	knowledge	map	you	have	logic	,	you	have	computer	 programm 	 ing 	 	,	you	have	 gram 	 mar 	 	,	you	have	 genetic 	 s 	 	,	all	based	off	of	that	core	of	,	if	you	know	 th 	 is 	 	and	that	,	now	you	're	ready	for	 th 	 is 	 	next	 con 	 cept 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	that	can	work	well	for	an	individual	 learn 	 er 	 	,	and	I	 encourag 	 e 	 	,	one	,	for	you	to	do	it	with	your	 kid 	 s 	 	,	but	I	 al 	 so 	 	 encourag 	 e 	 	 every 	 one 	 	in	the	audience	to	do	it	 your 	 self 	 	.
It	'll	change	what	 happen 	 s 	 	at	the	 d 	 inner 	 	table	.
But	what	we	want	to	do	is	to	use	the	natural	 con 	 clusion 	 	of	the	 flip 	 ping 	 	of	the	 class 	 room 	 	that	 t 	 hose 	 	early	 teacher 	 s 	 	had	 email 	 ed 	 	me	about	.
And	so	what	I	'm	 show 	 ing 	 	you	here	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	data	from	a	pilot	in	the	 Lo 	 s 	 	 Al 	 to 	 s 	 	school	 di 	 strict 	 	,	where	they	took	two	fifth	grade	 class 	 es 	 	and	two	 seven 	 th 	 	grade	 class 	 es 	 	and	 complete 	 ly 	 	 gutt 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	old	math	curriculum	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	are	n't	using	 text 	 book 	 s 	 	,	they	're	not	 get 	 ting 	 	 one 	 - 	 s 	 ize 	 - 	 fit 	 s 	 - 	 all 	 	 lectur 	 es 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	 do 	 ing 	 	Khan	Academy	,	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	that	 soft 	 ware 	 	,	for	 rough 	 ly 	 	half	of	 the 	 ir 	 	math	class	.
And	I	want	to	make	it	clear	,	we	do	n't	view	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	complete	math	education	.
What	it	 do 	 es 	 	is	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	 Lo 	 s 	 	 Al 	 to 	 s 	 	--	it	 free 	 s 	 	up	time	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	 block 	 ing 	 	and	 tack 	 ling 	 	,	making	 s 	 ure 	 	you	know	how	to	move	through	a	system	of	 equ 	 ations 	 	,	and	it	 free 	 s 	 	up	time	for	the	 simul 	 ations 	 	,	for	the	 game 	 s 	 	,	for	the	 mechanic 	 s 	 	,	for	the	robot	building	,	for	the	estimating	how	high	that	hill	is	based	on	 it 	 s 	 	shadow	.
And	so	the	paradigm	is	the	teacher	 walk 	 s 	 	in	every	day	,	every	kid	 work 	 s 	 	at	 the 	 ir 	 	own	pace	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	live	 dash 	 board 	 	from	 Lo 	 s 	 	 Al 	 to 	 s 	 	school	 di 	 strict 	 	--	and	they	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	 dash 	 board 	 	.
Every	row	is	a	student	.
Every	column	is	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	.
Green	 mean 	 s 	 	the	student	's	 al 	 ready 	 	 profici 	 ent 	 	.
Blue	 mean 	 s 	 	they	're	 work 	 ing 	 	on	it	--	no	need	to	worry	.
Red	 mean 	 s 	 	they	're	 s 	 tuck 	 	.
And	what	the	teacher	 do 	 es 	 	is	 liter 	 ally 	 	just	say	,	``	Let	me	 inter 	 vene 	 	on	the	red	 kid 	 s 	 	.	''
Or	even	better	,	``	Let	me	get	one	of	the	green	 kid 	 s 	 	who	are	 al 	 ready 	 	 profici 	 ent 	 	in	that	 con 	 cept 	 	to	be	the	first	line	of	attack	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	tutor	 the 	 ir 	 	peer	.	''
 N 	 ow 	 	I	come	from	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 data 	 - 	 centric 	 	 re 	 ality 	 	,	so	we	do	n't	want	that	teacher	to	even	go	and	 inter 	 vene 	 	and	have	to	ask	the	kid	awkward	 question 	 s 	 	:	``	Oh	,	what	do	you	not	understand	?	''	or	``	What	do	you	do	understand	?	''
and	all	of	the	rest	.
So	our	paradigm	is	to	 re 	 ally 	 	arm	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	with	 a 	 s 	 	much	data	 a 	 s 	 	possible	--	 re 	 ally 	 	data	that	,	in	 al 	 most 	 	any	other	field	,	is	 expect 	 ed 	 	,	if	you	're	in	finance	or	 market 	 ing 	 	or	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	--	and	so	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	 diagnos 	 e 	 	what	's	wrong	with	the	 student 	 s 	 	so	they	can	make	 the 	 ir 	 	 interact 	 ion 	 	 a 	 s 	 	productive	 a 	 s 	 	possible	.
So	now	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	know	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	the	 student 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	up	to	,	how	long	they	have	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	every	day	,	what	 video 	 s 	 	have	they	 be 	 en 	 	 watch 	 ing 	 	,	when	did	they	pause	the	 video 	 s 	 	,	what	did	they	stop	 watch 	 ing 	 	,	what	 exercis 	 es 	 	are	they	using	,	what	have	they	 be 	 en 	 	focused	on	?
The	 out 	 er 	 	circle	 show 	 s 	 	what	 exercis 	 es 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	focused	on	.
The	inner	circle	 show 	 s 	 	the	 video 	 s 	 	they	're	focused	on	.
And	the	data	 get 	 s 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	granular	so	you	can	see	the	exact	 problem 	 s 	 	that	the	student	got	right	or	wrong	.
Red	is	wrong	,	blue	is	right	.
The	 left 	 most 	 	question	is	the	first	question	that	the	student	 attempt 	 ed 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	 watch 	 ed 	 	the	video	right	over	there	.
And	then	you	can	see	,	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	get	10	in	a	row	.
It	's	 al 	 most 	 	like	you	can	see	them	 learn 	 ing 	 	over	 t 	 hose 	 	last	10	 problem 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	 al 	 so 	 	got	 fast 	 er 	 	.
The	height	is	how	long	it	took	them	.
So	when	you	talk	about	 self 	 - 	 pac 	 ed 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	,	it	 make 	 s 	 	sense	for	 every 	 one 	 	--	in	 education 	 - 	 speak 	 	,	 different 	 iated 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	--	but	it	's	kind	of	crazy	when	you	see	it	in	a	 class 	 room 	 	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	every	time	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	in	every	 class 	 room 	 	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	,	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	,	if	you	go	five	 day 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	it	,	there	's	a	group	of	 kid 	 s 	 	who	've	 rac 	 ed 	 	 a 	 head 	 	and	there	's	a	group	of	 kid 	 s 	 	who	are	a	little	bit	 s 	 lower 	 	.
And	in	a	 tradition 	 al 	 	model	,	if	you	did	a	 snap 	 shot 	 	 assess 	 ment 	 	,	you	say	,	``	 Th 	 ese 	 	are	the	 gift 	 ed 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	,	these	are	the	 s 	 low 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	.
 May 	 be 	 	they	should	be	 track 	 ed 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	.
 May 	 be 	 	we	should	put	them	in	different	 class 	 es 	 	.	''
But	when	you	let	every	student	work	at	 the 	 ir 	 	own	pace	--	and	we	see	it	over	and	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	--	you	see	 student 	 s 	 	who	took	a	little	bit	[	of	]	extra	time	on	one	 con 	 cept 	 	or	the	other	,	but	once	they	get	through	that	 con 	 cept 	 	,	they	just	race	 a 	 head 	 	.
And	so	the	same	 kid 	 s 	 	that	you	thought	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 low 	 	six	 week 	 s 	 	ago	,	you	now	would	think	are	 gift 	 ed 	 	.
And	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	it	over	and	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	.
And	it	 make 	 s 	 	you	 re 	 ally 	 	wonder	how	much	all	of	the	 label 	 s 	 	 may 	 be 	 	a	lot	of	us	have	 benefit 	 ed 	 	from	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	just	due	to	a	 co 	 incidence 	 	of	time	.
 N 	 ow 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 valu 	 able 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	is	in	a	 di 	 strict 	 	like	 Lo 	 s 	 	 Al 	 to 	 s 	 	,	our	goal	is	to	use	technology	to	 human 	 ize 	 	,	not	just	in	 Lo 	 s 	 	 Al 	 to 	 s 	 	,	but	on	a	global	scale	,	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	education	.
And	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	that	kind	of	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	point	.
A	lot	of	the	effort	in	 human 	 izing 	 	the	 class 	 room 	 	is	focused	on	 student 	 - 	 to 	 - 	 teacher 	 	 ratio 	 s 	 	.
In	our	mind	,	the	relevant	metric	is	 student 	 - 	 to 	 - 	 valu 	 able 	 - 	 human 	 - 	 time 	 - 	 	 with 	 - 	 the 	 - 	 teacher 	 	ratio	.
So	in	a	 tradition 	 al 	 	model	,	most	of	the	teacher	's	time	is	 s 	 pent 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 lectur 	 es 	 	and	 grad 	 ing 	 	and	 what 	 not 	 	.
 May 	 be 	 	five	percent	of	 the 	 ir 	 	time	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	next	to	 student 	 s 	 	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	with	them	.
 N 	 ow 	 	100	percent	of	 the 	 ir 	 	time	is	.
So	once	 aga 	 in 	 	,	using	technology	,	not	just	 flip 	 ping 	 	the	 class 	 room 	 	,	you	're	 human 	 izing 	 	the	 class 	 room 	 	,	I	'd	 argu 	 e 	 	,	by	a	factor	of	five	or	10	.
And	 a 	 s 	 	 valu 	 able 	 	 a 	 s 	 	that	is	in	 Lo 	 s 	 	 Al 	 to 	 s 	 	,	imagine	what	that	 do 	 es 	 	to	the	adult	 learn 	 er 	 	who	's	 embarrass 	 ed 	 	to	go	back	and	learn	stuff	that	they	should	have	before	,	before	going	back	to	college	.
 Imagin 	 e 	 	what	it	 do 	 es 	 	to	a	street	kid	in	 Cal 	 cut 	 ta 	 	who	 ha 	 s 	 	to	help	his	family	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	day	,	and	that	's	the	reason	why	he	or	she	ca	n't	go	to	school	.
 N 	 ow 	 	they	can	 s 	 pend 	 	two	 hour 	 s 	 	a	day	and	 re 	 mediate 	 	,	or	get	up	to	speed	and	not	feel	 embarrass 	 ed 	 	about	what	they	do	or	do	n't	know	.
 N 	 ow 	 	imagine	what	 happen 	 s 	 	where	--	we	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	the	 peer 	 s 	 	 teach 	 ing 	 	each	other	 in 	 side 	 	of	a	 class 	 room 	 	.
But	 th 	 is 	 	is	all	one	system	.
There	's	no	reason	why	you	ca	n't	have	that	 peer 	 - 	 to 	 - 	 peer 	 	 tutor 	 ing 	 	beyond	that	one	 class 	 room 	 	.
 Imagin 	 e 	 	what	 happen 	 s 	 	if	that	student	in	 Cal 	 cut 	 ta 	 	all	of	a	sudden	can	tutor	your	son	,	or	your	son	can	tutor	that	kid	in	 Cal 	 cut 	 ta 	 	?
And	I	think	what	you	'll	see	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	of	a	global	 one 	 - 	 world 	 	 class 	 room 	 	.
And	that	's	 essential 	 ly 	 	what	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	build	.
Thank	you	.
Bill	 Gate 	 s 	 	:	I	've	 s 	 een 	 	some	 thing 	 s 	 	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	in	the	system	that	have	to	do	with	 motiv 	 ation 	 	and	 feed 	 back 	 	--	energy	 point 	 s 	 	,	merit	 badge 	 s 	 	.
Tell	me	what	you	're	 think 	 ing 	 	there	.
 S 	 K 	 	:	Oh	 yea 	 h 	 	.	No	,	we	have	an	awesome	team	 work 	 ing 	 	on	it	.
And	I	have	to	make	it	clear	,	it	's	not	just	me	 any 	 more 	 	.
I	'm	still	 do 	 ing 	 	all	the	 video 	 s 	 	,	but	we	have	a	 rock 	 star 	 	team	 do 	 ing 	 	the	 soft 	 ware 	 	.
Yeah	,	we	've	put	a	bunch	of	game	 mechanic 	 s 	 	in	there	where	you	get	these	 badge 	 s 	 	,	we	're	going	to	start	 hav 	 ing 	 	 lead 	 er 	 	 board 	 s 	 	by	area	,	and	you	get	 point 	 s 	 	.
It	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
Just	the	 word 	 ing 	 	of	the	 bad 	 ging 	 	or	how	 man 	 y 	 	 point 	 s 	 	you	get	for	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	,	we	see	on	a	 system 	 - 	 wide 	 	 bas 	 is 	 	,	like	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	fifth	graders	or	sixth	graders	going	one	direction	or	 an 	 other 	 	,	 depend 	 ing 	 	what	badge	you	give	them	.
 B 	 G 	 	:	And	the	 collabor 	 ation 	 	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	with	 Lo 	 s 	 	 Al 	 to 	 s 	 	,	how	did	that	come	about	?
 S 	 K 	 	:	 Lo 	 s 	 	 Al 	 to 	 s 	 	,	it	was	kind	of	crazy	.
 O 	 nce 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	,	I	did	n't	expect	it	to	be	used	in	 class 	 rooms 	 	.
 Some 	 one 	 	from	 the 	 ir 	 	board	came	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	What	would	you	do	if	you	had	 cart 	 e 	 	blanche	in	a	 class 	 room 	 	?	''
And	I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Well	,	I	would	just	,	every	student	work	at	 the 	 ir 	 	own	pace	on	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	and	we	'd	give	a	 dash 	 board 	 	.	''
And	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Oh	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	kind	of	radical	.	We	have	to	think	about	it	.	''
And	me	and	the	rest	of	the	team	 we 	 re 	 	like	,	``	 The 	 y 	 	're	never	going	to	want	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.	''
But	 liter 	 ally 	 	the	next	day	they	 we 	 re 	 	like	,	``	Can	you	start	in	two	 week 	 s 	 	?	''
 B 	 G 	 	:	So	fifth	grade	math	is	where	that	's	going	on	right	now	?
 S 	 K 	 	:	It	's	two	fifth	grade	 class 	 es 	 	and	two	 seven 	 th 	 	grade	 class 	 es 	 	.
And	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	it	at	the	 di 	 strict 	 	level	.
I	think	what	they	're	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	is	they	can	now	follow	these	 kid 	 s 	 	.
It	's	not	an	 on 	 ly 	 - 	 in 	 - 	 school 	 	thing	.
We	've	even	,	on	 Christ 	 ma 	 s 	 	,	we	saw	some	of	the	 kid 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
And	we	can	track	 every 	 thing 	 	.
So	they	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	track	them	 a 	 s 	 	they	go	through	the	entire	 di 	 strict 	 	.
 Th 	 rough 	 	the	 summer 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	they	go	from	one	teacher	to	the	next	,	you	have	 th 	 is 	 	 continu 	 ity 	 	of	data	that	even	at	the	 di 	 strict 	 	level	they	can	see	.
 B 	 G 	 	:	So	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 view 	 s 	 	we	saw	 we 	 re 	 	for	the	teacher	to	go	in	and	track	 actual 	 ly 	 	what	's	going	on	with	 t 	 hose 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	.
So	you	're	 get 	 ting 	 	 feed 	 back 	 	on	 t 	 hose 	 	teacher	 view 	 s 	 	to	see	what	they	think	they	mean	?
 S 	 K 	 	:	Oh	 yea 	 h 	 	.	 Mo 	 st 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 spec 	 s 	 	by	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	.
We	made	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	for	 student 	 s 	 	so	they	could	see	 the 	 ir 	 	data	,	but	we	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	tight	design	loop	with	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
And	they	're	 liter 	 ally 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	Hey	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	nice	,	but	...	``	Like	that	focus	graph	,	a	lot	of	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	I	have	a	 feel 	 ing 	 	that	a	lot	of	the	 kid 	 s 	 	are	 jump 	 ing 	 	around	and	not	 focus 	 ing 	 	on	one	 top 	 ic 	 	.	''
So	we	made	that	focus	 dia 	 gram 	 	.
So	it	's	all	 be 	 en 	 	 teacher 	 - 	 driven 	 	.
It	's	 be 	 en 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	crazy	.
 B 	 G 	 	:	 I 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	ready	for	prime	time	?
Do	you	think	a	lot	of	 class 	 es 	 	next	school	year	should	try	 th 	 is 	 	thing	out	?
 S 	 K 	 	:	Yeah	,	it	's	ready	.
We	've	got	a	million	people	on	the	 s 	 ite 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	,	so	we	can	handle	a	few	more	.
No	,	no	reason	why	it	 re 	 ally 	 	ca	n't	happen	in	every	 class 	 room 	 	in	America	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	.
 B 	 G 	 	:	And	the	vision	of	the	 tutor 	 ing 	 	thing	.
The	idea	there	is	,	if	I	'm	 con 	 fused 	 	about	a	 top 	 ic 	 	,	 some 	 how 	 	right	in	the	user	 inter 	 face 	 	I	'd	find	people	who	are	 volunteer 	 ing 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	see	 the 	 ir 	 	reputation	,	and	I	could	schedule	and	connect	up	with	 t 	 hose 	 	people	?
 S 	 K 	 	:	 Absolute 	 ly 	 	.	And	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	I	recommend	 every 	 one 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	audience	to	do	.
 T 	 hose 	 	 dash 	 board 	 s 	 	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	have	,	you	can	go	log	in	right	now	and	you	can	 essential 	 ly 	 	 be 	 come 	 	a	coach	for	your	 kid 	 s 	 	,	or	 nephew 	 s 	 	,	or	 cousin 	 s 	 	,	or	 may 	 be 	 	some	 kid 	 s 	 	at	the	 Boy 	 s 	 	and	 Girl 	 s 	 	Club	.
And	 yea 	 h 	 	,	you	can	start	 be 	 coming 	 	a	mentor	,	a	tutor	,	But	 yea 	 h 	 	,	it	's	all	there	.
 B 	 G 	 	:	Well	,	it	's	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
I	think	you	just	got	a	 glimps 	 e 	 	of	the	future	of	education	.
Thank	you	.
So	I	want	to	take	you	on	a	trip	to	an	alien	world	.
And	it	's	not	a	trip	that	 requir 	 es 	 	 light 	 - 	 year 	 s 	 	of	travel	,	but	it	's	to	a	place	where	it	's	defined	by	light	.
So	it	's	a	 little 	 - 	 appreciate 	 d 	 	fact	that	most	of	the	 animal 	 s 	 	in	our	ocean	make	light	.
I	've	 s 	 pent 	 	most	of	my	 care 	 er 	 	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 phenomen 	 on 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nce 	 	.
I	 stud 	 y 	 	it	 be 	 cause 	 	I	think	 understand 	 ing 	 	it	is	critical	to	 understand 	 ing 	 	life	in	the	ocean	where	most	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nce 	 	 occur 	 s 	 	.
I	 al 	 so 	 	use	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	tool	for	 visual 	 izing 	 	and	 track 	 ing 	 	 poll 	 ution 	 	.
But	 most 	 ly 	 	I	'm	 en 	 trance 	 d 	 	by	it	.
Since	my	my	first	 d 	 ive 	 	in	a	 deep 	 - 	 div 	 ing 	 	submersible	,	when	I	went	down	and	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	the	 light 	 s 	 	and	saw	the	 fire 	 work 	 s 	 	 dis 	 play 	 s 	 	,	I	've	 be 	 en 	 	a	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nce 	 	 junk 	 y 	 	.
But	I	would	come	back	from	 t 	 hose 	 	 div 	 es 	 	and	try	to	share	the	experience	with	 word 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 total 	 ly 	 	 in 	 ad 	 equate 	 	to	the	task	.
I	 need 	 ed 	 	some	way	to	share	the	experience	 direct 	 ly 	 	.
And	the	first	time	I	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	that	way	was	in	 th 	 is 	 	little	 single 	 - 	 person 	 	submersible	 call 	 ed 	 	 De 	 ep 	 	 R 	 over 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	next	video	clip	,	you	're	going	to	see	how	we	 stimul 	 ated 	 	the	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nce 	 	.
And	the	first	thing	you	're	going	to	see	is	a	 trans 	 ect 	 	screen	that	is	about	a	meter	 a 	 cross 	 	.
 Nar 	 rator 	 	:	In	front	of	the	sub	,	a	mess	screen	will	come	 in 	 to 	 	contact	with	the	 soft 	 - 	 bodied 	 	 creature 	 s 	 	of	the	deep	sea	.
With	the	sub	's	 light 	 s 	 	 s 	 witch 	 ed 	 	off	,	it	is	possible	to	see	 the 	 ir 	 	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nce 	 	--	the	light	 produce 	 d 	 	when	they	collide	with	the	mesh	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	time	it	 ha 	 s 	 	ever	 be 	 en 	 	 record 	 ed 	 	.
 Edi 	 th 	 	 Wi 	 d 	 der 	 	:	So	I	 record 	 ed 	 	that	with	an	 intens 	 ified 	 	video	camera	that	 ha 	 s 	 	about	the	 sensitiv 	 ity 	 	of	the	fully	 dark 	 - 	 adapt 	 ed 	 	human	eye	.
 Whi 	 ch 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	is	what	you	would	see	if	you	took	a	 d 	 ive 	 	in	a	submersible	.
But	just	to	try	to	prove	that	fact	to	you	,	I	've	 br 	 ought 	 	 a 	 long 	 	some	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nt 	 	plankton	in	what	is	 un 	 doubt 	 ed 	 ly 	 	a	 fool 	 hard 	 y 	 	attempt	at	a	live	 demonst 	 ration 	 	.
So	,	if	we	could	have	the	 light 	 s 	 	down	and	have	it	 a 	 s 	 	dark	in	here	 a 	 s 	 	possible	,	I	have	a	flask	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nt 	 	plankton	in	it	.
And	you	'll	note	there	's	no	light	coming	from	them	right	now	,	either	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	dead	--	or	 be 	 cause 	 	I	need	to	stir	them	up	in	some	way	for	you	to	see	what	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nce 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
Oops	.	 So 	 rry 	 	.
I	 s 	 pend 	 	most	of	my	time	 work 	 ing 	 	in	the	dark	;	I	'm	used	to	that	.
 Oka 	 y 	 	.
So	that	light	was	made	by	a	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nt 	 	 dinofla 	 gel 	 late 	 	,	a	 single 	 - 	 cell 	 ed 	 	 al 	 ga 	 	.
So	why	would	a	 single 	 - 	 cell 	 ed 	 	 al 	 ga 	 	need	to	be	able	to	produce	light	?
Well	,	it	uses	it	to	defend	 it 	 self 	 	from	 it 	 s 	 	 predator 	 s 	 	.
The	flash	is	like	a	 s 	 cream 	 	for	help	.
It	's	what	's	known	 a 	 s 	 	a	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nt 	 	burglar	alarm	,	and	just	like	the	alarm	on	your	car	or	your	house	,	it	's	 me 	 ant 	 	to	cast	 un 	 want 	 ed 	 	attention	onto	the	 intrud 	 er 	 	,	 there 	 by 	 	either	 lead 	 ing 	 	to	his	capture	or	 scar 	 ing 	 	him	away	.
There	's	a	lot	of	 animal 	 s 	 	that	use	 th 	 is 	 	trick	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	 th 	 is 	 	black	 dragon 	 fish 	 	.
It	's	got	a	light	organ	under	 it 	 s 	 	eye	.
It	's	got	a	chin	 barb 	 el 	 	.
It	's	got	a	lot	of	other	light	 organ 	 s 	 	you	ca	n't	see	,	but	you	'll	see	in	here	in	a	minute	.
So	we	had	to	chase	 th 	 is 	 	in	the	submersible	for	 quit 	 e 	 	 some 	 time 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	top	speed	of	 th 	 is 	 	fish	is	one	knot	,	which	was	the	top	speed	of	the	submersible	.
But	it	was	worth	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	caught	it	in	a	special	capture	 de 	 vice 	 	,	 br 	 ought 	 	it	up	 in 	 to 	 	the	lab	on	the	ship	,	and	then	 every 	 thing 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	fish	 light 	 s 	 	up	.
It	's	 un 	 believ 	 able 	 	.
The	light	 organ 	 s 	 	under	the	 eye 	 s 	 	are	 flash 	 ing 	 	.
That	chin	 barb 	 el 	 	is	 flash 	 ing 	 	.
It	's	got	light	 organ 	 s 	 	on	 it 	 s 	 	 bel 	 ly 	 	that	are	 flash 	 ing 	 	,	fin	 light 	 s 	 	.
It	's	a	 s 	 cream 	 	for	help	;	it	's	 me 	 ant 	 	to	attract	attention	.
It	's	 phenomen 	 al 	 	.
And	you	 normal 	 ly 	 	do	n't	get	to	see	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	've	 exhaust 	 ed 	 	the	 luminesce 	 nce 	 	when	we	 br 	 ing 	 	them	up	in	 net 	 s 	 	.
There	's	other	ways	you	can	defend	 your 	 self 	 	with	light	.
For	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	shrimp	 re 	 lease 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nt 	 	 chemical 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	water	just	the	way	a	 s 	 quid 	 	or	an	 oct 	 opus 	 	would	 re 	 lease 	 	an	ink	cloud	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 blind 	 s 	 	or	 distract 	 s 	 	the	predator	.
 Th 	 is 	 	little	 s 	 quid 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	fire	 shoot 	 er 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 it 	 s 	 	ability	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	it	may	look	like	a	tasty	morsel	,	or	a	pig	's	head	with	 wing 	 s 	 	--	but	if	it	's	 attack 	 ed 	 	,	it	 put 	 s 	 	out	a	 bar 	 rage 	 	of	light	--	in	fact	,	a	 bar 	 rage 	 	of	 photo 	 n 	 	 torpedo 	 es 	 	.
I	just	 bare 	 ly 	 	got	the	 light 	 s 	 	out	in	time	for	you	to	be	able	to	see	 t 	 hose 	 	 gob 	 s 	 	of	light	hitting	the	 trans 	 ect 	 	screen	and	then	just	 glow 	 ing 	 	.
It	's	 phenomen 	 al 	 	.
So	there	's	a	lot	of	 animal 	 s 	 	in	the	open	ocean	--	most	of	them	that	make	light	.
And	we	have	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	idea	,	for	most	of	them	,	why	.
 The 	 y 	 	use	it	for	 find 	 ing 	 	food	,	for	 attract 	 ing 	 	 mate 	 s 	 	,	for	 defend 	 ing 	 	against	 predator 	 s 	 	.
But	when	you	get	down	to	the	bottom	of	the	ocean	,	that	's	where	 thing 	 s 	 	get	 re 	 ally 	 	strange	.
And	some	of	these	 animal 	 s 	 	are	 prob 	 ably 	 	inspiration	for	the	 thing 	 s 	 	you	saw	in	``	Avatar	,	''	but	you	do	n't	have	to	travel	to	Pandora	to	see	them	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	 gold 	 en 	 	coral	,	a	bush	.
It	 grow 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	.
In	fact	,	it	's	thought	that	some	of	these	are	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	3,000	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	which	is	one	reason	that	bottom	 trawl 	 ing 	 	should	not	be	 allow 	 ed 	 	.
The	other	reason	is	 th 	 is 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	bush	 glow 	 s 	 	.
So	if	you	brush	up	against	it	,	any	place	you	 brush 	 ed 	 	against	it	,	you	get	 th 	 is 	 	 twinkl 	 ing 	 	 blue 	 - 	 green 	 	light	that	's	just	 breath 	 taking 	 	.
And	you	see	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	 some 	 thing 	 	out	of	a	 Dr 	 . 	 	Seuss	book	--	just	all	manner	of	 creature 	 s 	 	all	over	 th 	 is 	 	thing	.
And	these	are	 fly 	 trap 	 	 ane 	 mon 	 es 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	if	you	poke	it	,	it	 pull 	 s 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	 tent 	 acle 	 s 	 	.
But	if	you	keep	 po 	 king 	 	it	,	it	 start 	 s 	 	to	produce	light	.
And	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 end 	 s 	 	up	looking	like	a	 galax 	 y 	 	.
It	 produce 	 s 	 	these	 string 	 s 	 	of	light	,	 pre 	 sum 	 ably 	 	 a 	 s 	 	some	form	of	defense	.
There	are	 star 	 fish 	 	that	can	make	light	.
And	there	are	brittle	 star 	 s 	 	that	produce	 band 	 s 	 	of	light	that	dance	 a 	 long 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 arm 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	plant	,	but	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	an	animal	.
And	it	 anchor 	 s 	 	 it 	 self 	 	in	the	sand	by	 blow 	 ing 	 	up	a	balloon	on	the	end	of	 it 	 s 	 	stock	.
So	it	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	hold	 it 	 self 	 	in	 ver 	 y 	 	strong	 current 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	see	here	.
But	if	we	collect	it	 ver 	 y 	 	 gent 	 ly 	 	,	and	we	 br 	 ing 	 	it	up	 in 	 to 	 	the	lab	and	just	 squeez 	 e 	 	it	at	the	base	of	the	stock	,	it	 produce 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	light	that	 propag 	 ates 	 	from	stem	to	the	plume	,	changing	color	 a 	 s 	 	it	 go 	 es 	 	,	from	green	to	blue	.
 Color 	 ization 	 	and	sound	 effect 	 s 	 	 add 	 ed 	 	for	you	 view 	 ing 	 	pleasure	.
But	we	have	no	idea	why	it	 do 	 es 	 	that	.
 He 	 re 	 	's	 an 	 other 	 	one	.	 Th 	 is 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	a	sea	pen	.
It	's	got	a	brittle	star	 hitch 	 ing 	 	a	ride	.
It	's	a	green	 s 	 ab 	 er 	 	of	light	.
And	like	the	one	you	just	saw	,	it	can	produce	these	 a 	 s 	 	 band 	 s 	 	of	light	.
So	if	I	 squeez 	 e 	 	the	base	,	the	 band 	 s 	 	go	from	base	to	tip	.
If	I	 squeez 	 e 	 	the	tip	,	they	go	from	tip	to	base	.
So	what	do	you	think	 happen 	 s 	 	if	you	 squeez 	 e 	 	it	in	the	middle	?
I	'd	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	your	 the 	 ories 	 	about	what	that	's	about	.
So	there	's	a	language	of	light	in	the	deep	ocean	,	and	we	're	just	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	understand	it	,	and	one	way	we	're	going	about	that	is	we	're	 imit 	 ating 	 	a	lot	of	these	 dis 	 play 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	an	optical	lure	that	I	've	used	.
We	call	it	the	 electron 	 ic 	 	 jelly 	 fish 	 	.
It	's	just	16	blue	 LED 	 s 	 	that	we	can	program	to	do	different	 type 	 s 	 	of	 dis 	 play 	 s 	 	.
And	we	view	it	with	a	camera	system	I	 develop 	 ed 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 Eye 	 - 	 in 	 - 	 the 	 - 	 Sea 	 	that	uses	far	red	light	that	's	 in 	 visible 	 	to	most	 animal 	 s 	 	,	so	it	's	 un 	 obt 	 rus 	 ive 	 	.
So	I	just	want	to	show	you	some	of	the	 respons 	 es 	 	we	've	 elicit 	 ed 	 	from	 animal 	 s 	 	in	the	deep	sea	.
So	the	camera	's	black	and	white	.
It	's	not	 high 	 - 	 re 	 solution 	 	.
And	what	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	here	is	a	bait	box	with	a	bunch	of	--	like	the	 cock 	 roach 	 es 	 	of	the	ocean	--	there	are	 iso 	 pods 	 	all	over	it	.
And	right	in	the	front	is	the	 electron 	 ic 	 	 jelly 	 fish 	 	.
And	when	it	 start 	 s 	 	 flash 	 ing 	 	,	it	's	just	going	to	be	one	of	the	 LED 	 s 	 	that	's	 flash 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	fast	.
But	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	it	 start 	 s 	 	to	flash	--	and	it	's	going	to	look	big	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 bloom 	 s 	 	on	the	camera	--	I	want	you	to	look	right	here	.
There	's	 some 	 thing 	 	small	there	that	 respond 	 s 	 	.
We	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	 some 	 thing 	 	.
It	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	little	of	string	 pearl 	 s 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	--	in	fact	,	three	 string 	 s 	 	of	 pearl 	 s 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 consist 	 ent 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	was	in	the	Bahamas	at	about	2,000	feet	.
We	 bas 	 ically 	 	have	a	chat	room	going	on	here	,	 be 	 cause 	 	once	it	 get 	 s 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	,	 every 	 body 	 	's	 talk 	 ing 	 	.
And	I	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	shrimp	that	's	 re 	 leas 	 ing 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nt 	 	 chemical 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	water	.
But	the	cool	thing	is	,	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	it	.
We	do	n't	know	what	we	're	 say 	 ing 	 	.
 Personal 	 ly 	 	,	I	think	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	sexy	.
And	then	 final 	 ly 	 	,	I	want	to	show	you	some	 respons 	 es 	 	that	we	 record 	 ed 	 	with	the	world	's	first	 deep 	 - 	 sea 	 	 web 	 cam 	 	,	which	we	had	 install 	 ed 	 	in	 Monte 	 re 	 y 	 	Canyon	last	year	.
We	've	 on 	 ly 	 	just	 beg 	 un 	 	to	 analyz 	 e 	 	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	data	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	be	a	 glow 	 ing 	 	source	first	,	which	is	like	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nt 	 	bacteria	.
And	it	is	an	optical	cue	that	there	's	 car 	 r 	 ion 	 	on	the	bottom	of	the	ocean	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	 scavenge 	 r 	 	 come 	 s 	 	in	,	which	is	a	giant	 six 	 gill 	 	 s 	 hark 	 	.
And	I	ca	n't	claim	for	 s 	 ure 	 	that	the	optical	source	 br 	 ought 	 	it	in	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	bait	right	there	.
But	if	it	had	 be 	 en 	 	 follow 	 ing 	 	the	odor	plume	,	it	would	have	come	in	from	the	other	direction	.
And	it	 do 	 es 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	seem	to	be	 try 	 ing 	 	to	eat	the	 electron 	 ic 	 	 jelly 	 fish 	 	.
That	's	a	12-foot-long	giant	 six 	 gill 	 	 s 	 hark 	 	.
 Oka 	 y 	 	,	so	 th 	 is 	 	next	one	is	from	the	 web 	 cam 	 	,	and	it	's	going	to	be	 th 	 is 	 	 pin 	 wheel 	 	 dis 	 play 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	burglar	alarm	.
And	that	was	a	 Hum 	 bold 	 t 	 	 s 	 quid 	 	,	a	juvenile	 Hum 	 bold 	 t 	 	 s 	 quid 	 	,	about	three	feet	long	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	at	3,000	feet	in	 Monte 	 re 	 y 	 	Canyon	.
But	if	it	's	a	burglar	alarm	,	you	would	n't	expect	it	to	attack	the	 jelly 	 fish 	 	 direct 	 ly 	 	.
It	's	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	 attack 	 ing 	 	what	's	 attack 	 ing 	 	the	 jelly 	 fish 	 	.
But	we	did	see	a	bunch	of	 respons 	 es 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	guy	is	a	little	more	 contempl 	 ative 	 	.
``	Hey	,	wait	a	minute	.
There	's	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	 some 	 thing 	 	else	there	.	''
He	's	 think 	 ing 	 	about	it	.
But	he	's	 persist 	 ent 	 	.
He	 keep 	 s 	 	coming	back	.
And	then	he	 go 	 es 	 	away	for	a	few	 second 	 s 	 	to	think	about	it	some	more	,	and	 think 	 s 	 	,	``	 May 	 be 	 	if	I	come	in	from	a	different	angle	.	''
 No 	 pe 	 	.
So	we	are	 start 	 ing 	 	to	get	a	handle	on	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	 on 	 ly 	 	just	the	 begin 	 ning 	 s 	 	.
We	need	more	 eye 	 s 	 	on	the	process	.
So	if	any	of	you	ever	get	a	chance	to	take	a	 d 	 ive 	 	in	a	submersible	,	by	all	 mean 	 s 	 	,	climb	in	and	take	the	plunge	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	should	be	on	 every 	 body 	 	's	 buck 	 et 	 	list	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	live	on	an	ocean	planet	.
 Mo 	 re 	 	than	90	percent	,	99	percent	,	of	the	living	space	on	our	planet	is	ocean	.
It	's	a	 magic 	 al 	 	place	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	 breath 	 taking 	 	light	 show 	 s 	 	and	bizarre	and	 won 	 dr 	 ous 	 	 creature 	 s 	 	,	alien	life	 form 	 s 	 	that	you	do	n't	have	to	travel	to	 an 	 other 	 	planet	to	see	.
But	if	you	do	take	the	plunge	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	remember	to	turn	out	the	 light 	 s 	 	.
But	I	 war 	 n 	 	you	,	it	's	 addict 	 ive 	 	.
Thank	you	.
What	I	'm	going	to	show	you	are	the	 astonish 	 ing 	 	 mole 	 cular 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	that	create	the	living	fabric	of	your	body	.
 N 	 ow 	 	 molecule 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 tin 	 y 	 	.
And	by	 tin 	 y 	 	,	I	mean	 re 	 ally 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	 small 	 er 	 	than	a	 wave 	 length 	 	of	light	,	so	we	have	no	way	to	 direct 	 ly 	 	 observ 	 e 	 	them	.
But	through	science	,	we	do	have	a	 fair 	 ly 	 	good	idea	of	what	's	going	on	down	at	the	 mole 	 cular 	 	scale	.
So	what	we	can	do	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	tell	you	about	the	 molecule 	 s 	 	,	but	we	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	have	a	direct	way	of	 show 	 ing 	 	you	the	 molecule 	 s 	 	.
One	way	around	 th 	 is 	 	is	to	draw	 picture 	 s 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	idea	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	new	.
 Scient 	 ists 	 	have	 al 	 ways 	 	 create 	 d 	 	 picture 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	part	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	and	 discover 	 y 	 	process	.
 The 	 y 	 	draw	 picture 	 s 	 	of	what	they	're	 observ 	 ing 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	,	through	technology	like	 tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	and	 micro 	 scope 	 s 	 	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	what	they	're	 think 	 ing 	 	about	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 mind 	 s 	 	.
I	 pick 	 ed 	 	two	 well 	 - 	 known 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 well 	 - 	 known 	 	for	 express 	 ing 	 	science	through	art	.
And	I	start	with	 Gal 	 ile 	 o 	 	who	used	the	world	's	first	 tele 	 scope 	 	to	look	at	the	 Mo 	 on 	 	.
And	he	 transform 	 ed 	 	our	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	the	 Mo 	 on 	 	.
The	 per 	 ception 	 	in	the	17th	century	was	the	 Mo 	 on 	 	was	a	perfect	 heaven 	 ly 	 	sphere	.
But	what	 Gal 	 ile 	 o 	 	saw	was	a	 rock 	 y 	 	,	 bar 	 ren 	 	world	,	which	he	 express 	 ed 	 	through	his	 water 	 color 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 	.
 An 	 other 	 	scientist	with	 ver 	 y 	 	big	 idea 	 s 	 	,	the	 super 	 star 	 	of	biology	,	is	 Char 	 les 	 	Darwin	.
And	with	 th 	 is 	 	famous	entry	in	his	 note 	 book 	 	,	he	 begin 	 s 	 	in	the	top	 left 	 - 	 hand 	 	corner	with	,	``	I	think	,	''	and	then	 sketch 	 es 	 	out	the	first	tree	of	life	,	which	is	his	 per 	 ception 	 	of	how	all	the	species	,	all	living	 thing 	 s 	 	on	Earth	,	are	 connect 	 ed 	 	through	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	--	the	origin	of	species	through	natural	 s 	 election 	 	and	 diverge 	 nce 	 	from	an	 ance 	 stral 	 	population	.
Even	 a 	 s 	 	a	scientist	,	I	used	to	go	to	 lectur 	 es 	 	by	 mole 	 cular 	 	 biologist 	 s 	 	and	find	them	 complete 	 ly 	 	 in 	 comprehens 	 ible 	 	,	with	all	the	 f 	 ancy 	 	technical	language	and	 jar 	 gon 	 	that	they	would	use	in	 de 	 s 	 crib 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	work	,	 un 	 til 	 	I	 en 	 counter 	 ed 	 	the	 art 	 work 	 s 	 	of	 D 	 avid 	 	Goodsell	,	who	is	a	 mole 	 cular 	 	biologist	at	the	Scripps	Institute	.
And	his	 picture 	 s 	 	,	 every 	 thing 	 	's	accurate	and	it	's	all	to	scale	.
And	his	work	 illuminate 	 d 	 	for	me	what	the	 mole 	 cular 	 	world	 in 	 side 	 	us	is	like	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	transection	through	blood	.
In	the	top	 left 	 - 	 hand 	 	corner	,	you	've	got	 th 	 is 	 	 yellow 	 - 	 green 	 	area	.
The	 yellow 	 - 	 green 	 	area	is	the	 fluid 	 s 	 	of	blood	,	which	is	 most 	 ly 	 	water	,	but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 anti 	 bodies 	 	,	 sugar 	 s 	 	,	 hormone 	 s 	 	,	that	kind	of	thing	.
And	the	red	region	is	a	slice	 in 	 to 	 	a	red	blood	cell	.
And	 t 	 hose 	 	red	 molecule 	 s 	 	are	hemoglobin	.
 The 	 y 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	red	;	that	's	what	 give 	 s 	 	blood	 it 	 s 	 	color	.
And	hemoglobin	 act 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 mole 	 cular 	 	sponge	to	soak	up	the	oxygen	in	your	 lung 	 s 	 	and	then	carry	it	to	other	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	body	.
I	was	 ver 	 y 	 	much	inspired	by	 th 	 is 	 	image	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	I	 wonder 	 ed 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	we	could	use	computer	 graphic 	 s 	 	to	represent	the	 mole 	 cular 	 	world	.
What	would	it	look	like	?
And	that	's	how	I	 re 	 ally 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	.	So	let	's	begin	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	DNA	in	 it 	 s 	 	classic	double	 hel 	 ix 	 	form	.
And	it	's	from	 X 	 - 	 ray 	 	 crystall 	 ography 	 	,	so	it	's	an	accurate	model	of	DNA	.
If	we	 un 	 wind 	 	the	double	 hel 	 ix 	 	and	unzip	the	two	 strand 	 s 	 	,	you	see	these	 thing 	 s 	 	that	look	like	 tee 	 th 	 	.
 T 	 hose 	 	are	the	 letter 	 s 	 	of	genetic	code	,	the	25,000	 gene 	 s 	 	you	've	got	written	in	your	DNA	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	what	they	 typical 	 ly 	 	talk	about	--	the	genetic	code	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	they	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	.
But	I	want	to	talk	about	a	different	 a 	 spect 	 	of	DNA	science	,	and	that	is	the	physical	nature	of	DNA	.
It	's	these	two	 strand 	 s 	 	that	run	in	 oppos 	 ite 	 	 direction 	 s 	 	for	 reason 	 s 	 	I	ca	n't	go	 in 	 to 	 	right	now	.
But	they	 physical 	 ly 	 	run	in	 oppos 	 ite 	 	 direction 	 s 	 	,	which	 create 	 s 	 	a	number	of	 complic 	 ations 	 	for	your	living	 cell 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	're	about	to	see	,	most	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	when	DNA	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 cop 	 ied 	 	.
And	so	what	I	'm	about	to	show	you	is	an	accurate	 represent 	 ation 	 	of	the	actual	DNA	 replica 	 tion 	 	machine	that	's	 occur 	 ring 	 	right	now	 in 	 side 	 	your	body	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	2002	biology	.
So	DNA	's	 enter 	 ing 	 	the	production	line	from	the	 left 	 - 	 hand 	 	side	,	and	it	 hit 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 collect 	 ion 	 	,	these	 miniatur 	 e 	 	 bio 	 chemical 	 	 machine 	 s 	 	,	that	are	 pull 	 ing 	 	 a 	 part 	 	the	DNA	strand	and	making	an	exact	copy	.
So	DNA	 come 	 s 	 	in	and	 hit 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	blue	,	doughnut-shaped	structure	and	it	's	 rip 	 ped 	 	 a 	 part 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 it 	 s 	 	two	 strand 	 s 	 	.
One	strand	can	be	 cop 	 ied 	 	 direct 	 ly 	 	,	and	you	can	see	these	 thing 	 s 	 	spooling	off	to	the	bottom	there	.
But	 thing 	 s 	 	are	n't	so	simple	for	the	other	strand	 be 	 cause 	 	it	must	be	 cop 	 ied 	 	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	.
So	it	's	 throw 	 n 	 	out	 repeat 	 ed 	 ly 	 	in	these	 loop 	 s 	 	and	 cop 	 ied 	 	one	section	at	a	time	,	creating	two	new	DNA	 molecule 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	you	have	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	machine	right	now	 work 	 ing 	 	away	 in 	 side 	 	you	,	 copy 	 ing 	 	your	DNA	with	exquisite	fidelity	.
It	's	an	accurate	 represent 	 ation 	 	,	and	it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	at	the	correct	speed	for	what	is	 occur 	 ring 	 	 in 	 side 	 	you	.
I	've	left	out	error	 correct 	 ion 	 	and	a	bunch	of	other	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	was	work	from	a	number	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
Thank	you	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	work	from	a	number	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	but	what	I	'll	show	you	next	is	 update 	 d 	 	science	,	it	's	 update 	 d 	 	technology	.
So	 aga 	 in 	 	,	we	begin	with	DNA	.
And	it	's	jiggling	and	 wig 	 gling 	 	there	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 surround 	 ing 	 	soup	of	 molecule 	 s 	 	,	which	I	've	 strip 	 ped 	 	away	so	you	can	see	 some 	 thing 	 	.
DNA	is	about	two	 nano 	 meter 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	,	which	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 tin 	 y 	 	.
But	in	each	one	of	your	 cell 	 s 	 	,	each	strand	of	DNA	is	about	30	to	40	million	 nano 	 meter 	 s 	 	long	.
So	to	keep	the	DNA	 organize 	 d 	 	and	 regulat 	 e 	 	access	to	the	genetic	code	,	it	's	 wrap 	 ped 	 	around	these	 pur 	 ple 	 	 protein 	 s 	 	--	or	I	've	 label 	 ed 	 	them	 pur 	 ple 	 	here	.
It	's	 package 	 d 	 	up	and	bundled	up	.
All	 th 	 is 	 	field	of	view	is	a	single	strand	of	DNA	.
 Th 	 is 	 	huge	package	of	DNA	is	 call 	 ed 	 	a	 chromosom 	 e 	 	.
And	we	'll	come	back	to	 chromosom 	 es 	 	in	a	minute	.
We	're	 pull 	 ing 	 	out	,	we	're	 zoom 	 ing 	 	out	,	out	through	a	nuclear	pore	,	which	is	the	 gate 	 way 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	compartment	that	 hold 	 s 	 	all	the	DNA	 call 	 ed 	 	the	nucleus	.
All	of	 th 	 is 	 	field	of	view	is	about	a	semester	's	worth	of	biology	,	and	I	've	got	seven	 minute 	 s 	 	.
So	we	're	not	going	to	be	able	to	do	that	 to 	 day 	 	?
No	,	I	'm	 be 	 ing 	 	told	,	``	No	.	''
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	way	a	living	cell	 look 	 s 	 	down	a	light	 micro 	 scope 	 	.
And	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 film 	 ed 	 	under	 time 	 - 	 lapse 	 	,	which	is	why	you	can	see	it	moving	.
The	nuclear	 envelop 	 e 	 	 break 	 s 	 	down	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	sausage-shaped	 thing 	 s 	 	are	the	 chromosom 	 es 	 	,	and	we	'll	focus	on	them	.
 The 	 y 	 	go	through	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 tri 	 king 	 	motion	that	is	focused	on	these	little	red	 spot 	 s 	 	.
When	the	cell	 feel 	 s 	 	it	's	ready	to	go	,	it	 rip 	 s 	 	 a 	 part 	 	the	 chromosom 	 e 	 	.
One	set	of	DNA	 go 	 es 	 	to	one	side	,	the	other	side	 get 	 s 	 	the	other	set	of	DNA	--	 ident 	 ical 	 	copies	of	DNA	.
And	then	the	cell	 split 	 s 	 	down	the	middle	.
And	 aga 	 in 	 	,	you	have	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 cell 	 s 	 	 under 	 going 	 	 th 	 is 	 	process	right	now	 in 	 side 	 	of	you	.
 N 	 ow 	 	we	're	going	to	rewind	and	just	focus	on	the	 chromosom 	 es 	 	and	look	at	 it 	 s 	 	structure	and	 de 	 scribe 	 	it	.
So	 aga 	 in 	 	,	here	we	are	at	that	 equ 	 ator 	 	moment	.
The	 chromosom 	 es 	 	line	up	.
And	if	we	isolate	just	one	 chromosom 	 e 	 	,	we	're	going	to	pull	it	out	and	have	a	look	at	 it 	 s 	 	structure	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 mole 	 cular 	 	 structure 	 s 	 	that	you	have	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	we	've	 discover 	 ed 	 	so	far	 in 	 side 	 	of	us	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	single	 chromosom 	 e 	 	.
And	you	have	two	 strand 	 s 	 	of	DNA	in	each	 chromosom 	 e 	 	.
One	is	bundled	up	 in 	 to 	 	one	sausage	.
The	other	strand	is	bundled	up	 in 	 to 	 	the	other	sausage	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	look	like	 whisk 	 ers 	 	that	are	 stick 	 ing 	 	out	from	either	side	are	the	dynamic	 scaffold 	 ing 	 	of	the	cell	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	 call 	 ed 	 	mircrotubules	.	That	name	's	not	 import 	 ant 	 	.
But	what	we	're	going	to	focus	on	is	 th 	 is 	 	red	region	--	I	've	 label 	 ed 	 	it	red	here	--	and	it	's	the	 inter 	 face 	 	between	the	dynamic	 scaffold 	 ing 	 	and	the	 chromosom 	 es 	 	.
It	is	 obvious 	 ly 	 	central	to	the	 move 	 ment 	 	of	the	 chromosom 	 es 	 	.
We	have	no	idea	 re 	 ally 	 	 a 	 s 	 	to	how	it	's	 achiev 	 ing 	 	that	 move 	 ment 	 	.
We	've	 be 	 en 	 	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	thing	they	call	the	kinetochore	for	over	a	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	with	 intens 	 e 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	,	and	we	're	still	just	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	discover	what	it	's	all	about	.
It	is	made	up	of	about	200	different	 type 	 s 	 	of	 protein 	 s 	 	,	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 protein 	 s 	 	in	total	.
It	is	a	signal	 broad 	 cast 	 ing 	 	system	.
It	broadcasts	through	chemical	 signal 	 s 	 	 tell 	 ing 	 	the	rest	of	the	cell	when	it	's	ready	,	when	it	 feel 	 s 	 	that	 every 	 thing 	 	is	 align 	 ed 	 	and	ready	to	go	for	the	 separat 	 ion 	 	of	the	 chromosom 	 es 	 	.
It	is	able	to	couple	onto	the	growing	and	 shrink 	 ing 	 	microtubules	.
It	's	 involve 	 d 	 	with	the	growing	of	the	microtubules	,	and	it	's	able	to	transiently	couple	onto	them	.
It	's	 al 	 so 	 	an	attention	 sens 	 ing 	 	system	.
It	's	able	to	feel	when	the	cell	is	ready	,	when	the	 chromosom 	 e 	 	is	 correct 	 ly 	 	 position 	 ed 	 	.
It	's	 turn 	 ing 	 	green	here	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 feel 	 s 	 	that	 every 	 thing 	 	is	just	right	.
And	you	'll	see	,	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	one	little	last	bit	that	's	still	 remain 	 ing 	 	red	.
And	it	's	 walk 	 ed 	 	away	down	the	microtubules	.
That	is	the	signal	 broad 	 cast 	 ing 	 	system	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	out	the	stop	signal	.
And	it	's	 walk 	 ed 	 	away	.	I	mean	,	it	's	that	 mechanic 	 al 	 	.
It	's	 mole 	 cular 	 	 clock 	 work 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	how	you	work	at	the	 mole 	 cular 	 	scale	.
So	with	a	little	bit	of	 mole 	 cular 	 	eye	 can 	 dy 	 	,	we	've	got	 kine 	 s 	 in 	 s 	 	,	which	are	the	 o 	 range 	 	 one 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	little	 mole 	 cular 	 	 cou 	 rier 	 	 molecule 	 s 	 	 walk 	 ing 	 	one	way	.
And	here	are	the	dynein	.	 The 	 y 	 	're	 carry 	 ing 	 	that	 broad 	 cast 	 ing 	 	system	.
And	they	've	got	 the 	 ir 	 	long	 leg 	 s 	 	so	they	can	step	around	 obstacle 	 s 	 	and	so	on	.
So	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	all	derived	 accurate 	 ly 	 	from	the	science	.
The	problem	is	we	ca	n't	show	it	to	you	any	other	way	.
 Explo 	 ring 	 	at	the	 front 	 ier 	 	of	science	,	at	the	 front 	 ier 	 	of	human	 understand 	 ing 	 	,	is	 mind 	 - 	 blow 	 ing 	 	.
 Discover 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	is	 certain 	 ly 	 	a	 pleas 	 ur 	 able 	 	incentive	to	work	in	science	.
But	most	medical	 research 	 ers 	 	--	 discover 	 ing 	 	the	stuff	is	 simpl 	 y 	 	 step 	 s 	 	 a 	 long 	 	the	path	to	the	big	 goal 	 s 	 	,	which	are	to	 eradic 	 ate 	 	disease	,	to	eliminate	the	 suffer 	 ing 	 	and	the	 mis 	 ery 	 	that	disease	 cause 	 s 	 	and	to	lift	people	out	of	poverty	.
Thank	you	.
I	'm	here	to	enlist	you	in	 help 	 ing 	 	 re 	 shape 	 	the	story	about	how	 human 	 s 	 	and	other	 critter 	 s 	 	get	 thing 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	.
 He 	 re 	 	is	the	old	story	--	we	've	 al 	 ready 	 	heard	a	little	bit	about	it	:	biology	is	war	in	which	 on 	 ly 	 	the	 fierce 	 st 	 	 surviv 	 e 	 	;	 business 	 es 	 	and	 nation 	 s 	 	succeed	 on 	 ly 	 	by	 defeat 	 ing 	 	,	 destroy 	 ing 	 	and	 domin 	 ating 	 	 com 	 petition 	 	;	 politic 	 s 	 	is	about	your	side	winning	at	all	 cost 	 s 	 	.
But	I	think	we	can	see	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 begin 	 ning 	 s 	 	of	a	new	story	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	emerge	.
It	's	a	narrative	spread	 a 	 cross 	 	a	number	of	different	 discipline 	 s 	 	,	in	which	 co 	 operation 	 	,	 collect 	 ive 	 	action	and	complex	 inter 	 depend 	 encies 	 	play	a	more	 import 	 ant 	 	role	.
And	the	central	,	but	not	 all 	 - 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	role	of	 com 	 petition 	 	and	 surviv 	 al 	 	of	the	 fit 	 test 	 	 shrink 	 s 	 	just	a	little	bit	to	make	room	.
I	 start 	 ed 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	the	relationship	between	communication	,	media	and	 collect 	 ive 	 	action	when	I	wrote	``	Smart	 Mo 	 b 	 s 	 	,	''	and	I	found	that	when	I	 finish 	 ed 	 	the	book	,	I	 ke 	 pt 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	it	.
In	fact	,	if	you	look	back	,	human	communication	media	and	the	ways	in	which	we	organize	 social 	 ly 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 co 	 - 	 evolv 	 ing 	 	for	 quit 	 e 	 	a	long	time	.
 Human 	 s 	 	have	lived	for	much	,	much	 long 	 er 	 	than	the	 approximate 	 ly 	 	10,000	 year 	 s 	 	of	 settl 	 ed 	 	 agricultur 	 al 	 	 civil 	 ization 	 	in	small	family	 group 	 s 	 	.	 No 	 mad 	 ic 	 	 hunter 	 s 	 	 br 	 ing 	 	down	 rabbi 	 ts 	 	,	 gather 	 ing 	 	food	.
The	form	of	wealth	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 day 	 s 	 	was	 en 	 ough 	 	food	to	stay	 al 	 ive 	 	.
But	at	some	point	,	they	 band 	 ed 	 	together	to	hunt	 big 	 ger 	 	game	.
And	we	do	n't	know	 exact 	 ly 	 	how	they	did	 th 	 is 	 	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	they	must	have	 solve 	 d 	 	some	 collect 	 ive 	 	action	 problem 	 s 	 	;	it	 on 	 ly 	 	 make 	 s 	 	sense	that	you	ca	n't	hunt	 mast 	 odon 	 s 	 	while	you	're	 fight 	 ing 	 	with	the	other	 group 	 s 	 	.
And	 aga 	 in 	 	,	we	have	no	way	of	 know 	 ing 	 	,	but	it	's	clear	that	a	new	form	of	wealth	must	have	 emerge 	 d 	 	.
 Mo 	 re 	 	protein	than	a	hunter	's	family	could	eat	before	it	 rot 	 ted 	 	.
So	that	raised	a	social	question	that	I	 believ 	 e 	 	must	have	driven	new	social	 form 	 s 	 	.
Did	the	people	who	ate	that	 mast 	 odon 	 	meat	owe	 some 	 thing 	 	to	the	 hunter 	 s 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	?
And	if	so	,	how	did	they	make	 arrange 	 ments 	 	?
 Aga 	 in 	 	,	we	ca	n't	know	,	but	we	can	be	 pre 	 tty 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	that	some	form	of	 symbol 	 ic 	 	communication	must	have	 be 	 en 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	.
Of	course	,	with	 agricultur 	 e 	 	came	the	first	big	 civil 	 ization 	 s 	 	,	the	first	cities	built	of	mud	and	brick	,	the	first	 empire 	 s 	 	.
And	it	was	the	 administer 	 s 	 	of	these	 empire 	 s 	 	who	 beg 	 an 	 	 hir 	 ing 	 	people	to	keep	track	of	the	wheat	and	sheep	and	wine	that	was	 ow 	 ed 	 	and	the	 tax 	 es 	 	that	was	 ow 	 ed 	 	on	them	by	making	 mark 	 s 	 	;	 mark 	 s 	 	on	clay	in	that	time	.
Not	too	much	 long 	 er 	 	after	that	,	the	 alpha 	 bet 	 	was	 invent 	 ed 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	tool	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 re 	 serv 	 ed 	 	,	for	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	for	the	elite	 administr 	 ators 	 	who	 ke 	 pt 	 	track	of	 account 	 s 	 	for	the	 empire 	 s 	 	.
And	then	 an 	 other 	 	communication	technology	enabled	new	media	:	the	 print 	 ing 	 	press	came	 a 	 long 	 	,	and	 with 	 in 	 	 decade 	 s 	 	,	 million 	 s 	 	of	people	 be 	 came 	 	 liter 	 ate 	 	.
And	from	 liter 	 ate 	 	 population 	 s 	 	,	new	 form 	 s 	 	of	 collect 	 ive 	 	action	 emerge 	 d 	 	in	the	 sphere 	 s 	 	of	knowledge	,	 relig 	 ion 	 	and	 politic 	 s 	 	.
We	saw	scientific	 revolution 	 s 	 	,	the	 Protest 	 ant 	 	 Re 	 form 	 ation 	 	,	 constit 	 ution 	 al 	 	 demo 	 cracies 	 	possible	where	they	had	not	 be 	 en 	 	possible	before	.
Not	 create 	 d 	 	by	the	 print 	 ing 	 	press	,	but	enabled	by	the	 collect 	 ive 	 	action	that	 emerge 	 s 	 	from	 liter 	 acy 	 	.
And	 aga 	 in 	 	,	new	 form 	 s 	 	of	wealth	 emerge 	 d 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	commerce	is	ancient	.	 Market 	 s 	 	are	 a 	 s 	 	old	 a 	 s 	 	the	 cross 	 road 	 s 	 	.
But	 capital 	 ism 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	know	it	,	is	 on 	 ly 	 	a	few	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	enabled	by	 co 	 operative 	 	 arrange 	 ments 	 	and	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 joint 	 - 	 stock 	 	 owner 	 ship 	 	company	,	 share 	 d 	 	 li 	 ability 	 	 insur 	 ance 	 	,	 double 	 - 	 entry 	 	 book 	 keep 	 ing 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	of	course	,	the	 enabl 	 ing 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	are	based	on	the	Internet	,	and	in	the	 man 	 y 	 - 	 to 	 - 	 man 	 y 	 	era	,	every	 desk 	 top 	 	is	now	a	 print 	 ing 	 	press	,	a	 broad 	 cast 	 ing 	 	station	,	a	community	or	a	 market 	 place 	 	.
Evolution	is	 speed 	 ing 	 	up	.
 Mo 	 re 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	that	power	is	 un 	 tether 	 ing 	 	and	 leap 	 ing 	 	off	the	 desk 	 top 	 s 	 	,	and	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	we	're	going	to	see	a	significant	proportion	,	if	not	the	 major 	 ity 	 	of	the	human	race	,	 walk 	 ing 	 	around	 hold 	 ing 	 	,	 carry 	 ing 	 	or	 wear 	 ing 	 	 super 	 computer 	 s 	 	linked	at	 speed 	 s 	 	 great 	 er 	 	than	what	we	consider	to	be	 broad 	 band 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	when	I	 start 	 ed 	 	looking	 in 	 to 	 	 collect 	 ive 	 	action	,	the	 consider 	 able 	 	 liter 	 ature 	 	on	it	is	based	on	what	 socio 	 logists 	 	call	``	social	 dilemma 	 s 	 	.	''
And	there	are	a	couple	of	 myth 	 ic 	 	 narrative 	 s 	 	of	social	 dilemma 	 s 	 	.
I	'm	going	to	talk	 brief 	 ly 	 	about	two	of	them	:	the	prisoner	's	dilemma	and	the	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	of	the	 common 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	when	I	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	with	 K 	 e 	 vin 	 	 Kell 	 y 	 	,	he	 assur 	 ed 	 	me	that	 every 	 body 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	audience	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 know 	 s 	 	the	 detail 	 s 	 	of	the	prisoner	's	dilemma	,	so	I	'm	just	going	to	go	over	that	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
If	you	have	more	 question 	 s 	 	about	it	,	ask	 K 	 e 	 vin 	 	 Kell 	 y 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	.
The	prisoner	's	dilemma	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	story	that	's	 over 	 laid 	 	on	a	 mathematic 	 al 	 	 m 	 atrix 	 	that	came	out	of	the	game	 theor 	 y 	 	in	the	early	 year 	 s 	 	of	 think 	 ing 	 	about	nuclear	war	:	two	 player 	 s 	 	who	could	n't	trust	each	other	.
Let	me	just	say	that	every	 un 	 secure 	 d 	 	 trans 	 action 	 	is	a	good	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	a	prisoner	's	dilemma	.
 Per 	 son 	 	with	the	 good 	 s 	 	,	person	with	the	money	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	ca	n't	trust	each	other	,	are	not	going	to	 ex 	 change 	 	.
 N 	 either 	 	one	 want 	 s 	 	to	be	the	first	one	or	they	're	going	to	get	the	 suck 	 er 	 	's	 pay 	 off 	 	,	but	both	lose	,	of	course	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	do	n't	get	what	they	want	.
If	they	could	 on 	 ly 	 	agree	,	if	they	could	 on 	 ly 	 	turn	a	prisoner	's	dilemma	 in 	 to 	 	a	different	 pay 	 off 	 	 m 	 atrix 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	an	assurance	game	,	they	could	proceed	.
Twenty	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 Ro 	 bert 	 	 Ax 	 el 	 rod 	 	used	the	prisoner	's	dilemma	 a 	 s 	 	a	 prob 	 e 	 	of	the	 bio 	 logical 	 	question	:	if	we	are	here	 be 	 cause 	 	our	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	fierce	 competitor 	 s 	 	,	how	 do 	 es 	 	 co 	 operation 	 	exist	at	all	?
He	 start 	 ed 	 	a	computer	tournament	for	people	to	submit	prisoner	's	dilemma	 strat 	 egi 	 es 	 	and	 discover 	 ed 	 	,	much	to	his	surprise	,	that	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	won	--	it	won	the	first	tournament	,	and	even	after	 every 	 one 	 	 k 	 new 	 	it	won	,	it	won	the	second	tournament	--	that	's	known	 a 	 s 	 	tit	for	tat	.
 An 	 other 	 	economic	game	that	may	not	be	 a 	 s 	 	well	known	 a 	 s 	 	the	prisoner	's	dilemma	is	the	ultimatum	game	,	and	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 prob 	 e 	 	of	our	 assumption 	 s 	 	about	the	way	people	make	economic	 trans 	 action 	 s 	 	.
 He 	 re 	 	's	how	the	game	is	 play 	 ed 	 	:	there	are	two	 player 	 s 	 	;	they	've	never	 play 	 ed 	 	the	game	before	,	they	will	not	play	the	game	 aga 	 in 	 	,	they	do	n't	know	each	other	,	and	they	are	,	in	fact	,	in	 separat 	 e 	 	rooms	.
First	player	is	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	a	hundred	 dollar 	 s 	 	and	is	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	 pro 	 pose 	 	a	split	:	50/50	,	90/10	,	 what 	 ever 	 	that	player	 want 	 s 	 	to	 pro 	 pose 	 	.	The	second	player	either	 accept 	 s 	 	the	split	--	both	 player 	 s 	 	are	paid	and	the	game	is	over	--	or	 reject 	 s 	 	the	split	--	 n 	 either 	 	player	is	paid	and	the	game	is	over	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	the	fundamental	 bas 	 is 	 	of	 neo 	 classic 	 al 	 	 economic 	 s 	 	would	tell	you	it	's	irrational	to	reject	a	dollar	 be 	 cause 	 	 some 	 one 	 	you	do	n't	know	in	 an 	 other 	 	room	is	going	to	get	99	.
 Y 	 et 	 	in	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 trial 	 s 	 	with	American	and	European	and	 Japan 	 ese 	 	 student 	 s 	 	,	a	significant	 percent 	 age 	 	would	reject	any	 off 	 er 	 	that	's	not	close	to	50/50	.
And	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 screen 	 ed 	 	and	did	n't	know	about	the	game	and	had	never	 play 	 ed 	 	the	game	before	,	 prop 	 os 	 ers 	 	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	 innate 	 ly 	 	know	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	average	proposal	was	 surprising 	 ly 	 	close	to	50/50	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	the	 interest 	 ing 	 	part	 come 	 s 	 	in	more	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	when	 anthropo 	 logists 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	taking	 th 	 is 	 	game	to	other	 culture 	 s 	 	and	 discover 	 ed 	 	,	to	 the 	 ir 	 	surprise	,	that	 s 	 lash 	 - 	 and 	 - 	 burn 	 	 agricultur 	 alist 	 s 	 	in	the	Amazon	or	 nomad 	 ic 	 	 pastor 	 alist 	 s 	 	in	 Cent 	 ral 	 	Asia	or	a	dozen	different	 culture 	 s 	 	--	each	had	 radical 	 ly 	 	different	 idea 	 s 	 	of	what	is	fair	.
 Whi 	 ch 	 	 suggest 	 s 	 	that	 in 	 stead 	 	of	there	 be 	 ing 	 	an	innate	sense	of	 fair 	 ness 	 	,	that	 some 	 how 	 	the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	our	economic	 trans 	 action 	 s 	 	can	be	 influence 	 d 	 	by	our	social	 institution 	 s 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	we	know	that	or	not	.
The	other	major	narrative	of	social	 dilemma 	 s 	 	is	the	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	of	the	 common 	 s 	 	.
 Gar 	 ret 	 t 	 	 Hard 	 in 	 	used	it	to	talk	about	 over 	 population 	 	in	the	late	1960s	.
He	used	the	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	a	common	grazing	area	in	which	each	person	by	 simpl 	 y 	 	 maxim 	 izing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	flock	led	to	 over 	 grazing 	 	and	the	 deple 	 tion 	 	of	the	resource	.
He	had	the	 ra 	 ther 	 	 gloom 	 y 	 	 con 	 clusion 	 	that	 human 	 s 	 	will	 inevit 	 ably 	 	 de 	 spoil 	 	any	common	pool	resource	in	which	people	can	not	be	 re 	 s 	 trained 	 	from	using	it	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	 Eli 	 nor 	 	 O 	 s 	 trom 	 	,	a	 politic 	 al 	 	scientist	,	in	1990	 ask 	 ed 	 	the	 interest 	 ing 	 	question	that	any	good	scientist	should	ask	,	which	is	:	is	it	 re 	 ally 	 	true	that	 human 	 s 	 	will	 al 	 ways 	 	 de 	 spoil 	 	 common 	 s 	 	?
So	she	went	out	and	 look 	 ed 	 	at	what	data	she	could	find	.
She	 look 	 ed 	 	at	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 case 	 s 	 	of	 human 	 s 	 	sharing	 water 	 shed 	 s 	 	,	 forest 	 ry 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	,	 fish 	 eries 	 	,	and	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	 y 	 es 	 	,	in	case	after	case	,	 human 	 s 	 	 destroy 	 ed 	 	the	 common 	 s 	 	that	they	 depend 	 ed 	 	on	.
But	she	 al 	 so 	 	found	 man 	 y 	 	 in 	 stance 	 s 	 	in	which	people	 es 	 cap 	 ed 	 	the	prisoner	's	dilemma	;	in	fact	,	the	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	of	the	 common 	 s 	 	is	a	 multi 	 player 	 	prisoner	's	dilemma	.
And	she	 s 	 aid 	 	that	people	are	 on 	 ly 	 	 prisoner 	 s 	 	if	they	consider	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	to	be	.
 The 	 y 	 	 es 	 cape 	 	by	creating	 institution 	 s 	 	for	 collect 	 ive 	 	action	.
And	she	 discover 	 ed 	 	,	I	think	most	 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	that	among	 t 	 hose 	 	 institution 	 s 	 	that	 work 	 ed 	 	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	a	number	of	common	design	 principle 	 s 	 	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	 principle 	 s 	 	seem	to	be	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	from	 t 	 hose 	 	 institution 	 s 	 	that	do	n't	work	.
I	'm	moving	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	over	a	number	of	 discipline 	 s 	 	.	In	biology	,	the	 not 	 ions 	 	of	 sym 	 bio 	 sis 	 	,	group	 s 	 election 	 	,	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 psycho 	 logy 	 	are	 contest 	 ed 	 	,	to	be	 s 	 ure 	 	.
But	there	is	 re 	 ally 	 	no	 long 	 er 	 	any	major	debate	over	the	fact	that	 co 	 operative 	 	 arrange 	 ments 	 	have	 move 	 d 	 	from	a	 per 	 iph 	 er 	 al 	 	role	to	a	central	role	in	biology	,	from	the	level	of	the	cell	to	the	level	of	the	 eco 	 logy 	 	.
And	 aga 	 in 	 	,	our	 not 	 ions 	 	of	 individual 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	economic	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 over 	 turn 	 ed 	 	.
 R 	 ation 	 al 	 	 self 	 - 	 interest 	 	is	not	 al 	 ways 	 	the	 domin 	 ating 	 	factor	.
In	fact	,	people	will	act	to	punish	 cheat 	 ers 	 	,	even	at	a	cost	to	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
And	most	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	 neuro 	 physiologic 	 al 	 	 measure 	 s 	 	have	 show 	 n 	 	that	people	who	punish	 cheat 	 ers 	 	in	economic	 game 	 s 	 	show	activity	in	the	reward	 center 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	brain	.
 Whi 	 ch 	 	led	one	scientist	to	declare	that	 altruist 	 ic 	 	 punish 	 ment 	 	may	be	the	glue	that	 hold 	 s 	 	 socie 	 ties 	 	together	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	I	've	 be 	 en 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	how	new	 form 	 s 	 	of	communication	and	new	media	in	the	past	have	 help 	 ed 	 	create	new	economic	 form 	 s 	 	.
 Comm 	 er 	 ce 	 	is	ancient	.	 Market 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	old	.	 Cap 	 ital 	 ism 	 	is	 fair 	 ly 	 	 re 	 cent 	 	;	 social 	 ism 	 	 emerge 	 d 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 re 	 action 	 	to	that	.
And	yet	we	see	 ver 	 y 	 	little	talk	about	how	the	next	form	may	be	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	.

 Ver 	 y 	 	 brief 	 ly 	 	,	let	's	look	at	some	 business 	 es 	 	.

 Ab 	 out 	 	a	year	and	a	half	ago	,	 Step 	 hen 	 	 Law 	 ler 	 	,	who	 al 	 so 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	a	talk	here	at	TED	in	2007	on	Virtual	Earth	,	 br 	 ought 	 	me	over	to	 be 	 come 	 	the	architect	of	 B 	 ing 	 	 Map 	 s 	 	,	which	is	 Micro 	 soft 	 	's	 on 	 line 	 - 	 mapping 	 	effort	.
In	the	past	two	and	a	half	,	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	at	work	on	 re 	 defi 	 ning 	 	the	way	 map 	 s 	 	work	 on 	 line 	 	.
And	we	 re 	 ally 	 	are	 see 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	in	 ver 	 y 	 	different	 term 	 s 	 	from	the	kind	of	mapping	and	direction	 s 	 ite 	 	that	one	is	used	to	.
So	,	the	first	thing	that	you	might	notice	about	the	mapping	 s 	 ite 	 	is	just	the	 fluid 	 ity 	 	of	the	 zoom 	 ing 	 	and	the	 pan 	 ning 	 	,	which	,	if	you	're	familiar	at	all	with	 Sea 	 dragon 	 	,	that	's	where	it	 come 	 s 	 	from	.
 Map 	 ping 	 	is	,	of	course	,	not	just	about	 cart 	 ography 	 	,	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	about	 image 	 ry 	 	.
So	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	 zoom 	 - 	 in 	 	beyond	a	certain	level	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 solve 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	kind	of	Sim	 City 	 - 	 like 	 	virtual	view	at	45	 degree 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	can	be	 view 	 ed 	 	from	any	of	the	 card 	 in 	 al 	 	 direction 	 s 	 	to	show	you	the	3D	structure	of	the	city	,	all	the	 facade 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	we	see	 th 	 is 	 	space	,	 th 	 is 	 	 three 	 - 	 dimensional 	 	environment	,	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	a	canvas	on	which	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 application 	 s 	 	can	play	out	,	and	map	's	 direction 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	just	one	of	them	.
If	you	click	on	 th 	 is 	 	,	you	'll	see	some	of	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	we	've	put	out	,	just	in	the	past	couple	of	 month 	 s 	 	since	we	've	 launch 	 ed 	 	.
So	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	a	couple	of	 day 	 s 	 	after	the	disaster	in	Haiti	,	we	had	an	 earth 	 quake 	 	map	that	 show 	 ed 	 	before	and	after	 picture 	 s 	 	from	the	sky	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	one	which	I	do	n't	have	time	to	show	you	is	taking	 hyper 	 - 	 local 	 	 blog 	 s 	 	in	real	time	and	mapping	 t 	 hose 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 ent 	 ries 	 	to	the	 place 	 s 	 	that	are	 refer 	 red 	 	to	on	the	 blog 	 s 	 	.
It	's	 wonder 	 ful 	 	.
But	I	'm	going	to	show	you	some	more	 can 	 dy 	 	sort	of	stuff	.
So	,	we	see	the	 image 	 ry 	 	,	of	course	,	not	 stop 	 ping 	 	at	the	sky	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	little	green	 bubble 	 s 	 	represent	 photo 	 synth 	 s 	 	that	 user 	 s 	 	have	made	.
I	'm	not	going	to	 d 	 ive 	 	 in 	 to 	 	them	either	,	but	 photo 	 synth 	 s 	 	are	 integrate 	 d 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	map	.
 Every 	 thing 	 	that	's	 case 	 d 	 	in	blue	is	an	area	where	we	've	taken	 image 	 ry 	 	on	the	ground	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
And	so	,	when	you	fly	down	--	Thank	you	.	When	you	fly	down	to	the	ground	,	and	you	see	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 pan 	 ora 	 mic 	 	 image 	 ry 	 	,	the	first	thing	that	you	might	notice	is	that	it	's	not	just	a	picture	,	there	's	just	 a 	 s 	 	much	 three 	 - 	 dimensional 	 	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	environment	 a 	 s 	 	there	is	of	the	 three 	 - 	 dimensional 	 	city	from	above	,	so	if	I	click	on	 some 	 thing 	 	to	get	a	 close 	 r 	 	view	of	it	,	then	,	the	fact	that	that	 transit 	 ion 	 	 look 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	 do 	 es 	 	,	is	a	function	of	all	of	that	 geo 	 metry 	 	,	all	of	that	3D	 understand 	 ing 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	 th 	 is 	 	model	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	I	'll	show	you	a	 f 	 un 	 	app	that	--	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	a	 collabor 	 ation 	 	with	our	 friend 	 s 	 	at	Flickr	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 take 	 s 	 	Flickr	,	 geo 	 register 	 ed 	 	 image 	 ry 	 	and	uses	 photo 	 synth 	 - 	 like 	 	 process 	 es 	 	to	connect	that	 image 	 ry 	 	to	our	 image 	 ry 	 	,	so	--	I	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	if	that	's	the	one	I	 actual 	 ly 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	to	pull	up	,	but	--	But	notice	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	of	course	,	a	popular	tourist	 s 	 ite 	 	,	and	there	are	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 photo 	 s 	 	around	here	,	and	these	 photo 	 s 	 	are	all	taken	at	different	 time 	 s 	 	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	one	was	taken	around	five	.
So	that	's	the	Flickr	photo	,	that	's	our	 image 	 ry 	 	.
So	you	 re 	 ally 	 	see	how	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 crowd 	 - 	 sourced 	 	 image 	 ry 	 	is	 integ 	 rating 	 	,	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	deep	way	,	 in 	 to 	 	the	map	 it 	 self 	 	.
Thank	you	.
There	are	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 reason 	 s 	 	why	 th 	 is 	 	is	 interest 	 ing 	 	and	one	of	them	,	of	course	,	is	time	travel	.
And	I	'm	not	going	to	show	you	some	of	the	 wonder 	 ful 	 	historic	 image 	 ry 	 	in	here	,	but	there	are	some	with	 horse 	 s 	 	and	 carriage 	 s 	 	and	so	on	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
But	what	's	cool	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	is	it	 augment 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	visual	 represent 	 ation 	 	of	the	world	with	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	coming	in	from	 user 	 s 	 	,	but	it	 al 	 so 	 	is	the	 found 	 ation 	 	for	 augment 	 ed 	 	 re 	 ality 	 	,	and	that	's	 some 	 thing 	 	that	I	'll	be	 show 	 ing 	 	you	more	of	in	just	a	moment	.
 N 	 ow 	 	I	just	made	a	 transit 	 ion 	 	 in 	 door 	 s 	 	.	That	's	 al 	 so 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
 O 	 K 	 	,	notice	there	's	now	a	roof	above	us	.
We	're	 in 	 side 	 	the	 Pi 	 ke 	 	Place	Market	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	're	able	to	do	with	a	 back 	 pack 	 	camera	,	so	,	we	're	now	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 im 	 aging 	 	in	the	street	with	 th 	 is 	 	camera	on	 top 	 s 	 	of	 car 	 s 	 	,	but	we	're	 al 	 so 	 	 im 	 aging 	 	 in 	 side 	 	.
And	from	here	,	we	're	able	to	do	the	same	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 registr 	 ation 	 	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	of	still	 image 	 s 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	of	video	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	're	now	going	to	try	for	the	first	time	,	live	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 tru 	 ly 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 frighten 	 ing 	 	.
 O 	 K 	 	.
All	right	,	 guy 	 s 	 	,	are	you	there	?
All	right	.	I	'm	hitting	it	.	I	'm	 punch 	 ing 	 	play	.
I	'm	live	.	All	right	.	There	we	go	.
So	,	these	are	our	 friend 	 s 	 	in	 Pi 	 ke 	 	Place	Market	,	the	lab	.
So	they	're	 broad 	 cast 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	live	.
 O 	 K 	 	,	George	,	can	you	pan	back	over	to	the	corner	market	?
 Be 	 cause 	 	I	want	to	show	 point 	 s 	 	of	interest	.
No	,	no	.	The	other	way	.
Yeah	,	 yea 	 h 	 	,	back	to	the	corner	,	back	to	the	corner	.
I	do	n't	want	to	see	you	 guy 	 s 	 	yet	.
 O 	 K 	 	,	 O 	 K 	 	,	back	to	the	corner	,	back	to	the	corner	,	back	to	the	corner	.
 O 	 K 	 	,	never	mind	.
What	I	 want 	 ed 	 	to	show	you	was	these	 point 	 s 	 	of	interest	over	here	on	top	of	the	image	 be 	 cause 	 	what	that	 give 	 s 	 	you	a	sense	of	is	the	way	,	if	you	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	on	the	spot	,	you	can	think	about	 th 	 is 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	taking	a	step	in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	 augment 	 ed 	 	 re 	 ality 	 	.
What	the	hell	are	you	 guy 	 s 	 	--	oh	,	sorry	.
We	're	 do 	 ing 	 	two	different	--	 O 	 K 	 	,	I	'm	 hang 	 ing 	 	up	now	.
We	're	 do 	 ing 	 	two	different	 thing 	 s 	 	here	.
One	of	them	is	to	take	that	real	...
All	right	,	let	me	just	take	a	moment	and	thank	the	team	.
 The 	 y 	 	've	 d 	 one 	 	a	fantastic	job	of	 pull 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	together	.
I	'm	going	to	abandon	them	now	and	walk	back	 out 	 side 	 	.
And	while	I	walk	 out 	 side 	 	,	I	'll	just	 ment 	 ion 	 	that	here	we	're	using	 th 	 is 	 	for	 tele 	 presence 	 	,	but	you	can	 equal 	 ly 	 	well	use	 th 	 is 	 	on	the	spot	,	for	 augment 	 ed 	 	 re 	 ality 	 	.
When	you	use	it	on	the	spot	,	it	 mean 	 s 	 	that	you	're	able	to	 br 	 ing 	 	all	of	that	 meta 	 data 	 	and	information	about	the	world	to	you	.
So	here	,	we	're	taking	the	extra	step	of	 al 	 so 	 	 broad 	 cast 	 ing 	 	it	.
That	was	 be 	 ing 	 	 broad 	 cast 	 	,	by	the	way	,	on	a	4G	network	from	the	market	.
All	right	,	and	now	there	's	one	last	TED	talk	that	 Micro 	 soft 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 give 	 n 	 	in	the	past	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 year 	 s 	 	.
And	that	's	 Cu 	 rtis 	 	 W 	 ong 	 	,	 World 	 Wide 	 	 Tele 	 scope 	 	.
So	,	we	're	going	to	head	over	to	the	 dump 	 sters 	 	,	where	it	's	 tradition 	 al 	 	,	after	a	long	day	at	the	market	,	to	go	out	for	a	break	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	 star 	 e 	 	up	at	the	sky	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	 integ 	 ration 	 	of	 World 	 Wide 	 	 Tele 	 scope 	 	 in 	 to 	 	our	 map 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	current	--	thank	you	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	current	time	.	If	we	scrub	the	time	,	then	we	can	see	how	the	sky	will	look	at	different	 time 	 s 	 	,	and	we	can	get	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 detail 	 ed 	 	information	about	different	 time 	 s 	 	,	different	 date 	 s 	 	:	Let	's	move	the	moon	a	little	 high 	 er 	 	in	the	sky	,	 may 	 be 	 	change	the	date	.
I	would	like	to	kind	of	zoom	in	on	the	moon	.
So	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 astronomical 	 ly 	 	complete	 represent 	 ation 	 	of	the	sky	 integrate 	 d 	 	right	 in 	 to 	 	the	Earth	.
All	right	now	,	I	've	 over 	 run 	 	my	time	,	so	I	've	got	to	stop	.
Thank	you	all	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
I	 normal 	 ly 	 	teach	 course 	 s 	 	on	how	to	 re 	 build 	 	 state 	 s 	 	after	war	.
But	 to 	 day 	 	I	've	got	a	personal	story	to	share	with	you	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	of	my	family	,	my	four	 s 	 i 	 bling 	 s 	 	--	my	mom	and	I	--	taken	in	1977	.
And	we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 Cambodia 	 ns 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	picture	is	taken	in	Vietnam	.
So	how	did	a	 Cambodia 	 n 	 	family	end	up	in	Vietnam	in	1977	?
Well	to	explain	that	,	I	've	got	a	short	video	clip	to	explain	the	 K 	 hm 	 er 	 	 Ro 	 uge 	 	regime	 dur 	 ing 	 	1975	and	1979	.
 V 	 ideo 	 	:	April	17th	,	1975	.
The	 commun 	 ist 	 	 K 	 hm 	 er 	 	 Ro 	 uge 	 	 enter 	 s 	 	 Ph 	 nom 	 	 Pen 	 h 	 	to	liberate	 the 	 ir 	 	people	from	the	 encroach 	 ing 	 	conflict	in	Vietnam	,	and	American	 bomb 	 ing 	 	 campaign 	 s 	 	.
 L 	 ed 	 	by	 peasant 	 - 	 born 	 	Pol	Pot	,	the	 K 	 hm 	 er 	 	 Ro 	 uge 	 	 evacuate 	 s 	 	people	to	the	 country 	 side 	 	in	order	to	create	a	 r 	 ural 	 	 commun 	 ist 	 	utopia	,	much	like	 Ma 	 o 	 	 Tse 	 - 	 t 	 ung 	 	's	 Cultur 	 al 	 	 R 	 evolution 	 	in	China	.
The	 K 	 hm 	 er 	 	 Ro 	 uge 	 	 close 	 s 	 	the	 door 	 s 	 	to	the	 out 	 side 	 	world	.
But	after	four	 year 	 s 	 	the	grim	truth	 seep 	 s 	 	out	.
In	a	country	of	 on 	 ly 	 	seven	million	people	,	one	and	a	half	million	 we 	 re 	 	 murder 	 ed 	 	by	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 lead 	 ers 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	bodies	 pil 	 ed 	 	in	the	mass	 grave 	 s 	 	of	the	 kill 	 ing 	 	 field 	 s 	 	.
 So 	 phal 	 	Ear	:	So	,	 not 	 with 	 stand 	 ing 	 	the	1970s	 nar 	 ration 	 	,	on	April	17th	1975	we	lived	in	 Ph 	 nom 	 	 Pen 	 h 	 	.
And	my	 parent 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	told	by	the	 K 	 hm 	 er 	 	 Ro 	 uge 	 	to	evacuate	the	city	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 imp 	 end 	 ing 	 	American	 bomb 	 ing 	 	for	three	 day 	 s 	 	.
And	here	is	a	picture	of	the	 K 	 hm 	 er 	 	 Ro 	 uge 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	 we 	 re 	 	young	 soldier 	 s 	 	,	 typical 	 ly 	 	child	 soldier 	 s 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	normal	now	,	of	modern	day	conflict	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	easy	to	 br 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 war 	 s 	 	.
The	reason	that	they	 g 	 ave 	 	about	American	 bomb 	 ing 	 	was	n't	all	that	far	off	.
I	mean	,	from	1965	to	1973	there	 we 	 re 	 	more	 mun 	 ition 	 s 	 	that	fell	on	Cambodia	than	in	all	of	World	War	 I 	 I 	 	Japan	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	the	two	nuclear	 bomb 	 s 	 	of	 Au 	 gust 	 	1945	.
The	 K 	 hm 	 er 	 	 Ro 	 uge 	 	did	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	in	money	.
So	the	 equi 	 valent 	 	of	the	 Feder 	 al 	 	 Re 	 serve 	 	Bank	in	Cambodia	was	 bomb 	 ed 	 	.
But	not	just	that	,	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	 bann 	 ed 	 	money	.
I	think	it	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 precede 	 nt 	 	in	which	money	 ha 	 s 	 	ever	 be 	 en 	 	 stop 	 ped 	 	from	 be 	 ing 	 	used	.
And	we	know	money	is	the	root	of	all	 e 	 vil 	 	,	but	it	did	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	stop	 e 	 vil 	 	from	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	Cambodia	,	in	fact	.
My	family	was	 move 	 d 	 	from	 Ph 	 nom 	 	 Pen 	 h 	 	to	 Pur 	 s 	 at 	 	 pro 	 vince 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	of	what	 Pur 	 s 	 at 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
It	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	area	of	Cambodia	,	where	rice	growing	 take 	 s 	 	place	.
And	in	fact	they	 we 	 re 	 	 force 	 d 	 	to	work	the	 field 	 s 	 	.
So	my	father	and	mother	 end 	 ed 	 	up	in	a	sort	of	 concent 	 ration 	 	camp	,	labor	camp	.
And	it	was	at	that	time	that	my	mother	got	word	from	the	 commun 	 e 	 	chief	that	the	 Vietnam 	 ese 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 citizen 	 s 	 	to	go	back	to	Vietnam	.
And	she	spoke	some	 Vietnam 	 ese 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	child	 hav 	 ing 	 	grown	up	with	 Vietnam 	 ese 	 	 friend 	 s 	 	.
And	she	 decide 	 d 	 	,	 de 	 spite 	 	the	 ad 	 vice 	 	of	her	 neighbor 	 s 	 	,	that	she	would	take	the	chance	and	claim	to	be	 Vietnam 	 ese 	 	so	that	we	could	have	a	chance	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	they	're	forcing	 every 	 body 	 	to	work	.
And	they	're	giving	about	--	in	a	 modern 	 - 	 day 	 	,	 caloric 	 - 	 restrict 	 ion 	 	diet	,	I	guess	--	they	're	giving	 por 	 ridge 	 	,	with	a	few	 grain 	 s 	 	of	rice	.
And	at	about	 th 	 is 	 	time	 actual 	 ly 	 	my	father	got	 ver 	 y 	 	sick	.
And	he	did	n't	speak	 Vietnam 	 ese 	 	.
So	he	 di 	 ed 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	in	 Jan 	 uary 	 	1976	.
And	it	made	it	possible	,	in	fact	,	for	us	to	take	on	 th 	 is 	 	plan	.
So	the	 K 	 hm 	 er 	 	 Ro 	 uge 	 	took	us	from	a	place	 call 	 ed 	 	 Pur 	 s 	 at 	 	to	 Ka 	 oh 	 	 T 	 iev 	 	,	which	is	 a 	 cross 	 	from	the	border	from	Vietnam	.
And	there	they	had	a	 de 	 tent 	 ion 	 	camp	where	 alle 	 ged 	 	 Vietnam 	 ese 	 	would	be	tested	,	language	tested	.
And	my	mother	's	 Vietnam 	 ese 	 	was	so	bad	that	to	make	our	story	more	credible	,	she	'd	 give 	 n 	 	all	the	 boy 	 s 	 	and	 girl 	 s 	 	new	 Vietnam 	 ese 	 	 name 	 s 	 	.
But	she	'd	 give 	 n 	 	the	 boy 	 s 	 	 girl 	 s 	 	'	 name 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 girl 	 s 	 	 boy 	 s 	 	'	 name 	 s 	 	.
And	it	was	n't	 un 	 til 	 	she	met	a	 Vietnam 	 ese 	 	 lad 	 y 	 	who	told	her	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	then	 tutor 	 ed 	 	her	for	two	 day 	 s 	 	 intensive 	 ly 	 	,	that	she	was	able	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	her	 ex 	 am 	 	and	--	you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	moment	of	truth	.
If	she	 fail 	 s 	 	,	we	're	all	headed	to	the	 gal 	 low 	 s 	 	;	if	she	 pass 	 es 	 	,	we	can	 leav 	 e 	 	to	Vietnam	.
And	she	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	of	course	--	I	'm	here	,	she	 pass 	 es 	 	.
And	we	end	up	in	 H 	 ong 	 	 N 	 gu 	 	on	the	 Vietnam 	 ese 	 	side	.
And	then	 on 	 ward 	 s 	 	to	Chau	Doc	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	of	 H 	 ong 	 	 N 	 gu 	 	,	Vietnam	 to 	 day 	 	.
A	 pre 	 tty 	 	 idy 	 llic 	 	place	on	the	Mekong	 Del 	 ta 	 	.
But	for	us	it	 me 	 ant 	 	 free 	 dom 	 	.
And	 free 	 dom 	 	from	 per 	 sec 	 ution 	 	from	the	 K 	 hm 	 er 	 	 Ro 	 uge 	 	.
Last	year	,	the	 K 	 hm 	 er 	 	 Ro 	 uge 	 	 Tri 	 bun 	 al 	 	,	which	the	 U. 	 N. 	 	is	 help 	 ing 	 	Cambodia	take	on	,	 start 	 ed 	 	,	and	I	 decide 	 d 	 	that	 a 	 s 	 	a	matter	of	record	I	should	file	a	Civil	 Com 	 plain 	 t 	 	with	the	 Tri 	 bun 	 al 	 	about	my	father	's	 pass 	 ing 	 	away	.
And	I	got	word	last	month	that	the	 complain 	 t 	 	was	 official 	 ly 	 	 accept 	 ed 	 	by	the	 K 	 hm 	 er 	 	 Ro 	 uge 	 	 Tri 	 bun 	 al 	 	.
And	it	's	for	me	a	matter	of	justice	for	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	and	 account 	 ability 	 	for	the	future	,	 be 	 cause 	 	Cambodia	 remain 	 s 	 	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	 law 	 less 	 	place	,	at	 time 	 s 	 	.
Five	 year 	 s 	 	ago	my	mother	and	I	went	back	to	Chau	Doc	.
And	she	was	able	to	return	to	a	place	that	for	her	 me 	 ant 	 	 free 	 dom 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	fear	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	had	just	come	out	of	Cambodia	.
I	'm	happy	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 to 	 day 	 	,	to	present	her	.
She	's	here	 to 	 day 	 	with	us	in	the	audience	.
Thank	you	mother	.
So	I	want	to	tell	you	a	story	--	an	 encourag 	 ing 	 	story	--	about	 address 	 ing 	 	 de 	 s 	 per 	 ation 	 	,	 depress 	 ion 	 	and	despair	in	 Afghan 	 istan 	 	,	and	what	we	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	from	it	,	and	how	to	help	people	to	 over 	 come 	 	 trauma 	 tic 	 	 experience 	 s 	 	and	how	to	help	them	to	regain	some	confidence	in	the	time	 a 	 head 	 	--	in	the	future	--	and	how	to	 particip 	 ate 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	in	 every 	 day 	 	life	.
So	,	I	am	a	 Jung 	 ian 	 	 psycho 	 analyst 	 	,	and	I	went	to	 Afghan 	 istan 	 	in	 Jan 	 uary 	 	2004	,	by	chance	,	on	an	 assign 	 ment 	 	for	Medica	 Mon 	 dial 	 e 	 	.
Jung	in	 Afghan 	 istan 	 	--	you	get	the	picture	.
 Afghan 	 istan 	 	is	one	of	the	 poor 	 est 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	in	the	world	,	and	70	percent	of	the	people	are	illiterate	.
War	and	 mal 	 nutrition 	 	 kill 	 s 	 	people	together	with	hope	.
You	may	know	 th 	 is 	 	from	the	media	,	but	what	you	may	not	know	is	that	the	average	age	of	the	Afghan	people	is	17	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	they	grow	up	in	 s 	 uch 	 	an	environment	and	--	I	repeat	 my 	 self 	 	--	in	30	 year 	 s 	 	of	war	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	 transl 	 ates 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 on 	 going 	 	violence	,	foreign	 interest 	 s 	 	,	 bribe 	 ry 	 	,	 drug 	 s 	 	,	ethnic	 conflict 	 s 	 	,	bad	health	,	shame	,	fear	and	cumulative	 trauma 	 tic 	 	 experience 	 s 	 	.
 Lo 	 c 	 al 	 	and	foreign	 militar 	 y 	 	are	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	build	peace	together	with	the	 donor 	 s 	 	and	the	 government 	 al 	 	and	 non 	 - 	 government 	 al 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	.
And	people	had	hope	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	but	 un 	 til 	 	they	 real 	 ized 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	 worsen 	 s 	 	every	day	--	either	 be 	 cause 	 	they	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 kill 	 ed 	 	or	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 some 	 how 	 	,	they	are	 poor 	 er 	 	than	eight	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
One	figure	for	that	:	54	percent	of	the	children	under	the	age	of	five	 year 	 s 	 	suffer	from	 mal 	 nutrition 	 	.
 Y 	 et 	 	,	there	is	hope	.
One	day	a	man	told	me	,	``	My	future	 do 	 es 	 	not	look	 brilli 	 ant 	 	,	but	I	want	to	have	a	 brilli 	 ant 	 	future	for	my	son	.	''
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	I	took	in	2005	,	 walk 	 ing 	 	on	 Frida 	 y 	 s 	 	over	the	 hill 	 s 	 	in	Kabul	,	and	for	me	it	's	a	 symbol 	 ic 	 	picture	of	an	open	future	for	a	young	generation	.
So	,	 doctor 	 s 	 	 pre 	 scribe 	 	 medic 	 ation 	 	.
And	 donor 	 s 	 	are	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	peace	by	building	 school 	 s 	 	and	 road 	 s 	 	.
 Mili 	 tary 	 	collect	 weapon 	 s 	 	,	and	 depress 	 ion 	 	 stay 	 s 	 	 in 	 tact 	 	.
Why	?
 Be 	 cause 	 	people	do	n't	have	 tool 	 s 	 	to	cope	with	it	,	to	get	over	it	.
So	,	soon	after	my	 arriv 	 al 	 	,	I	had	 confirm 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	which	I	had	 al 	 ready 	 	known	;	that	my	 instrument 	 s 	 	come	from	the	heart	of	modern	 Euro 	 pe 	 	,	 y 	 es 	 	.
 How 	 ever 	 	,	what	can	wound	us	and	our	 re 	 action 	 	to	 t 	 hose 	 	 wound 	 s 	 	--	they	are	universal	.
And	the	big	 challeng 	 e 	 	was	how	to	understand	the	meaning	of	the	symptom	in	 th 	 is 	 	specific	cultural	 con 	 text 	 	.
After	a	 counsel 	 ing 	 	session	,	a	woman	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	,	``	 Be 	 cause 	 	you	have	felt	me	,	I	can	feel	 my 	 self 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	,	and	I	want	to	 particip 	 ate 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	in	my	family	life	.	''
 Th 	 is 	 	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	family	is	central	in	 Afghan 	 s 	 	'	social	system	.
No	one	can	 surviv 	 e 	 	 al 	 one 	 	.
And	if	people	feel	used	,	 worth 	 less 	 	and	 a 	 shame 	 d 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 horr 	 ible 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	them	,	then	they	 re 	 treat 	 	,	and	they	fall	 in 	 to 	 	social	 isol 	 ation 	 	,	and	they	do	not	 da 	 re 	 	to	tell	 th 	 is 	 	 e 	 vil 	 	to	other	people	or	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 love 	 d 	 	 one 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	do	not	want	to	burden	them	.
And	 ver 	 y 	 	often	violence	is	a	way	to	cope	with	it	.
 Tra 	 um 	 at 	 ized 	 	people	 al 	 so 	 	 eas 	 ily 	 	lose	control	--	 symptom 	 s 	 	are	 hyper 	 - 	 arousal 	 	and	 memor 	 y 	 	 flash 	 back 	 s 	 	--	so	people	are	in	a	constant	fear	that	 t 	 hose 	 	 horr 	 ible 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	that	 trauma 	 tic 	 	event	might	come	back	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 ly 	 	,	 sudden 	 ly 	 	,	and	they	can	not	control	it	.
To	 compens 	 ate 	 	 th 	 is 	 	loss	of	inner	control	,	they	try	to	control	the	 out 	 side 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 understand 	 ably 	 	--	 most 	 ly 	 	the	family	--	and	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 fit 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	well	 in 	 to 	 	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	side	,	 regress 	 ive 	 	side	,	 repress 	 ive 	 	side	,	 restrict 	 ive 	 	side	of	the	cultural	 con 	 text 	 	.
So	,	 husband 	 s 	 	start	 beat 	 ing 	 	wives	,	 mother 	 s 	 	and	 father 	 s 	 	beat	 the 	 ir 	 	children	,	and	 after 	 ward 	 	,	they	feel	awful	.
 The 	 y 	 	did	not	want	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	it	just	 happen 	 ed 	 	--	they	lost	control	.
The	desperate	try	to	 re 	 store 	 	order	and	 normal 	 ity 	 	,	and	if	we	are	not	able	to	cut	 th 	 is 	 	circle	of	violence	,	it	will	be	 transfer 	 red 	 	to	the	next	generation	 with 	 out 	 	a	doubt	.
And	 part 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	 al 	 ready 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
So	 every 	 body 	 	 need 	 s 	 	a	sense	for	the	future	,	and	the	Afghan	sense	of	the	future	is	 shatter 	 ed 	 	.
But	let	me	repeat	the	 word 	 s 	 	of	the	woman	.
``	 Be 	 cause 	 	you	have	felt	me	,	I	can	feel	 my 	 self 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.	''
So	the	key	here	is	 empath 	 y 	 	.
 Some 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	a	witness	to	what	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	you	.
 Some 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	feel	how	you	felt	.
And	 some 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	see	you	and	listen	to	you	.
 Every 	 body 	 	must	be	able	to	know	what	he	or	she	 ha 	 s 	 	 experience 	 d 	 	is	true	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	 go 	 es 	 	with	 an 	 other 	 	person	.
So	 every 	 body 	 	must	be	able	to	say	,	``	 Th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	me	,	and	it	did	 th 	 is 	 	with	me	,	but	I	'm	able	to	live	with	it	,	to	cope	with	it	,	and	to	learn	from	it	.
And	I	want	to	engage	 my 	 self 	 	in	the	bright	future	for	my	children	and	the	children	of	my	children	,	and	I	will	not	 marry 	 - 	 off 	 	my	13	 year 	 - 	 old 	 	daughter	,	''	--	what	 happen 	 s 	 	too	often	in	 Afghan 	 istan 	 	.
So	 some 	 thing 	 	can	be	 d 	 one 	 	,	even	in	 s 	 uch 	 	 extrem 	 e 	 	 environment 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 Afghan 	 istan 	 	.
And	I	 start 	 ed 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	a	 counsel 	 ing 	 	program	.
But	,	of	course	,	I	 need 	 ed 	 	help	and	 fund 	 s 	 	.
And	one	 even 	 ing 	 	,	I	was	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	next	to	a	 ver 	 y 	 	nice	 gentle 	 man 	 	in	Kabul	,	and	he	 ask 	 ed 	 	what	I	thought	would	be	good	in	 Afghan 	 istan 	 	.
And	I	 explain 	 ed 	 	to	him	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	I	would	train	 psycho 	 - 	 social 	 	 counsel 	 ors 	 	,	I	would	open	 center 	 s 	 	,	and	I	 explain 	 ed 	 	to	him	why	.
 Th 	 is 	 	man	 g 	 ave 	 	me	his	contact	 detail 	 s 	 	at	the	end	of	the	 even 	 ing 	 	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	If	you	want	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	call	me	.	''
At	that	time	,	it	was	the	head	of	 Car 	 ita 	 s 	 	 German 	 y 	 	.
So	,	I	was	able	to	launch	a	 three 	 - 	 year 	 	project	with	 Car 	 ita 	 s 	 	 German 	 y 	 	,	and	we	trained	30	Afghan	women	and	men	,	and	we	 open 	 ed 	 	15	 counsel 	 ing 	 	 center 	 s 	 	in	Kabul	.
 Th 	 is 	 	was	our	sign	--	it	's	 hand 	 - 	 paint 	 ed 	 	,	and	we	had	45	all	over	Kabul	.
 Elev 	 en 	 	thousand	people	came	--	more	than	that	.
And	70	percent	 regain 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	time	,	 develop 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	with	my	 wonder 	 ful 	 	Afghan	team	.
And	they	are	 work 	 ing 	 	with	me	up	to	 to 	 day 	 	.
We	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	 cultural 	 ly 	 - 	 sensitive 	 	 psycho 	 - 	 social 	 	 counsel 	 ing 	 	approach	.
So	,	from	2008	up	 un 	 til 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	a	 sub 	 stantial 	 	change	and	step	forward	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	taking	place	.
The	European	 Un 	 ion 	 	 deleg 	 ation 	 	in	Kabul	came	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	and	 hire 	 d 	 	me	to	work	 in 	 side 	 	the	 Mini 	 stry 	 	of	 Pub 	 lic 	 	Health	,	to	lobby	 th 	 is 	 	approach	--	we	 succeed 	 ed 	 	.
We	 revise 	 d 	 	the	mental	health	component	of	the	 prim 	 ary 	 	health	care	 service 	 s 	 	by	 add 	 ing 	 	 psycho 	 - 	 social 	 	care	and	 psycho 	 - 	 social 	 	 counsel 	 ors 	 	to	the	system	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	,	 certain 	 ly 	 	,	to	 re 	 train 	 	all	health	staff	.
But	for	that	,	we	 al 	 ready 	 	have	the	training	 manual 	 s 	 	,	which	are	approved	by	the	 Mini 	 stry 	 	and	 more 	 over 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	approach	is	now	part	of	the	mental	health	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	in	 Afghan 	 istan 	 	.
So	we	 al 	 so 	 	have	 implement 	 ed 	 	it	 al 	 ready 	 	in	some	 select 	 ed 	 	 clinic 	 s 	 	in	three	 pro 	 vince 	 s 	 	,	and	you	are	the	first	to	see	the	 result 	 s 	 	.
We	 want 	 ed 	 	to	know	if	what	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 d 	 one 	 	is	effective	.
And	here	you	can	see	the	 patient 	 s 	 	all	had	 symptom 	 s 	 	of	 depress 	 ion 	 	,	moderate	and	severe	.
And	the	red	line	is	the	 treat 	 ment 	 	 a 	 s 	 	usual	--	 medic 	 ation 	 	with	a	medical	doctor	.
And	all	the	 symptom 	 s 	 	 stay 	 ed 	 	the	same	or	even	got	 wo 	 rse 	 	.
And	the	green	line	is	 treat 	 ment 	 	with	 psycho 	 - 	 social 	 	 counsel 	 ing 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	 medic 	 ation 	 	.
And	you	can	see	the	 symptom 	 s 	 	 al 	 most 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	go	away	,	and	the	 psycho 	 - 	 social 	 	stress	 ha 	 s 	 	 drop 	 ped 	 	 significant 	 ly 	 	,	which	is	explicable	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	can	not	take	away	the	 psycho 	 - 	 social 	 	 stress 	 es 	 	,	but	you	can	learn	how	to	cope	with	them	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	 make 	 s 	 	us	 ver 	 y 	 	happy	,	 be 	 cause 	 	now	we	 al 	 so 	 	have	some	evidence	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	 work 	 ing 	 	.
So	here	you	see	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	health	 facil 	 ity 	 	in	 North 	 ern 	 	 Afghan 	 istan 	 	,	and	every	 morn 	 ing 	 	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	all	over	.
And	 doctor 	 s 	 	 usual 	 ly 	 	have	three	to	six	 minute 	 s 	 	for	the	 patient 	 s 	 	,	but	now	 th 	 is 	 	will	change	.
 The 	 y 	 	go	to	the	 clinic 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	want	to	cure	 the 	 ir 	 	 im 	 mediate 	 	 symptom 	 s 	 	,	and	they	will	find	 some 	 body 	 	to	talk	to	and	discuss	these	 issue 	 s 	 	and	talk	about	what	is	 burden 	 ing 	 	them	and	find	 solution 	 s 	 	,	develop	 the 	 ir 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	,	learn	 tool 	 s 	 	to	solve	 the 	 ir 	 	family	 conflict 	 s 	 	and	gain	some	confidence	in	the	future	.
And	I	would	like	to	share	one	short	vignette	.
One	Hazara	 s 	 aid 	 	to	his	Pashtun	 counsel 	 or 	 	,	``	If	we	 we 	 re 	 	to	have	met	some	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	then	we	would	have	 kill 	 ed 	 	each	other	.
And	now	you	are	 help 	 ing 	 	me	to	regain	some	confidence	in	the	future	.	''
And	 an 	 other 	 	 counsel 	 or 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	after	the	training	,	``	You	know	,	I	never	 k 	 new 	 	why	I	 surviv 	 ed 	 	the	 kill 	 ing 	 s 	 	in	my	village	,	but	now	I	know	,	 be 	 cause 	 	I	am	part	of	a	nucleus	of	a	new	 peace 	 ful 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	in	 Afghan 	 istan 	 	.	''
So	I	 believ 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 ke 	 pt 	 	me	running	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 emancip 	 atory 	 	and	 politic 	 al 	 	 con 	 trib 	 ution 	 	to	peace	and	 reconcili 	 ation 	 	.
And	 al 	 so 	 	--	I	think	--	 with 	 out 	 	 psycho 	 - 	 social 	 	therapy	,	and	 with 	 out 	 	 consider 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	in	all	 human 	 itarian 	 	 project 	 s 	 	,	we	can	not	 build 	 - 	 up 	 	civil	 socie 	 ties 	 	.
I	thought	it	was	an	idea	worth	 spread 	 ing 	 	,	and	I	think	it	must	be	,	can	be	,	could	be	 replicate 	 d 	 	 else 	 where 	 	.
I	thank	you	for	your	attention	.
Chris	 And 	 er 	 son 	 	:	Let	's	now	see	the	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	speech	that	we	 capture 	 d 	 	a	couple	 week 	 s 	 	ago	.
Jose	 Anton 	 io 	 	 Ab 	 re 	 u 	 	:	My	dear	 friend 	 s 	 	,	 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	,	I	am	 over 	 joy 	 ed 	 	 to 	 day 	 	at	 be 	 ing 	 	 a 	 ward 	 ed 	 	the	TED	Prize	on	 be 	 half 	 	of	all	the	 distinguish 	 ed 	 	music	 teacher 	 s 	 	,	 artist 	 s 	 	and	 educ 	 ators 	 	from	Venezuela	who	have	 self 	 lessly 	 	and	 loyal 	 ly 	 	 accompani 	 ed 	 	me	for	35	 year 	 s 	 	in	 found 	 ing 	 	,	growing	and	 develop 	 ing 	 	in	Venezuela	the	National	System	of	 You 	 th 	 	and	 Child 	 ren 	 	's	 Orchestra 	 s 	 	and	 Choi 	 rs 	 	.
Since	I	was	a	boy	,	in	my	early	 child 	 hood 	 	,	I	 al 	 ways 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	a	 music 	 ian 	 	,	and	,	thank	God	,	I	made	it	.
From	my	 teacher 	 s 	 	,	my	family	and	my	community	,	I	had	all	the	 necess 	 ary 	 	support	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	 music 	 ian 	 	.
All	my	life	I	've	 dream 	 ed 	 	that	all	 Venezuela 	 n 	 	children	have	the	same	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	that	I	had	.
From	that	 desir 	 e 	 	and	from	my	heart	 stem 	 med 	 	the	idea	to	make	music	a	deep	and	global	 re 	 ality 	 	for	my	country	.
From	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	 rehears 	 al 	 	,	I	saw	the	bright	future	 a 	 head 	 	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	the	 rehears 	 al 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	a	great	 challeng 	 e 	 	to	me	.
I	had	 receiv 	 ed 	 	a	 don 	 ation 	 	of	50	music	 stand 	 s 	 	to	be	used	by	100	 boy 	 s 	 	in	that	 rehears 	 al 	 	.
When	I	 arriv 	 ed 	 	at	the	 rehears 	 al 	 	,	 on 	 ly 	 	11	 kid 	 s 	 	had	 show 	 n 	 	up	,	and	I	 s 	 aid 	 	to	 my 	 self 	 	,	``	Do	I	close	the	program	or	 multi 	 ply 	 	these	 kid 	 s 	 	?	''
I	 decide 	 d 	 	to	face	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	,	and	on	that	same	night	,	I	 promise 	 d 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	11	children	I	'd	turn	our	orchestra	 in 	 to 	 	one	of	the	 lead 	 ing 	 	 orchestra 	 s 	 	in	the	world	.
Two	 month 	 s 	 	ago	,	I	 remember 	 ed 	 	that	promise	I	made	,	when	a	 distinguish 	 ed 	 	English	critic	 publish 	 ed 	 	an	article	in	the	London	 Time 	 s 	 	,	 ask 	 ing 	 	who	could	be	the	winner	of	the	Orchestra	World	 C 	 up 	 	.
He	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	four	great	world	 orchestra 	 s 	 	,	and	the	fifth	one	was	Venezuela	's	 You 	 th 	 	 Sym 	 phony 	 	Orchestra	.
 To 	 day 	 	we	can	say	that	art	in	 Lat 	 in 	 	America	is	no	 long 	 er 	 	a	 monopol 	 y 	 	of	 elite 	 s 	 	and	that	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	a	social	right	,	a	right	for	all	the	people	.
Child	:	There	is	no	 differ 	 ence 	 	here	between	 class 	 es 	 	,	nor	white	or	black	,	nor	if	you	have	money	or	not	.
 Sim 	 ply 	 	,	if	you	are	 talent 	 ed 	 	,	if	you	have	the	 voc 	 ation 	 	and	the	will	to	be	here	,	you	get	in	.	You	share	with	us	and	make	music	.
 J 	 A 	 	:	 Dur 	 ing 	 	the	 re 	 cent 	 	tour	by	the	 Sim 	 on 	 	 Bo 	 liv 	 ar 	 	 You 	 th 	 	Orchestra	of	Venezuela	of	U.S.	and	 Euro 	 pe 	 	,	we	saw	how	our	music	 move 	 d 	 	young	 audience 	 s 	 	to	the	bottom	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 soul 	 s 	 	,	how	children	and	 adolescent 	 s 	 	 rush 	 ed 	 	up	to	the	stage	to	 receiv 	 e 	 	the	 jacket 	 s 	 	from	our	 music 	 ians 	 	,	how	the	 stand 	 ing 	 	 ov 	 ations 	 	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	30	 minute 	 s 	 	long	,	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	last	 fore 	 ver 	 	,	and	how	the	public	,	after	the	concert	was	over	,	went	out	 in 	 to 	 	the	street	to	greet	our	young	people	in	triumph	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	not	 on 	 ly 	 	an	 art 	 istic 	 	triumph	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	a	 pro 	 found 	 	 emotion 	 al 	 	 sympath 	 y 	 	between	the	public	of	the	most	 advance 	 d 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	of	the	world	and	the	musical	youth	of	 Lat 	 in 	 	America	,	 a 	 s 	 	 s 	 een 	 	in	Venezuela	,	giving	these	 audience 	 s 	 	a	 mess 	 age 	 	of	music	,	 vital 	 ity 	 	,	energy	,	 ent 	 husiasm 	 	and	strength	.
In	 it 	 s 	 	 es 	 s 	 ence 	 	,	the	orchestra	and	the	choir	are	much	more	than	 art 	 istic 	 	 structure 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	are	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	and	 school 	 s 	 	of	social	life	,	 be 	 cause 	 	to	 s 	 ing 	 	and	to	play	together	 mean 	 s 	 	to	 intima 	 te 	 ly 	 	 co 	 exist 	 	 to 	 ward 	 	 perfect 	 ion 	 	and	excellence	,	 follow 	 ing 	 	a	strict	discipline	of	 organ 	 ization 	 	and	 coordi 	 nation 	 	in	order	to	seek	the	 harmon 	 ic 	 	 inter 	 depend 	 ence 	 	of	 voice 	 s 	 	and	 instrument 	 s 	 	.
That	's	how	they	build	a	spirit	of	 solid 	 arity 	 	and	 fratern 	 ity 	 	among	them	,	develop	 the 	 ir 	 	 self 	 - 	 esteem 	 	and	foster	the	 ethic 	 al 	 	and	 aesthetic 	 al 	 	 value 	 s 	 	related	to	the	music	in	all	 it 	 s 	 	 sense 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	why	music	is	 immense 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	in	the	 awake 	 ning 	 	of	 sens 	 ibility 	 	,	in	the	 for 	 ging 	 	of	 value 	 s 	 	and	in	the	training	of	 young 	 sters 	 	to	teach	other	 kid 	 s 	 	.
Child	:	After	all	 th 	 is 	 	time	here	,	music	is	life	.
 No 	 thing 	 	else	.
Music	is	life	.
 J 	 A 	 	:	 E 	 ach 	 	teenager	and	child	in	El	Sistema	 ha 	 s 	 	his	own	story	,	and	they	are	all	 import 	 ant 	 	and	of	great	 sign 	 ific 	 ance 	 	to	me	.

With	his	effort	,	and	the	support	of	his	mother	,	his	family	and	his	community	,	he	 be 	 came 	 	a	principal	member	in	the	double	 bas 	 s 	 	segment	of	the	 Ber 	 lin 	 	 Phil 	 harmon 	 ic 	 	Orchestra	.
We	have	 an 	 other 	 	 well 	 - 	 known 	 	case	--	 Gus 	 ta 	 vo 	 	Dudamel	.
He	 start 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	boy	member	of	the	children	's	orchestra	in	his	 home 	 town 	 	,	 Bar 	 qui 	 simeto 	 	.
There	,	he	grew	 a 	 s 	 	a	 viol 	 in 	 ist 	 	and	 a 	 s 	 	a	conductor	.
He	 be 	 came 	 	the	conductor	of	Venezuela	's	 juni 	 or 	 	 orchestra 	 s 	 	,	and	 to 	 day 	 	 conduct 	 s 	 	the	world	's	 great 	 est 	 	 orchestra 	 s 	 	.
He	is	the	musical	director	of	 Lo 	 s 	 	 Angel 	 es 	 	 Phil 	 harmon 	 ic 	 	,	and	is	still	the	 over 	 all 	 	 lead 	 er 	 	of	Venezuela	's	 juni 	 or 	 	 orchestra 	 s 	 	.
He	was	the	conductor	of	the	 Go 	 then 	 burg 	 	 Sym 	 phony 	 	Orchestra	,	and	he	's	an	 un 	 beat 	 able 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	for	young	 music 	 ians 	 	in	 Lat 	 in 	 	America	and	the	world	.
The	structure	of	El	Sistema	is	based	on	a	new	and	 flex 	 ible 	 	 man 	 aging 	 	style	 adapt 	 ed 	 	to	the	 feature 	 s 	 	of	each	community	and	region	,	and	 to 	 day 	 	 attend 	 s 	 	to	300,000	children	of	the	lower	and	middle	class	all	over	Venezuela	.
It	's	a	program	of	social	 rescu 	 e 	 	and	deep	cultural	 transform 	 ation 	 	designed	for	the	whole	 Venezuela 	 n 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	with	 absolute 	 ly 	 	no	 distinct 	 ions 	 	 what 	 so 	 ever 	 	,	but	 emphas 	 izing 	 	the	 vulner 	 able 	 	and	 en 	 danger 	 ed 	 	social	 group 	 s 	 	.
The	effect	of	El	Sistema	is	felt	in	three	fundamental	 circle 	 s 	 	:	in	the	 personal 	 / 	 social 	 	circle	,	in	the	family	circle	and	in	the	community	.
In	the	 personal 	 / 	 social 	 	circle	,	the	children	in	the	 orchestra 	 s 	 	and	 choir 	 s 	 	develop	 the 	 ir 	 	intellectual	and	 emotion 	 al 	 	side	.
The	music	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	source	for	 develop 	 ing 	 	the	 dimension 	 s 	 	of	the	human	 be 	 ing 	 	,	thus	 elev 	 ating 	 	the	spirit	and	 lead 	 ing 	 	man	to	a	full	 develop 	 ment 	 	of	his	 personal 	 ity 	 	.
So	,	the	 emotion 	 al 	 	and	intellectual	 profit 	 s 	 	are	huge	--	the	 acquisit 	 ion 	 	of	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	,	 teach 	 ing 	 	and	training	 principle 	 s 	 	,	the	sense	of	 commit 	 ment 	 	,	 respons 	 ibility 	 	,	 gene 	 ros 	 ity 	 	and	 d 	 ed 	 ic 	 ation 	 	to	 other 	 s 	 	,	and	the	individual	 con 	 trib 	 ution 	 	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	great	 collect 	 ive 	 	 goal 	 s 	 	.
All	 th 	 is 	 	 lead 	 s 	 	to	the	 develop 	 ment 	 	of	 self 	 - 	 esteem 	 	and	confidence	.
Mother	Teresa	of	 Cal 	 cut 	 ta 	 	 insist 	 ed 	 	on	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 al 	 ways 	 	 impress 	 ed 	 	me	:	the	most	 mis 	 er 	 able 	 	and	tragic	thing	about	poverty	is	not	the	lack	of	bread	or	roof	,	but	the	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 no 	 - 	 one 	 	--	the	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	not	 be 	 ing 	 	 any 	 one 	 	,	the	lack	of	 ident 	 ification 	 	,	the	lack	of	public	esteem	.
That	's	why	the	child	's	 develop 	 ment 	 	in	the	orchestra	and	the	choir	 provide 	 s 	 	him	with	a	noble	 ident 	 ity 	 	and	 make 	 s 	 	him	a	role	model	for	his	family	and	community	.
It	 make 	 s 	 	him	a	better	student	at	school	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 inspire 	 s 	 	in	him	a	sense	of	 respons 	 ibility 	 	,	 persever 	 ance 	 	and	 punctu 	 ality 	 	that	will	 great 	 ly 	 	help	him	at	school	.
 With 	 in 	 	the	family	,	the	 parent 	 s 	 	'	support	is	 un 	 condition 	 al 	 	.
The	child	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	role	model	for	both	his	 parent 	 s 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	for	a	poor	child	.
 O 	 nce 	 	the	child	 discover 	 s 	 	he	is	 import 	 ant 	 	to	his	family	,	he	 begin 	 s 	 	to	seek	new	ways	of	 improv 	 ing 	 	 him 	 self 	 	and	 hope 	 s 	 	better	for	 him 	 self 	 	and	his	community	.
 Al 	 so 	 	,	he	 hope 	 s 	 	for	social	and	economic	 improve 	 ments 	 	for	his	own	family	.
All	 th 	 is 	 	 make 	 s 	 	up	a	 construct 	 ive 	 	and	 ascend 	 ing 	 	social	dynamic	.
The	large	 major 	 ity 	 	of	our	children	belong	,	 a 	 s 	 	I	 al 	 ready 	 	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	,	to	the	most	 vulner 	 able 	 	 strat 	 a 	 	of	the	 Venezuela 	 n 	 	population	.
That	 encourag 	 es 	 	them	to	embrace	new	 dream 	 s 	 	,	new	 goal 	 s 	 	,	and	progress	in	the	 vari 	 ous 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	that	music	 ha 	 s 	 	to	 off 	 er 	 	.
 Fin 	 ally 	 	,	in	the	circle	of	the	community	,	the	 orchestra 	 s 	 	prove	to	be	the	creative	 space 	 s 	 	of	culture	and	 source 	 s 	 	of	 ex 	 change 	 	and	new	 meaning 	 s 	 	.
The	 spontane 	 ity 	 	music	 ha 	 s 	 	 exclude 	 s 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	 luxur 	 y 	 	item	and	 make 	 s 	 	it	a	 pa 	 trim 	 ony 	 	of	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
It	's	what	 make 	 s 	 	a	child	play	a	 viol 	 in 	 	at	home	,	while	his	father	 work 	 s 	 	in	his	 carp 	 entry 	 	.
It	's	what	 make 	 s 	 	a	little	girl	play	the	 clar 	 inet 	 	at	home	,	while	her	mother	 do 	 es 	 	the	 house 	 work 	 	.
The	idea	is	that	the	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	join	with	 pri 	 de 	 	and	joy	in	the	 activ 	 ities 	 	of	the	 orchestra 	 s 	 	and	the	 choir 	 s 	 	that	 the 	 ir 	 	children	belong	to	.
The	huge	spiritual	world	that	music	 produce 	 s 	 	in	 it 	 self 	 	,	which	 al 	 so 	 	lies	 with 	 in 	 	 it 	 self 	 	,	 end 	 s 	 	up	 over 	 coming 	 	material	poverty	.
From	the	minute	a	child	's	taught	how	to	play	an	instrument	,	he	's	no	 long 	 er 	 	poor	.
He	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	child	in	progress	 head 	 ing 	 	for	a	professional	level	,	who	'll	 lat 	 er 	 	 be 	 come 	 	a	full	citizen	.
 Needle 	 s 	 s 	 	to	say	that	music	is	the	number	one	 prevent 	 ion 	 	against	 pro 	 stit 	 ution 	 	,	violence	,	bad	 habit 	 s 	 	,	and	 every 	 thing 	 	 de 	 grad 	 ing 	 	in	the	life	of	a	child	.
A	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	historian	 Arno 	 ld 	 	 Toy 	 n 	 bee 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	that	the	world	was	 suffer 	 ing 	 	a	huge	spiritual	crisis	.
Not	an	economic	or	social	crisis	,	but	a	spiritual	one	.
I	 believ 	 e 	 	that	to	confront	 s 	 uch 	 	a	crisis	,	 on 	 ly 	 	art	and	 relig 	 ion 	 	can	give	proper	 answer 	 s 	 	to	 human 	 ity 	 	,	to	 man 	 kind 	 	's	 deep 	 est 	 	 aspir 	 ations 	 	,	and	to	the	historic	 demand 	 s 	 	of	our	 time 	 s 	 	.

Thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
If	you	think	about	the	phone	--	and	Intel	 ha 	 s 	 	tested	a	lot	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	I	'm	going	to	show	you	,	over	the	last	10	 year 	 s 	 	,	in	about	600	 elder 	 ly 	 	 house 	 hold 	 s 	 	--	300	in	 I 	 re 	 land 	 	,	and	300	in	 Port 	 land 	 	--	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	:	How	do	we	measure	and	monitor	behavior	in	a	 medical 	 ly 	 	 meaning 	 ful 	 	way	?
And	if	you	think	about	the	phone	,	right	,	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	can	use	for	some	 in 	 credible 	 	ways	to	help	people	 actual 	 ly 	 	take	the	right	 medic 	 ation 	 	at	the	right	time	.
We	're	 test 	 ing 	 	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	simple	 sensor 	 - 	 network 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	in	the	home	so	that	any	phone	that	a	senior	is	 al 	 ready 	 	 comfort 	 able 	 	with	can	help	them	deal	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 medic 	 ations 	 	.
And	a	lot	of	what	they	do	is	they	pick	up	the	phone	,	and	it	's	our	system	 whisper 	 ing 	 	to	them	which	pill	they	need	to	take	,	and	they	fake	like	they	're	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	conversation	with	a	friend	.
And	they	're	not	 embarrass 	 ed 	 	by	a	 med 	 s 	 	 c 	 addy 	 	that	's	 ug 	 ly 	 	,	that	 s 	 it 	 s 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	kitchen	table	and	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	I	'm	old	.	I	'm	 f 	 rail 	 	.	''
It	's	 sur 	 rep 	 tit 	 ious 	 	technology	that	's	 help 	 ing 	 	them	do	a	simple	task	of	taking	the	right	pill	at	the	right	time	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	we	 al 	 so 	 	do	some	 pre 	 tty 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	with	these	 phone 	 s 	 	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	that	moment	when	you	answer	the	phone	is	a	cognitive	test	every	time	that	you	do	it	.
Think	about	it	,	all	right	?	I	'm	going	to	answer	the	phone	three	different	 time 	 s 	 	.
``	 Hell 	 o 	 	?	Hey	.	''
All	right	?	That	's	the	first	time	.
``	 Hell 	 o 	 	?	Uh	,	 he 	 y 	 	.	''
``	 Hell 	 o 	 	?	Uh	,	who	?
Oh	,	 he 	 y 	 	.	''
All	right	?	 Ver 	 y 	 	big	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	between	the	way	I	 answer 	 ed 	 	the	phone	the	three	 time 	 s 	 	.
And	 a 	 s 	 	we	monitor	phone	 us 	 age 	 	by	 senior 	 s 	 	over	a	long	period	of	time	,	down	to	the	 tenth 	 s 	 	of	a	 micro 	 second 	 	,	that	 re 	 cognition 	 	moment	of	 whet 	 her 	 	they	can	figure	out	that	person	on	the	other	end	is	a	friend	and	we	start	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	them	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	,	or	they	do	a	lot	of	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	trouble	talk	,	where	they	're	like	,	``	Wait	,	who	is	 th 	 is 	 	?	Oh	.	''	Right	?
 Wait 	 ing 	 	for	that	 re 	 cognition 	 	moment	may	be	the	best	early	 indic 	 ator 	 	of	the	 on 	 set 	 	of	 de 	 ment 	 ia 	 	than	 any 	 thing 	 	that	 show 	 s 	 	up	 clinic 	 ally 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
We	call	these	 behavior 	 al 	 	 marker 	 s 	 	.
There	's	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 other 	 s 	 	.	 I 	 s 	 	the	person	going	to	the	phone	 a 	 s 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	when	it	 ring 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	they	used	to	?
 I 	 s 	 	it	a	 hear 	 ing 	 	problem	or	is	it	a	 physical 	 ity 	 	problem	?
 Ha 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	voice	gotten	more	quiet	?	We	're	 do 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	work	with	people	with	Alzheimer	's	and	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	with	Parkinson	's	,	where	that	quiet	voice	that	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 show 	 s 	 	up	with	Parkinson	's	 patient 	 s 	 	may	be	the	best	early	 indic 	 ator 	 	of	Parkinson	's	five	to	10	 year 	 s 	 	before	it	 show 	 s 	 	up	 clinic 	 ally 	 	.
But	 t 	 hose 	 	subtle	 change 	 s 	 	in	your	voice	over	a	long	period	of	time	are	hard	for	you	or	your	spouse	to	notice	 un 	 til 	 	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	so	 extrem 	 e 	 	and	your	voice	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	so	quiet	.
So	,	 sensor 	 s 	 	are	looking	at	that	kind	of	voice	.
When	you	pick	up	the	phone	,	how	much	 trem 	 or 	 	are	you	 hav 	 ing 	 	,	and	what	is	that	like	,	and	what	is	that	trend	like	over	a	period	of	time	?
 A 	 re 	 	you	 hav 	 ing 	 	more	trouble	 dial 	 ing 	 	the	phone	than	you	used	to	?
 I 	 s 	 	it	a	 dexter 	 ity 	 	problem	?	 I 	 s 	 	it	the	 on 	 set 	 	of	 art 	 hritis 	 	?
 A 	 re 	 	you	using	the	phone	?	 A 	 re 	 	you	 social 	 izing 	 	less	than	you	used	to	?
And	looking	at	that	pattern	.	And	what	 do 	 es 	 	that	decline	in	social	health	mean	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	kind	of	a	vital	sign	of	the	future	?
And	then	 w 	 ow 	 	,	what	a	radical	idea	,	we	--	 ex 	 cept 	 	in	the	 Unit 	 ed 	 	 Stat 	 es 	 	--	might	be	able	to	use	 th 	 is 	 	 new 	 fang 	 led 	 	technology	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	interact	with	a	nurse	or	a	doctor	on	the	other	end	of	the	line	.
 W 	 ow 	 	,	what	a	great	day	that	will	be	once	we	're	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	 t 	 hose 	 	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
So	,	these	are	what	I	would	call	 behavior 	 al 	 	 marker 	 s 	 	.
And	it	's	the	whole	field	that	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	work	on	for	the	last	10	 year 	 s 	 	at	Intel	.
How	do	you	put	simple	 disrupt 	 ive 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	and	the	first	of	five	 phrase 	 s 	 	that	I	'm	going	to	talk	about	in	 th 	 is 	 	talk	?
 Behavior 	 al 	 	 marker 	 s 	 	matter	.
How	do	we	change	behavior	?
How	do	we	measure	 change 	 s 	 	in	behavior	in	a	 meaning 	 ful 	 	way	that	's	going	to	help	us	with	 prevent 	 ion 	 	of	disease	,	early	 on 	 set 	 	of	disease	,	and	 track 	 ing 	 	the	 progress 	 ion 	 	of	disease	over	a	long	period	of	time	?
 N 	 ow 	 	,	why	would	Intel	let	me	 s 	 pend 	 	a	lot	of	time	and	money	,	over	the	last	10	 year 	 s 	 	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	the	 need 	 s 	 	of	 senior 	 s 	 	and	start	 think 	 ing 	 	about	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 behavior 	 al 	 	 marker 	 s 	 	?
 Th 	 is 	 	is	some	of	the	field	work	that	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	.
We	have	now	lived	with	1,000	 elder 	 ly 	 	 house 	 hold 	 s 	 	in	20	 count 	 ries 	 	over	the	last	10	 year 	 s 	 	.
We	 stud 	 y 	 	people	in	 Ro 	 chest 	 er 	 	,	New	York	.
We	go	live	with	them	in	the	winter	 be 	 cause 	 	what	they	do	in	the	winter	,	and	 the 	 ir 	 	access	to	 health 	 care 	 	,	and	how	much	they	 social 	 ize 	 	,	is	 ver 	 y 	 	different	than	in	the	summer	.
If	they	have	a	hip	fracture	we	go	with	them	and	we	 stud 	 y 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	entire	 dis 	 charge 	 	experience	.
If	they	have	a	family	member	who	is	a	key	part	of	 the 	 ir 	 	care	network	,	we	fly	and	 stud 	 y 	 	them	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
So	,	we	 stud 	 y 	 	the	 hol 	 istic 	 	health	experience	of	1,000	 senior 	 s 	 	over	the	last	10	 year 	 s 	 	in	20	different	 count 	 ries 	 	.
Why	is	Intel	 will 	 ing 	 	to	fund	that	?
It	's	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	second	slogan	that	I	want	to	talk	about	.
Ten	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	when	I	 start 	 ed 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 con 	 vince 	 	Intel	to	let	me	go	start	looking	at	 disrupt 	 ive 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	that	could	help	with	 in 	 dependent 	 	living	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	I	 call 	 ed 	 	it	:	``	Y2K	+	10	.	''
You	know	,	back	in	2000	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	all	so	 obsess 	 ed 	 	with	 pay 	 ing 	 	attention	to	the	aging	of	our	 computer 	 s 	 	,	and	 whet 	 her 	 	or	not	they	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	the	tick	of	the	clock	from	1999	to	2000	,	that	we	 mis 	 s 	 ed 	 	a	moment	that	 on 	 ly 	 	 demo 	 graph 	 ers 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 pay 	 ing 	 	attention	to	.
It	was	right	around	New	 Year 	 s 	 	.
And	that	 s 	 witch 	 over 	 	,	when	we	had	the	 large 	 r 	 	number	of	 old 	 er 	 	people	on	the	planet	,	for	the	first	time	than	 young 	 er 	 	people	.
For	the	first	time	in	human	 histo 	 ry 	 	--	and	 bar 	 ring 	 	 alien 	 s 	 	 land 	 ing 	 	or	some	major	other	 pan 	 demic 	 	,	that	's	the	 expect 	 ation 	 	from	 demo 	 graph 	 ers 	 	,	going	forward	.
And	10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	it	 seem 	 ed 	 	like	I	had	a	lot	of	time	to	 con 	 vince 	 	Intel	to	work	on	 th 	 is 	 	.	Right	?
Y2K	+	10	was	coming	,	the	baby	 boom 	 ers 	 	 start 	 ing 	 	to	retire	.
Well	 folk 	 s 	 	,	it	's	like	we	know	these	 demo 	 graphic 	 s 	 	here	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	map	of	the	entire	world	.
It	's	like	the	 light 	 s 	 	are	on	,	but	 no 	 body 	 	's	home	on	 th 	 is 	 	 demo 	 graphic 	 	Y2K	+	10	problem	.	Right	?
I	mean	we	sort	of	get	it	here	,	but	we	do	n't	get	it	here	,	and	we	're	not	 do 	 ing 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	about	it	.
The	health	reform	bill	is	 large 	 ly 	 	 ignor 	 ing 	 	the	 real 	 ities 	 	of	the	age	wave	that	's	coming	,	and	the	 implic 	 ations 	 	for	what	we	need	to	do	to	change	not	 on 	 ly 	 	how	we	pay	for	care	,	but	deliver	care	in	some	 radical 	 ly 	 	different	ways	.
And	in	fact	,	it	's	 up 	 on 	 	us	.
I	mean	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	saw	these	 head 	 lines 	 	.	 Th 	 is 	 	is	 Ca 	 ther 	 ine 	 	 Case 	 y 	 	who	is	the	first	 boom 	 er 	 	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	get	 So 	 cial 	 	 Secur 	 ity 	 	.
That	 actual 	 ly 	 	 occur 	 red 	 	 th 	 is 	 	year	.	She	took	early	 retire 	 ment 	 	.
She	was	born	one	second	after	 mid 	 night 	 	in	1946	.
A	 retire 	 d 	 	school	teacher	,	there	she	is	with	a	 So 	 cial 	 	 Secur 	 ity 	 	 administr 	 ator 	 	.
The	first	 boom 	 er 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	we	did	n't	even	wait	till	2011	,	next	year	.
We	're	 al 	 ready 	 	 start 	 ing 	 	to	see	early	 retire 	 ment 	 	occur	 th 	 is 	 	year	.
All	right	,	so	it	's	here	.	 Th 	 is 	 	Y2K	+	10	problem	is	at	our	door	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	50	 tsunami 	 s 	 	 schedule 	 d 	 	on	the	calendar	,	but	 some 	 how 	 	we	ca	n't	sort	of	 marsh 	 al 	 	our	government	and	 innov 	 ative 	 	 force 	 s 	 	to	sort	of	get	out	in	front	of	it	and	do	 some 	 thing 	 	about	it	.	We	'll	wait	 un 	 til 	 	it	's	more	of	a	 catastroph 	 e 	 	,	and	react	,	 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	 prep 	 are 	 	for	it	.
So	,	one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	it	's	so	 challeng 	 ing 	 	to	 prep 	 are 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	Y2K	problem	is	,	I	want	to	 argu 	 e 	 	,	we	have	what	I	would	call	 main 	 frame 	 	 poison 	 ing 	 	.
 And 	 y 	 	Grove	,	about	six	or	seven	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	even	know	or	remember	 th 	 is 	 	,	in	a	 For 	 tune 	 	Magazine	article	he	used	the	phrase	``	 main 	 frame 	 	 health 	 care 	 	,	''	and	I	've	 be 	 en 	 	 extend 	 ing 	 	and	 expand 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
He	saw	it	written	down	 some 	 where 	 	.	He	's	like	,	``	 Er 	 ic 	 	that	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	 con 	 cept 	 	.	''
I	was	like	,	``	 Actu 	 ally 	 	it	was	your	idea	.	You	 s 	 aid 	 	it	in	a	 For 	 tune 	 	Magazine	article	.
I	just	 extend 	 ed 	 	it	.	''
You	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 main 	 frame 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 ment 	 ality 	 	of	 travel 	 ing 	 	to	and	 time 	 sharing 	 	large	,	expensive	 health 	 care 	 	 system 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	in	1787	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	general	hospital	in	 Vie 	 nna 	 	.
And	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	second	general	hospital	in	 Vie 	 nna 	 	,	in	about	1850	,	was	where	we	 start 	 ed 	 	to	build	out	an	entire	curriculum	for	 teach 	 ing 	 	med	 student 	 s 	 	 special 	 ties 	 	.
And	it	's	a	place	in	which	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 develop 	 ing 	 	 architect 	 ure 	 	that	 liter 	 ally 	 	 divid 	 ed 	 	the	body	,	and	 divid 	 ed 	 	care	 in 	 to 	 	 depart 	 ments 	 	and	 compartment 	 s 	 	.
And	it	was	 reflect 	 ed 	 	in	our	 architect 	 ure 	 	,	it	was	 reflect 	 ed 	 	in	the	way	that	we	taught	 student 	 s 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 main 	 frame 	 	 ment 	 ality 	 	 persist 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	I	'm	not	 anti 	 - 	 hospital 	 	.
With	my	own	 health 	 care 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	,	I	've	taken	drug	 ther 	 a 	 pies 	 	,	I	've	 travel 	 ed 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	hospital	and	 other 	 s 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	.
But	we	worship	the	high	hospital	on	a	hill	.	Right	?
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	 main 	 frame 	 	 health 	 care 	 	.
And	just	 a 	 s 	 	30	 year 	 s 	 	ago	we	could	n't	 conceiv 	 e 	 	that	we	would	have	the	power	of	a	 main 	 frame 	 	computer	that	took	up	a	room	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 ize 	 	in	our	 pur 	 s 	 es 	 	and	on	our	 belt 	 s 	 	,	that	we	're	 carry 	 ing 	 	around	in	our	cell	phone	 to 	 day 	 	,	and	 sudden 	 ly 	 	,	computing	,	that	used	to	be	an	expert	driven	system	,	it	was	a	personal	system	that	we	all	owned	 a 	 s 	 	part	of	our	 dai 	 ly 	 	 live 	 s 	 	--	that	shift	from	 main 	 frame 	 	to	personal	computing	is	what	we	have	to	do	for	 health 	 care 	 	.
We	have	to	shift	from	 th 	 is 	 	 main 	 frame 	 	 ment 	 ality 	 	of	 health 	 care 	 	to	a	personal	model	of	 health 	 care 	 	.
We	are	 obsess 	 ed 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	way	of	 think 	 ing 	 	.
When	Intel	 do 	 es 	 	 survey 	 s 	 	all	around	the	world	and	we	say	,	``	 Qui 	 ck 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	:	 health 	 care 	 	.	''
The	first	word	that	 come 	 s 	 	up	is	``	doctor	.	''
The	second	that	 come 	 s 	 	up	is	``	hospital	.	''	And	the	third	is	``	 ill 	 ness 	 	''	or	``	 sick 	 ness 	 	.	''	Right	?
We	are	wired	,	in	our	 imagin 	 ation 	 	,	to	think	about	 health 	 care 	 	and	 health 	 care 	 	 innov 	 ation 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 go 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	that	place	.
Our	entire	health	reform	 discuss 	 ion 	 	right	now	,	health	 I. 	 T. 	 	,	when	we	talk	with	policy	makers	,	 equal 	 s 	 	``	How	are	we	going	to	get	 doctor 	 s 	 	using	 electron 	 ic 	 	medical	 record 	 s 	 	in	the	 main 	 frame 	 	?	''
We	're	not	 think 	 ing 	 	about	how	do	we	shift	from	the	 main 	 frame 	 	to	the	home	.
And	the	problem	with	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	way	we	 conceiv 	 e 	 	 health 	 care 	 	.	Right	?
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 re 	 active 	 	,	 crisis 	 - 	 driven 	 	system	.
We	're	 do 	 ing 	 	15-minute	 ex 	 am 	 s 	 	with	 patient 	 s 	 	.
It	's	 population 	 - 	 based 	 	.
We	collect	a	bunch	of	 bio 	 logical 	 	information	in	 th 	 is 	 	artificial	setting	,	and	we	fix	them	up	,	like	 Humpty 	 - 	 Dumpty 	 	all	over	 aga 	 in 	 	,	and	 s 	 end 	 	them	home	,	and	hope	--	we	might	hand	them	a	brochure	,	 may 	 be 	 	an	 inter 	 active 	 	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	--	that	they	do	 a 	 s 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	and	do	n't	come	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	 main 	 frame 	 	.
And	the	problem	is	we	ca	n't	afford	it	 to 	 day 	 	,	 folk 	 s 	 	.
We	ca	n't	afford	 main 	 frame 	 	 health 	 care 	 	 to 	 day 	 	to	include	the	 un 	 insur 	 ed 	 	.
And	now	we	want	to	do	a	 double 	 - 	 double 	 	of	the	age	wave	coming	through	?
 Bu 	 s 	 iness 	 	 a 	 s 	 	usual	in	 health 	 care 	 	is	broken	and	we	've	got	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	different	.
We	've	got	to	focus	on	the	home	.
We	've	got	to	focus	on	a	personal	 health 	 care 	 	paradigm	that	 move 	 s 	 	care	to	the	home	.	How	do	we	be	more	 pro 	 active 	 	,	prevention-driven	?
How	do	we	collect	vital	 sign 	 s 	 	and	other	 kind 	 s 	 	of	information	24	by	7	?
How	do	we	get	a	personal	 base 	 line 	 	about	what	's	going	to	work	for	you	?
How	do	we	collect	not	just	 bio 	 logical 	 	data	but	 behavior 	 al 	 	data	,	 psycho 	 logical 	 	data	,	 relation 	 al 	 	data	,	in	and	on	and	around	the	home	?
And	how	do	we	drive	compliance	to	be	a	 custom 	 ized 	 	care	plan	that	uses	all	 th 	 is 	 	great	technology	that	's	around	us	to	change	our	behavior	?
That	's	what	we	need	to	do	for	our	personal	health	model	.
I	want	to	give	you	a	couple	of	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.	 Th 	 is 	 	is	 Mi 	 mi 	 	from	one	of	our	 stud 	 ies 	 	--	in	her	90s	,	had	to	move	out	of	her	home	 be 	 cause 	 	her	family	was	 worri 	 ed 	 	about	 fall 	 s 	 	.

 Class 	 ic 	 	.	Hip	fracture	often	 lead 	 s 	 	to	 institution 	 al 	 ization 	 	of	a	senior	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	what	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	to	 Mi 	 mi 	 	;	the	family	was	 worri 	 ed 	 	about	it	,	 move 	 d 	 	her	out	of	her	own	home	 in 	 to 	 	an	 assist 	 ed 	 	living	 facil 	 ity 	 	.
She	 trip 	 ped 	 	over	her	oxygen	tank	.
 Man 	 y 	 	people	in	 th 	 is 	 	generation	wo	n't	press	the	button	,	even	if	they	have	an	alert	call	system	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	do	n't	want	to	 both 	 er 	 	 any 	 body 	 	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	 pay 	 ing 	 	30	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	month	.
 Boom 	 ers 	 	will	press	the	button	.	Trust	me	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	going	to	be	 press 	 ing 	 	that	button	 non 	 - 	 stop 	 	.	Right	?
 Mi 	 mi 	 	broke	her	 pel 	 vis 	 	,	lay	all	night	,	all	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	 final 	 ly 	 	 some 	 body 	 	came	in	and	found	her	,	 s 	 ent 	 	her	to	the	hospital	.
 The 	 y 	 	 fix 	 ed 	 	her	back	up	.	She	was	never	going	to	be	able	to	move	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	 assist 	 ed 	 	living	.	 The 	 y 	 	put	her	 in 	 to 	 	the	 nurs 	 ing 	 	home	unit	.

 N 	 ow 	 	,	the	most	 frighten 	 ing 	 	thing	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	wife	's	 grand 	 mother 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	I	'm	 Er 	 ic 	 	 Dis 	 hman 	 	.	I	speak	English	,	I	work	for	Intel	,	I	make	a	good	 s 	 al 	 ary 	 	,	I	'm	smart	about	 fall 	 s 	 	and	 fall 	 - 	 related 	 	 inju 	 ries 	 	--	it	's	an	area	of	research	that	I	work	on	.
I	have	access	to	 senator 	 s 	 	and	 CEO 	 s 	 	.
I	ca	n't	stop	 th 	 is 	 	from	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
What	 happen 	 s 	 	if	you	do	n't	have	money	,	you	do	n't	speak	English	or	do	n't	have	the	kind	of	access	to	deal	with	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 problem 	 s 	 	that	 inevit 	 ably 	 	occur	?
How	do	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	prevent	the	vast	 major 	 ity 	 	of	 fall 	 s 	 	from	ever	 occur 	 ring 	 	in	the	first	place	?
Let	me	give	you	a	quick	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	work	that	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	to	try	to	do	 exact 	 ly 	 	that	.
I	've	 be 	 en 	 	 wear 	 ing 	 	a	little	technology	that	we	call	 Shi 	 mmer 	 	.
It	's	a	research	platform	.
It	 ha 	 s 	 	 accele 	 ro 	 metry 	 	.	You	can	plug	in	a	 three 	 - 	 lead 	 	ECG	.
There	is	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	sort	of	 plug 	 - 	 and 	 - 	 play 	 	kind	of	 Lego 	 s 	 	that	you	can	do	to	capture	,	in	the	wild	,	in	the	real	world	,	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 trem 	 or 	 	,	 ga 	 it 	 	,	 strid 	 e 	 	length	and	 t 	 hose 	 	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
The	problem	is	,	our	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	 fall 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	like	 Mi 	 mi 	 	,	is	get	a	survey	in	the	mail	three	 month 	 s 	 	after	you	fell	,	from	the	 Stat 	 e 	 	,	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	What	 we 	 re 	 	you	 do 	 ing 	 	when	you	fell	?	''
That	's	sort	of	the	state	of	the	art	.
But	with	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 Shi 	 mmer 	 	,	or	we	have	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 Mag 	 ic 	 	 Car 	 pet 	 	,	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	 sensor 	 s 	 	in	carpet	,	or	 camera 	 - 	 based 	 	 system 	 s 	 	that	we	 borrow 	 ed 	 	from	 s 	 port 	 s 	 	medicine	,	we	're	 start 	 ing 	 	for	the	first	time	in	 t 	 hose 	 	600	 elder 	 ly 	 	 house 	 hold 	 s 	 	to	collect	actual	kinematic	motion	data	to	understand	:	What	are	the	subtle	 change 	 s 	 	that	are	 occur 	 ring 	 	that	can	show	us	that	mom	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	risk	at	 fall 	 s 	 	?
And	most	often	we	can	do	two	 intervention 	 s 	 	,	fix	the	 med 	 s 	 	mix	.
I	'm	a	 qual 	 itative 	 	 research 	 er 	 	,	but	when	I	look	at	these	data	 stream 	 s 	 	coming	in	from	these	 home 	 s 	 	,	I	can	look	at	the	data	and	tell	you	the	day	that	some	doctor	 pre 	 scribed 	 	them	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 no 	 body 	 	else	 k 	 new 	 	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	on	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	see	the	 change 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	in	the	 house 	 hold 	 	.	Right	?
 Th 	 ese 	 	 discover 	 ies 	 	of	 behavior 	 al 	 	 marker 	 s 	 	,	and	 behavior 	 al 	 	 change 	 s 	 	are	game	changing	,	and	like	the	 discover 	 y 	 	of	the	 micro 	 scope 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	our	 collect 	 ing 	 	data	 stream 	 s 	 	that	we	've	 actual 	 ly 	 	never	 d 	 one 	 	before	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	in	our	 TR 	 IL 	 	Clinic	in	 I 	 re 	 land 	 	of	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	what	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	is	she	's	looking	at	data	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	picture	,	from	the	 Mag 	 ic 	 	 Car 	 pet 	 	.
So	,	we	have	a	little	carpet	that	you	can	look	at	your	amount	of	 post 	 ural 	 	 s 	 way 	 	,	and	look	at	the	 change 	 s 	 	in	your	 post 	 ural 	 	 s 	 way 	 	over	 man 	 y 	 	 month 	 s 	 	.
 He 	 re 	 	's	what	some	of	 th 	 is 	 	data	might	look	like	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	sensor	 fir 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	two	different	 subject 	 s 	 	in	our	 stud 	 y 	 	.
It	's	about	a	year	's	worth	of	data	.
The	color	 represent 	 s 	 	different	rooms	they	are	in	the	house	.
 Th 	 is 	 	person	on	the	left	is	living	in	 the 	 ir 	 	own	home	.
 Th 	 is 	 	person	on	the	right	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	living	in	an	 assist 	 ed 	 	living	 facil 	 ity 	 	.
I	know	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	look	at	how	 punctu 	 ated 	 	meal	time	is	when	they	are	no	 long 	 er 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	rooms	here	.	Right	?
 N 	 ow 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	that	much	to	you	.
But	when	we	look	at	these	 cycle 	 s 	 	of	data	over	a	 long 	 er 	 	period	of	time	--	and	we	're	looking	at	 every 	 thing 	 	from	motion	around	different	rooms	in	the	house	,	to	sort	of	 micro 	 - 	 motion 	 s 	 	that	 Shi 	 mmer 	 	 pick 	 s 	 	up	,	about	 ga 	 it 	 	and	 strid 	 e 	 	length	--	these	 stream 	 s 	 	of	data	are	 start 	 ing 	 	to	tell	us	 thing 	 s 	 	about	 behavior 	 al 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	that	we	've	never	 under 	 stood 	 	before	.
You	can	go	to	 O 	 RCA 	 Tech 	 .org 	 	--	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	 whale 	 s 	 	,	it	's	the	Oregon	 Cent 	 er 	 	for	 A 	 ging 	 	and	 Techno 	 logy 	 	--	to	see	more	about	that	.
The	problem	is	,	Intel	is	still	one	of	the	largest	 fund 	 ers 	 	in	the	world	of	 in 	 dependent 	 	living	technology	research	.
I	'm	not	 brag 	 ging 	 	about	how	much	we	fund	;	it	's	how	little	 any 	 one 	 	else	 actual 	 ly 	 	 pay 	 s 	 	attention	to	aging	and	 fund 	 s 	 	 innov 	 ation 	 	on	aging	,	chronic	disease	management	and	 in 	 dependent 	 	living	in	the	home	.
So	,	my	 man 	 tra 	 	here	,	my	fourth	slogan	is	:	10,000	 house 	 hold 	 s 	 	or	bust	.
We	need	to	drive	a	national	,	if	not	 inter 	 national 	 	,	 Framingham 	 - 	 type 	 	heart	 stud 	 y 	 	of	 in 	 dependent 	 	living	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	where	we	have	10,000	 elder 	 ly 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	 house 	 hold 	 s 	 	with	 broad 	 band 	 	,	full	medical	 character 	 ization 	 	,	and	a	platform	by	which	we	can	start	to	experiment	and	turn	these	from	20-household	anecdotal	 stud 	 ies 	 	that	the	 un 	 ive 	 rs 	 ities 	 	fund	,	to	large	 clinic 	 al 	 	 trial 	 s 	 	that	prove	out	the	value	of	these	 techno 	 logies 	 	.
So	,	10,000	 house 	 hold 	 s 	 	or	bust	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	just	some	of	the	 house 	 hold 	 s 	 	that	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	in	the	Intel	 stud 	 ies 	 	.
My	fifth	and	final	phrase	:	I	have	 tri 	 ed 	 	for	two	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	there	 we 	 re 	 	 moment 	 s 	 	when	we	 we 	 re 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	close	,	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	 health 	 care 	 	reform	bill	be	about	reform	from	 some 	 thing 	 	and	to	 some 	 thing 	 	,	from	a	 main 	 frame 	 	model	to	a	personal	health	model	,	or	to	mean	 some 	 thing 	 	more	than	just	a	debate	about	the	public	option	and	how	we	're	going	to	finance	.
It	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	how	we	finance	 health 	 care 	 	.
We	're	going	to	figure	 some 	 thing 	 	out	for	the	next	10	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	try	it	.
No	matter	who	 pay 	 s 	 	for	it	,	we	better	start	 do 	 ing 	 	care	in	a	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	different	way	and	 treat 	 ing 	 	the	home	and	the	patient	and	the	family	member	and	the	 care 	 giver 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	part	of	these	 coordinate 	 d 	 	care	 team 	 s 	 	and	using	 disrupt 	 ive 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	that	are	 al 	 ready 	 	here	to	do	care	in	some	 pre 	 tty 	 	fundamental	different	ways	.
The	 p 	 resident 	 	 need 	 s 	 	to	stand	up	and	say	,	at	the	end	of	a	 health 	 care 	 	reform	debate	,	``	Our	goal	 a 	 s 	 	a	country	is	to	move	50	percent	of	care	out	of	 institution 	 s 	 	,	 clinic 	 s 	 	,	 hospital 	 s 	 	and	 nurs 	 ing 	 	 home 	 s 	 	,	to	the	home	,	in	10	 year 	 s 	 	.	''
It	's	 achiev 	 able 	 	.	We	should	do	it	 economic 	 ally 	 	,	we	should	do	it	 moral 	 ly 	 	,	and	we	should	do	it	for	quality	of	life	.
But	there	is	no	goal	 with 	 in 	 	 th 	 is 	 	health	reform	.
It	's	just	a	mess	 to 	 day 	 	.
So	,	you	know	,	that	's	my	last	 mess 	 age 	 	to	you	.
How	do	we	set	a	 going 	 - 	 to 	 - 	 the 	 - 	 moon 	 	goal	of	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	the	Y2K	+10	problem	that	's	coming	?
It	's	not	that	 innov 	 ation 	 	and	technology	is	going	to	be	the	magic	pill	that	 cure 	 s 	 	all	,	but	it	's	going	to	be	part	of	the	solution	.
And	if	we	do	n't	create	a	personal	health	 move 	 ment 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	're	all	 aim 	 ing 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	in	reform	,	then	we	're	going	to	move	 no 	 where 	 	.
So	,	I	hope	you	'll	turn	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	 in 	 to 	 	that	kind	of	 move 	 ment 	 	forward	.
 Thank 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
When	I	was	growing	up	in	 Mon 	 tana 	 	,	I	had	two	 dream 	 s 	 	.
I	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	a	 paleonto 	 logist 	 	,	a	dinosaur	 paleonto 	 logist 	 	,	and	I	 want 	 ed 	 	to	have	a	pet	dinosaur	.
And	so	that	's	what	I	've	 be 	 en 	 	 striv 	 ing 	 	for	all	of	my	life	.
I	was	 ver 	 y 	 	fortunate	early	in	my	 care 	 er 	 	.
I	was	fortunate	in	 find 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
I	was	n't	 ver 	 y 	 	good	at	 read 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
In	fact	,	I	do	n't	read	much	of	 any 	 thing 	 	.
I	am	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 dy 	 s 	 lexic 	 	,	and	so	 read 	 ing 	 	is	the	 hard 	 est 	 	thing	I	do	.
But	 in 	 stead 	 	,	I	go	out	and	I	find	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 en 	 	I	just	pick	 thing 	 s 	 	up	.
I	 bas 	 ically 	 	practice	for	 find 	 ing 	 	money	on	the	street	.
And	I	wander	about	the	 hill 	 s 	 	,	and	I	have	found	a	few	 thing 	 s 	 	.
And	I	have	 be 	 en 	 	fortunate	 en 	 ough 	 	to	find	 thing 	 s 	 	like	the	first	 egg 	 s 	 	in	the	Western	 hemi 	 sphere 	 	and	the	first	baby	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	in	 nest 	 s 	 	,	the	first	dinosaur	 embryo 	 s 	 	and	massive	 accumul 	 ations 	 	of	 bone 	 s 	 	.
And	it	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	be	at	a	time	when	people	 we 	 re 	 	just	 start 	 ing 	 	to	begin	to	 real 	 ize 	 	that	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	n't	the	big	,	stupid	,	green	 reptil 	 es 	 	that	people	had	thought	for	so	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	.
People	 we 	 re 	 	 start 	 ing 	 	to	get	an	idea	that	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	special	.
And	so	,	at	that	time	,	I	was	able	to	make	some	 interest 	 ing 	 	 hypo 	 these 	 s 	 	 a 	 long 	 	with	my	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	.
We	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	say	that	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	--	based	on	the	evidence	we	had	--	that	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	built	 nest 	 s 	 	and	lived	in	 colon 	 ies 	 	and	 car 	 ed 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	young	,	 br 	 ought 	 	food	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 bab 	 ies 	 	and	 travel 	 ed 	 	in	 gig 	 antic 	 	 herd 	 s 	 	.
So	it	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	stuff	.
I	have	gone	on	to	find	more	 thing 	 s 	 	and	discover	that	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	social	.
We	have	found	a	lot	of	evidence	that	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	from	when	they	 we 	 re 	 	 juvenile 	 s 	 	to	when	they	 we 	 re 	 	 adult 	 s 	 	.
The	 appear 	 ance 	 	of	them	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	different	--	which	it	is	in	all	social	 animal 	 s 	 	.
In	social	 group 	 s 	 	of	 animal 	 s 	 	,	the	 juvenile 	 s 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	look	different	than	the	 adult 	 s 	 	.
The	 adult 	 s 	 	can	 recogn 	 ize 	 	the	 juvenile 	 s 	 	;	the	 juvenile 	 s 	 	can	 recogn 	 ize 	 	the	 adult 	 s 	 	.
And	so	we	're	making	a	better	picture	of	what	a	dinosaur	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
And	they	did	n't	just	all	chase	 Jeep 	 s 	 	around	.
But	it	is	that	social	thing	that	I	guess	 attract 	 ed 	 	Michael	 C 	 rich 	 ton 	 	.
And	in	his	book	,	he	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	the	social	 animal 	 s 	 	.
And	then	Steven	Spielberg	,	of	course	,	 depict 	 s 	 	these	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	social	 creature 	 s 	 	.
The	theme	of	 th 	 is 	 	story	is	building	a	dinosaur	,	and	so	we	come	to	that	part	of	``	 Ju 	 ra 	 s 	 s 	 ic 	 	Park	.	''
Michael	 C 	 rich 	 ton 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	was	one	of	the	first	people	to	talk	about	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	back	to	life	.
You	all	know	the	story	,	right	.
I	mean	,	I	 assum 	 e 	 	 every 	 one 	 	here	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 een 	 	``	 Ju 	 ra 	 s 	 s 	 ic 	 	Park	.	''
If	you	want	to	make	a	dinosaur	,	you	go	out	,	you	find	 your 	 self 	 	a	piece	of	 petr 	 ified 	 	tree	 s 	 ap 	 	--	 other 	 wise 	 	known	 a 	 s 	 	 am 	 ber 	 	--	that	 ha 	 s 	 	some	 blood 	 - 	 suck 	 ing 	 	 insect 	 s 	 	in	it	,	good	 one 	 s 	 	,	and	you	get	your	insect	and	you	drill	 in 	 to 	 	it	and	you	suck	out	some	DNA	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 obvious 	 ly 	 	all	 insect 	 s 	 	that	 suck 	 ed 	 	blood	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 day 	 s 	 	 suck 	 ed 	 	dinosaur	DNA	out	.
And	you	take	your	DNA	back	to	the	 labor 	 atory 	 	and	you	clone	it	.
And	I	guess	you	inject	it	 in 	 to 	 	 may 	 be 	 	an	ostrich	egg	,	or	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	,	and	then	you	wait	,	and	,	lo	and	 be 	 hold 	 	,	out	 pop 	 s 	 	a	little	baby	dinosaur	.
And	 every 	 body 	 	's	happy	about	that	.
And	they	're	happy	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	keep	 do 	 ing 	 	it	;	they	just	keep	making	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
And	then	,	then	,	then	,	and	then	...
 Th 	 en 	 	the	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 ing 	 	social	,	act	out	 the 	 ir 	 	 social 	 ness 	 	,	and	they	get	together	,	and	they	 conspi 	 re 	 	.
And	,	of	course	,	that	's	what	 make 	 s 	 	Steven	Spielberg	's	movie	--	 conspi 	 ring 	 	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	chasing	people	around	.
So	I	 assum 	 e 	 	 every 	 body 	 	 know 	 s 	 	that	if	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	had	a	piece	of	 am 	 ber 	 	and	it	had	an	insect	in	it	,	and	you	 drill 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	it	,	and	you	got	 some 	 thing 	 	out	of	that	insect	,	and	you	 clon 	 ed 	 	it	,	and	you	did	it	over	and	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	,	you	'd	have	a	room	full	of	 mosquito 	 es 	 	.
And	 prob 	 ably 	 	a	whole	bunch	of	 tree 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
 N 	 ow 	 	if	you	want	dinosaur	DNA	,	I	say	go	to	the	dinosaur	.
So	that	's	what	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	.
Back	in	1993	when	the	movie	came	out	,	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	had	a	grant	from	the	National	Science	 Found 	 ation 	 	to	attempt	to	 ex 	 tract 	 	DNA	from	a	dinosaur	,	and	we	chose	the	dinosaur	on	the	left	,	a	 Tyrannosaur 	 us 	 	 r 	 ex 	 	,	which	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	nice	specimen	.
And	one	of	my	 form 	 er 	 	 doctor 	 al 	 	 student 	 s 	 	,	 Dr 	 . 	 	 Mar 	 y 	 	 Sch 	 weitzer 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	had	the	 back 	 ground 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	thing	.
And	so	she	 look 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	bone	of	 th 	 is 	 	T.	 r 	 ex 	 	,	one	of	the	 t 	 high 	 	 bone 	 s 	 	,	and	she	 actual 	 ly 	 	found	some	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 structure 	 s 	 	in	there	.
 The 	 y 	 	found	these	red	 circul 	 ar 	 - 	 looking 	 	 object 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 look 	 ed 	 	,	for	all	the	world	,	like	red	blood	 cell 	 s 	 	.
And	they	're	in	what	appear	to	be	the	blood	 channel 	 s 	 	that	go	through	the	bone	.
And	so	she	thought	,	well	,	what	the	heck	.
So	she	 s 	 ampl 	 ed 	 	some	material	out	of	it	.
 N 	 ow 	 	it	was	n't	DNA	;	she	did	n't	find	DNA	.
But	she	did	find	 hem 	 e 	 	,	which	is	the	 bio 	 logical 	 	 found 	 ation 	 	of	hemoglobin	.
And	that	was	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	.
That	was	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
That	was	--	here	we	have	65-million-year-old	 hem 	 e 	 	.
Well	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	and	 tri 	 ed 	 	and	we	could	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	get	 any 	 thing 	 	else	out	of	it	.
So	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	went	by	,	and	then	we	 start 	 ed 	 	the	Hell	 Cre 	 ek 	 	Project	.
And	the	Hell	 Cre 	 ek 	 	Project	was	 th 	 is 	 	massive	 under 	 taking 	 	to	get	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	could	possibly	find	,	and	 hope 	 fully 	 	find	some	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	that	had	more	material	in	them	.
And	out	in	eastern	 Mon 	 tana 	 	there	's	a	lot	of	space	,	a	lot	of	 bad 	 land 	 s 	 	,	and	not	 ver 	 y 	 	 man 	 y 	 	people	,	and	so	you	can	go	out	there	and	find	a	lot	of	stuff	.
And	we	did	find	a	lot	of	stuff	.
We	found	a	lot	of	 Tyrannosaur 	 s 	 	,	but	we	found	one	special	Tyrannosaur	,	and	we	 call 	 ed 	 	it	 B 	 - 	 r 	 ex 	 	.
And	 B 	 - 	 r 	 ex 	 	was	found	under	a	thousand	cubic	 yard 	 s 	 	of	rock	.
It	was	n't	a	 ver 	 y 	 	complete	T.	 r 	 ex 	 	,	and	it	was	n't	a	 ver 	 y 	 	big	T.	 r 	 ex 	 	,	but	it	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	special	 B 	 - 	 r 	 ex 	 	.
And	I	and	my	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	cut	 in 	 to 	 	it	,	and	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	determine	,	by	looking	at	lines	of	 arrest 	 ed 	 	growth	,	some	lines	in	it	,	that	 B 	 - 	 r 	 ex 	 	had	 di 	 ed 	 	at	the	age	of	16	.
We	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	know	how	long	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	lived	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	n't	found	the	 old 	 est 	 	one	yet	.
But	 th 	 is 	 	one	 di 	 ed 	 	at	the	age	of	16	.
We	 g 	 ave 	 	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	to	 Mar 	 y 	 	 Sch 	 weitzer 	 	,	and	she	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	able	to	determine	that	 B 	 - 	 r 	 ex 	 	was	a	female	based	on	 med 	 ull 	 ary 	 	tissue	found	on	the	 in 	 side 	 	of	the	bone	.
 Med 	 ull 	 ary 	 	tissue	is	the	 calc 	 ium 	 	 build 	 - 	 up 	 	,	the	 calc 	 ium 	 	 s 	 to 	 rage 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	when	an	animal	is	 pregn 	 ant 	 	,	when	a	bird	is	 pregn 	 ant 	 	.
So	here	was	the	character	that	linked	 bird 	 s 	 	and	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	.
But	 Mar 	 y 	 	went	further	.
She	took	the	bone	,	and	she	 dump 	 ed 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	acid	.
 N 	 ow 	 	we	all	know	that	 bone 	 s 	 	are	 fossil 	 ized 	 	,	and	so	if	you	dump	it	 in 	 to 	 	acid	,	there	should	n't	be	 any 	 thing 	 	left	.
But	there	was	 some 	 thing 	 	left	.
There	 we 	 re 	 	blood	 vessel 	 s 	 	left	.
There	 we 	 re 	 	 flex 	 ible 	 	,	clear	blood	 vessel 	 s 	 	.
And	so	here	was	the	first	soft	tissue	from	a	dinosaur	.
It	was	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	.
But	she	 al 	 so 	 	found	 osteo 	 cytes 	 	,	which	are	the	 cell 	 s 	 	that	laid	down	the	 bone 	 s 	 	.
And	try	and	try	,	we	could	not	find	DNA	,	but	she	did	find	evidence	of	 protein 	 s 	 	.
But	we	thought	 may 	 be 	 	--	well	,	we	thought	 may 	 be 	 	that	the	material	was	 break 	 ing 	 	down	after	it	was	coming	out	of	the	ground	.
We	thought	 may 	 be 	 	it	was	 deterio 	 rating 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	fast	.
And	so	we	built	a	 labor 	 atory 	 	in	the	back	of	an	18-wheeler	 trail 	 er 	 	,	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	took	the	 labor 	 atory 	 	to	the	field	where	we	could	get	better	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
And	we	did	.	We	got	better	material	.
The	 cell 	 s 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	better	.
The	 vessel 	 s 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	better	.
Found	the	protein	 collage 	 n 	 	.
I	mean	,	it	was	 wonder 	 ful 	 	stuff	.
But	it	's	not	dinosaur	DNA	.
So	we	have	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	dinosaur	DNA	,	and	all	DNA	,	just	 break 	 s 	 	down	too	fast	.
We	're	just	not	going	to	be	able	to	do	what	they	did	in	``	 Ju 	 ra 	 s 	 s 	 ic 	 	Park	.	''
We	're	not	going	to	be	able	to	make	a	dinosaur	based	on	a	dinosaur	.
But	 bird 	 s 	 	are	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	.
 Bird 	 s 	 	are	living	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	.
We	 actual 	 ly 	 	 class 	 ify 	 	them	 a 	 s 	 	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	.
We	now	call	them	 non 	 - 	 av 	 ian 	 	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	and	 av 	 ian 	 	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	.
So	the	 non 	 - 	 av 	 ian 	 	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	are	the	big	 clunk 	 y 	 	 one 	 s 	 	that	went	extinct	.
 Avi 	 an 	 	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	are	our	modern	 bird 	 s 	 	.
So	we	do	n't	have	to	make	a	dinosaur	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 al 	 ready 	 	have	them	.
I	know	,	you	're	 a 	 s 	 	bad	 a 	 s 	 	the	 sixth 	 - 	 graders 	 	.
The	 sixth 	 - 	 graders 	 	look	at	it	and	they	say	,	``	No	.	''
``	You	can	call	it	a	dinosaur	,	but	look	at	the	 velo 	 ciraptor 	 	:	the	 velo 	 ciraptor 	 	is	cool	.	''
``	The	chicken	is	not	.	''
So	 th 	 is 	 	is	our	problem	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	imagine	.
The	chicken	is	a	dinosaur	.
I	mean	it	 re 	 ally 	 	is	.
You	ca	n't	 argu 	 e 	 	with	it	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	the	 class 	 ifier 	 s 	 	and	we	've	 class 	 ified 	 	it	that	way	.
But	the	 sixth 	 - 	 graders 	 	demand	it	.
``	 Fi 	 x 	 	the	chicken	.	''
So	that	's	what	I	'm	here	to	tell	you	about	:	how	we	are	going	to	fix	a	chicken	.
So	we	have	a	number	of	ways	that	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	can	fix	the	chicken	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	evolution	 work 	 s 	 	,	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	some	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	.
We	'll	call	them	 bio 	 logical 	 	 mod 	 ification 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	.
We	have	 s 	 election 	 	.
And	we	know	 s 	 election 	 	 work 	 s 	 	.
We	 start 	 ed 	 	out	with	a	 wolf 	 - 	 like 	 	creature	and	we	 end 	 ed 	 	up	with	a	 Mal 	 tes 	 e 	 	.
I	mean	,	that	's	--	that	's	 definite 	 ly 	 	genetic	 mod 	 ification 	 	.
Or	any	of	the	other	 funny 	 - 	 looking 	 	little	 dog 	 s 	 	.
We	 al 	 so 	 	have	 trans 	 genesis 	 	.
 Trans 	 genesis 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	too	.
That	's	where	you	take	a	gene	out	of	one	animal	and	stick	it	in	 an 	 other 	 	one	.
That	's	how	people	make	 Glo 	 Fish 	 	.
You	take	a	glow	gene	out	of	a	coral	or	a	 jelly 	 fish 	 	and	you	stick	it	in	a	 zebra 	 fish 	 	,	and	,	puff	,	they	glow	.
And	that	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	cool	.
And	they	 obvious 	 ly 	 	make	a	lot	of	money	off	of	them	.
And	now	they	're	making	 Glow 	 - 	 rabbi 	 ts 	 	and	 Glow 	 - 	 all 	 - 	 sort 	 s 	 - 	 of 	 - 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
I	guess	we	could	make	a	glow	chicken	.
But	I	do	n't	think	that	'll	satisfy	the	 sixth 	 - 	 graders 	 	either	.
But	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	thing	.
There	's	what	we	call	atavism	 activ 	 ation 	 	.
And	atavism	 activ 	 ation 	 	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	--	an	atavism	is	an	 ance 	 stral 	 	 character 	 istic 	 	.
You	heard	that	 occasion 	 ally 	 	children	are	born	with	 tail 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	an	 ance 	 stral 	 	 character 	 istic 	 	.
And	so	there	are	a	number	of	 atavism 	 s 	 	that	can	happen	.
 Snake 	 s 	 	are	 occasion 	 ally 	 	born	with	 leg 	 s 	 	.
And	here	's	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	chicken	with	 tee 	 th 	 	.
A	fellow	by	the	name	of	Matthew	 Har 	 ris 	 	at	the	 Univers 	 ity 	 	of	Wisconsin	in	 Mad 	 ison 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	a	way	to	 stimul 	 ate 	 	the	gene	for	 tee 	 th 	 	,	and	so	was	able	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	turn	the	tooth	gene	on	and	produce	 tee 	 th 	 	in	 chicken 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	that	's	a	good	 character 	 istic 	 	.
We	can	 s 	 ave 	 	that	one	.
We	know	we	can	use	that	.
We	can	make	a	chicken	with	 tee 	 th 	 	.
That	's	 get 	 ting 	 	 close 	 r 	 	.
That	's	better	than	a	 glow 	 ing 	 	chicken	.
A	friend	of	mine	,	a	 col 	 league 	 	of	mine	,	 Dr 	 . 	 	 Han 	 s 	 	 Lars 	 son 	 	at	 McG 	 ill 	 	 Univers 	 ity 	 	,	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	looking	at	 atavism 	 s 	 	.
And	he	's	looking	at	them	by	looking	at	the	embryo	genesis	of	 bird 	 s 	 	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	looking	at	how	they	develop	,	and	he	's	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	how	 bird 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	lost	 the 	 ir 	 	tail	.
He	's	 al 	 so 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	the	 transform 	 ation 	 	of	the	arm	,	the	hand	,	to	the	wing	.
He	's	looking	for	 t 	 hose 	 	 gene 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
And	I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Well	,	if	you	can	find	 t 	 hose 	 	,	I	can	just	reverse	them	and	make	what	I	need	to	make	for	the	 sixth 	 - 	 graders 	 	.	''
And	so	he	 agree 	 d 	 	.
And	so	that	's	what	we	're	looking	 in 	 to 	 	.
If	you	look	at	dinosaur	 hand 	 s 	 	,	a	 velo 	 ciraptor 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	that	 cool 	 - 	 looking 	 	hand	with	the	 claw 	 s 	 	on	it	.
 Arch 	 aeopteryx 	 	,	which	is	a	bird	,	a	primitive	bird	,	still	 ha 	 s 	 	that	 ver 	 y 	 	primitive	hand	.
But	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	the	pigeon	,	or	a	chicken	or	 any 	 thing 	 	else	,	 an 	 other 	 	bird	,	 ha 	 s 	 	kind	of	a	 weird 	 - 	 looking 	 	hand	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	hand	is	a	wing	.
But	the	cool	thing	is	that	,	if	you	look	in	the	embryo	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	embryo	is	 develop 	 ing 	 	the	hand	 actual 	 ly 	 	 look 	 s 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	like	the	 arch 	 aeopteryx 	 	hand	.
It	 ha 	 s 	 	the	three	 finger 	 s 	 	,	the	three	 digit 	 s 	 	.
But	a	gene	 turn 	 s 	 	on	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 fuse 	 s 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	together	.
And	so	what	we	're	looking	for	is	that	gene	.
We	want	to	stop	that	gene	from	 turn 	 ing 	 	on	,	fusing	 t 	 hose 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	together	,	so	we	can	get	a	chicken	that	 hatch 	 es 	 	out	with	a	 three 	 - 	 finger 	 ed 	 	hand	,	like	the	 arch 	 aeopteryx 	 	.
And	the	same	 go 	 es 	 	for	the	 tail 	 s 	 	.
 Bird 	 s 	 	have	 bas 	 ically 	 	 rud 	 imentary 	 	 tail 	 s 	 	.
And	so	we	know	that	in	embryo	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	animal	is	 develop 	 ing 	 	,	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 relat 	 ively 	 	long	tail	.
But	a	gene	 turn 	 s 	 	on	and	 resorb 	 s 	 	the	tail	,	 get 	 s 	 	rid	of	it	.
So	that	's	the	other	gene	we	're	looking	for	.
We	want	to	stop	that	tail	from	 resorb 	 ing 	 	.
So	what	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	 re 	 ally 	 	is	take	our	chicken	,	modify	it	and	make	the	 chicken 	 o 	 saurus 	 	.
It	's	a	 cool 	 er 	 - 	 looking 	 	chicken	.
But	it	's	just	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 bas 	 ic 	 s 	 	.
So	that	 re 	 ally 	 	is	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	.
And	people	 al 	 ways 	 	say	,	``	Why	do	that	?
Why	make	 th 	 is 	 	thing	?
What	good	is	it	?	''
Well	,	that	's	a	good	question	.
 Actu 	 ally 	 	,	I	think	it	's	a	great	way	to	teach	 kid 	 s 	 	about	 evolution 	 ary 	 	biology	and	 develop 	 mental 	 	biology	and	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
And	 quit 	 e 	 	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	I	think	if	 Col 	 on 	 el 	 	 Sand 	 ers 	 	was	to	be	 care 	 ful 	 	how	he	 word 	 ed 	 	it	,	he	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	advertise	an	extra	piece	.
 Any 	 way 	 	--	When	our	 d 	 ino 	 - 	 chicken 	 	 hatch 	 es 	 	,	it	will	be	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	the	 post 	 er 	 	child	,	or	what	you	might	call	a	 post 	 er 	 	chick	,	for	technology	,	 entertain 	 ment 	 	and	design	.
Thank	you	.
So	,	 th 	 is 	 	book	that	I	have	in	my	hand	is	a	 director 	 y 	 	of	 every 	 body 	 	who	had	an	email	address	in	1982	.
 Actu 	 ally 	 	,	it	's	 deceptive 	 ly 	 	large	.
There	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	about	20	people	on	each	page	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	the	name	,	address	and	 tele 	 phone 	 	number	of	every	single	person	.
And	,	in	fact	,	 every 	 body 	 	's	 list 	 ed 	 	twice	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 sort 	 ed 	 	once	by	name	and	once	by	email	address	.
 Obvious 	 ly 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	community	.
There	 we 	 re 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	two	other	Dannys	on	the	Internet	then	.
I	 k 	 new 	 	them	both	.
We	did	n't	all	know	each	other	,	but	we	all	kind	of	 trust 	 ed 	 	each	other	,	and	that	 bas 	 ic 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	trust	 permeate 	 d 	 	the	whole	network	,	and	there	was	a	real	sense	that	we	could	depend	on	each	other	to	do	 thing 	 s 	 	.
So	just	to	give	you	an	idea	of	the	level	of	trust	in	 th 	 is 	 	community	,	let	me	tell	you	what	it	was	like	to	register	a	domain	name	in	the	early	 day 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	it	just	so	 happen 	 ed 	 	that	I	got	to	register	the	third	domain	name	on	the	Internet	.
So	I	could	have	 any 	 thing 	 	I	 want 	 ed 	 	other	than	bbn.com	and	symbolics.com	.
So	I	 pick 	 ed 	 	think.com	,	but	then	I	thought	,	you	know	,	there	's	a	lot	of	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 name 	 s 	 	out	there	.
 May 	 be 	 	I	should	register	a	few	extras	just	in	case	.
And	then	I	thought	,	``	 Na 	 h 	 	,	that	would	n't	be	 ver 	 y 	 	nice	.	''
That	attitude	of	 on 	 ly 	 	taking	what	you	need	was	 re 	 ally 	 	what	 every 	 body 	 	had	on	the	network	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 day 	 s 	 	,	and	in	fact	,	it	was	n't	just	the	people	on	the	network	,	but	it	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	kind	of	built	 in 	 to 	 	the	 proto 	 col 	 s 	 	of	the	Internet	 it 	 self 	 	.
So	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	idea	of	I.P.	,	or	Internet	 proto 	 col 	 	,	and	the	way	that	the	--	the	 r 	 out 	 ing 	 	algorithm	that	used	it	,	 we 	 re 	 	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	``	from	each	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	ability	,	to	each	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	need	.	''
And	so	,	if	you	had	some	extra	 band 	 width 	 	,	you	'd	deliver	a	 mess 	 age 	 	for	 some 	 one 	 	.
If	they	had	some	extra	 band 	 width 	 	,	they	would	deliver	a	 mess 	 age 	 	for	you	.
You	'd	kind	of	depend	on	people	to	do	that	,	and	that	was	the	building	block	.
It	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	that	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 commun 	 ist 	 	principle	was	the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	a	system	 develop 	 ed 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	 Col 	 d 	 	War	by	the	 Defe 	 ns 	 e 	 	Department	,	but	it	 obvious 	 ly 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	well	,	and	we	all	saw	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	with	the	Internet	.
It	was	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	.
In	fact	,	it	was	so	 success 	 ful 	 	that	there	's	no	way	that	these	 day 	 s 	 	you	could	make	a	book	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
My	rough	 calcul 	 ation 	 	is	it	would	be	about	25	 mile 	 s 	 	thick	.
But	,	of	course	,	you	could	n't	do	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	do	n't	know	the	 name 	 s 	 	of	all	the	people	with	Internet	or	email	 address 	 es 	 	,	and	even	if	we	did	know	 the 	 ir 	 	 name 	 s 	 	,	I	'm	 pre 	 tty 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	that	they	would	not	want	 the 	 ir 	 	name	,	address	and	 tele 	 phone 	 	number	 publish 	 ed 	 	to	 every 	 one 	 	.
So	the	fact	is	that	there	's	a	lot	of	bad	 guy 	 s 	 	on	the	Internet	these	 day 	 s 	 	,	and	so	we	 deal 	 t 	 	with	that	by	making	secure	subnetworks	,	VPNs	,	little	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	the	Internet	but	are	made	out	of	the	same	building	 block 	 s 	 	,	but	we	're	still	 bas 	 ically 	 	building	it	out	of	 t 	 hose 	 	same	building	 block 	 s 	 	with	 t 	 hose 	 	same	 assumption 	 s 	 	of	trust	.
And	that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	it	's	 vulner 	 able 	 	to	certain	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 mistak 	 es 	 	that	can	happen	,	or	certain	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 de 	 liberate 	 	 attack 	 s 	 	,	but	even	the	 mistak 	 es 	 	can	be	bad	.
So	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	in	all	of	Asia	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	it	was	 im 	 possible 	 	to	get	YouTube	for	a	little	while	 be 	 cause 	 	Pakistan	made	some	 mistak 	 es 	 	in	how	it	was	censoring	YouTube	in	 it 	 s 	 	internal	network	.
 The 	 y 	 	did	n't	intend	to	screw	up	Asia	,	but	they	did	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	way	that	the	 proto 	 col 	 s 	 	work	.
 An 	 other 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	that	may	have	 affect 	 ed 	 	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	in	 th 	 is 	 	audience	is	,	you	may	remember	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	all	the	 plane 	 s 	 	west	of	the	 Miss 	 issippi 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 ground 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	a	single	 r 	 out 	 ing 	 	card	in	 Sal 	 t 	 	Lake	City	had	a	bug	in	it	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	you	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	think	that	our	 air 	 plane 	 	system	 depend 	 s 	 	on	the	Internet	,	and	in	some	sense	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	.
I	'll	come	back	to	that	 lat 	 er 	 	.
But	the	fact	is	that	people	could	n't	take	off	 be 	 cause 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	was	going	wrong	on	the	Internet	,	and	the	 route 	 r 	 	card	was	down	.
And	so	,	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	start	to	happen	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	there	was	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	thing	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	last	April	.
All	of	a	sudden	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	large	 percent 	 age 	 	of	the	traffic	on	the	whole	Internet	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	the	traffic	between	U.S.	 militar 	 y 	 	 install 	 ations 	 	,	 start 	 ed 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	re-routed	through	China	.
So	for	a	few	 hour 	 s 	 	,	it	all	 pass 	 ed 	 	through	China	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	China	Telecom	 say 	 s 	 	it	was	just	an	honest	 mistak 	 e 	 	,	and	it	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	possible	that	it	was	,	the	way	 thing 	 s 	 	work	,	but	 certain 	 ly 	 	 some 	 body 	 	could	make	a	 dis 	 honest 	 	 mistak 	 e 	 	of	that	sort	if	they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	,	and	it	 show 	 s 	 	you	how	 vulner 	 able 	 	the	system	is	even	to	 mistak 	 es 	 	.
 Imagin 	 e 	 	how	 vulner 	 able 	 	the	system	is	to	 de 	 liberate 	 	 attack 	 s 	 	.
So	if	 some 	 body 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	attack	the	 Unit 	 ed 	 	 Stat 	 es 	 	or	Western	 civil 	 ization 	 	these	 day 	 s 	 	,	they	're	not	going	to	do	it	with	 tank 	 s 	 	.
That	will	not	succeed	.
What	they	'll	 prob 	 ably 	 	do	is	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	like	the	attack	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	on	the	Iranian	nuclear	 facil 	 ity 	 	.
 No 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 claim 	 ed 	 	credit	for	that	.
There	was	 bas 	 ically 	 	a	 factor 	 y 	 	of	industrial	 machine 	 s 	 	.
It	did	n't	think	of	 it 	 self 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	on	the	Internet	.
It	thought	of	 it 	 self 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 dis 	 connect 	 ed 	 	from	the	Internet	,	but	it	was	possible	for	 some 	 body 	 	to	smuggle	a	 US 	 B 	 	drive	in	there	,	or	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	,	and	 soft 	 ware 	 	got	in	there	that	 cause 	 s 	 	the	centrifuges	,	in	that	case	,	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	destroy	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	that	same	kind	of	 soft 	 ware 	 	could	destroy	an	oil	 refine 	 ry 	 	or	a	pharmaceutical	 factor 	 y 	 	or	a	 semi 	 conductor 	 	plant	.
And	so	there	's	a	lot	of	--	I	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	you	've	read	a	lot	in	 paper 	 s 	 	,	about	 worri 	 es 	 	about	cyber	 attack 	 s 	 	and	 defense 	 s 	 	against	 t 	 hose 	 	.
But	the	fact	is	,	people	are	 most 	 ly 	 	focused	on	 defend 	 ing 	 	the	 computer 	 s 	 	on	the	Internet	,	and	there	's	 be 	 en 	 	 surprising 	 ly 	 	little	attention	to	 defend 	 ing 	 	the	Internet	 it 	 self 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 communication 	 s 	 	medium	.
And	I	think	we	 prob 	 ably 	 	do	need	to	pay	some	more	attention	to	that	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	kind	of	fragile	.
So	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	in	the	early	 day 	 s 	 	,	back	when	it	was	the	ARPANET	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 time 	 s 	 	--	there	was	a	 part 	 icular 	 	time	it	 fail 	 ed 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	one	single	 mess 	 age 	 	processor	 actual 	 ly 	 	got	a	bug	in	it	.
And	the	way	the	Internet	 work 	 s 	 	is	the	 route 	 rs 	 	are	 bas 	 ically 	 	 ex 	 changing 	 	information	about	how	they	can	get	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	to	 place 	 s 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	one	processor	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	a	broken	card	,	 decide 	 d 	 	it	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	get	a	 mess 	 age 	 	to	some	place	in	negative	time	.
So	,	in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	it	 claim 	 ed 	 	it	could	deliver	a	 mess 	 age 	 	before	you	 s 	 ent 	 	it	.
So	of	course	,	the	 fast 	 est 	 	way	to	get	a	 mess 	 age 	 	 any 	 where 	 	was	to	 s 	 end 	 	it	to	 th 	 is 	 	guy	,	who	would	 s 	 end 	 	it	back	in	time	and	get	it	there	super	early	,	so	every	 mess 	 age 	 	in	the	Internet	 start 	 ed 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 s 	 witch 	 ed 	 	through	 th 	 is 	 	one	 no 	 de 	 	,	and	of	course	that	 clog 	 ged 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	up	.
 Every 	 thing 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	 break 	 ing 	 	.
The	 interest 	 ing 	 	thing	was	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	that	the	sysadmins	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	fix	it	,	but	they	had	to	 bas 	 ically 	 	turn	every	single	thing	on	the	Internet	off	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	of	course	you	could	n't	do	that	 to 	 day 	 	.
I	mean	,	 every 	 thing 	 	off	,	it	's	like	the	service	call	you	get	from	the	cable	company	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	for	the	whole	world	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	in	fact	,	they	could	n't	do	it	for	a	lot	of	 reason 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
One	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	is	a	lot	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 tele 	 phone 	 s 	 	use	IP	 proto 	 col 	 	and	use	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 Sky 	 pe 	 	and	so	on	that	go	through	the	Internet	right	now	,	and	so	in	fact	we	're	 be 	 coming 	 	dependent	on	it	for	more	and	more	different	 thing 	 s 	 	,	like	when	you	take	off	from	LAX	,	you	're	 re 	 ally 	 	not	 think 	 ing 	 	you	're	using	the	Internet	.
When	you	pump	gas	,	you	 re 	 ally 	 	do	n't	think	you	're	using	the	Internet	.
What	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	 increasing 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	is	these	 system 	 s 	 	are	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	use	the	Internet	.
 Mo 	 st 	 	of	them	are	n't	based	on	the	Internet	yet	,	but	they	're	 start 	 ing 	 	to	use	the	Internet	for	service	 function 	 s 	 	,	for	 administr 	 ative 	 	 function 	 s 	 	,	and	so	if	you	take	 some 	 thing 	 	like	the	cell	phone	system	,	which	is	still	 relat 	 ively 	 	 in 	 dependent 	 	of	the	Internet	for	the	most	part	,	Internet	 piece 	 s 	 	are	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	sneak	 in 	 to 	 	it	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	some	of	the	control	and	 administr 	 ative 	 	 function 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	so	 tempt 	 ing 	 	to	use	these	same	building	 block 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	work	so	well	,	they	're	cheap	,	they	're	 repeat 	 ed 	 	,	and	so	on	.
So	all	of	our	 system 	 s 	 	,	more	and	more	,	are	 start 	 ing 	 	to	use	the	same	technology	and	 start 	 ing 	 	to	depend	on	 th 	 is 	 	technology	.
And	so	even	a	modern	rocket	ship	these	 day 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	uses	Internet	 proto 	 col 	 	to	talk	from	one	end	of	the	rocket	ship	to	the	other	.
That	's	crazy	.	It	was	never	designed	to	do	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	.
So	we	've	built	 th 	 is 	 	system	where	we	understand	all	the	 part 	 s 	 	of	it	,	but	we	're	using	it	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	different	way	than	we	 expect 	 ed 	 	to	use	it	,	and	it	's	gotten	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	different	scale	than	it	was	designed	for	.
And	in	fact	,	 no 	 body 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	 understand 	 s 	 	all	the	 thing 	 s 	 	it	's	 be 	 ing 	 	used	for	right	now	.
It	's	 turn 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	one	of	these	big	 emerge 	 nt 	 	 system 	 s 	 	like	the	financial	system	,	where	we	've	designed	all	the	 part 	 s 	 	but	 no 	 body 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	 understand 	 s 	 	how	it	 oper 	 ates 	 	and	all	the	little	 detail 	 s 	 	of	it	and	what	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 emerge 	 nt 	 	 behavior 	 s 	 	it	can	have	.
And	so	if	you	hear	an	expert	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	Internet	and	 say 	 ing 	 	it	can	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	or	it	 do 	 es 	 	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	or	it	will	do	that	,	you	should	treat	it	with	the	same	 skeptic 	 ism 	 	that	you	might	treat	the	 comment 	 s 	 	of	an	economist	about	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	or	a	weatherman	about	the	weather	,	or	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	.
 The 	 y 	 	have	an	 inform 	 ed 	 	opinion	,	but	it	's	changing	so	 quick 	 ly 	 	that	even	the	 expert 	 s 	 	do	n't	know	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	's	going	on	.
So	if	you	see	one	of	these	 map 	 s 	 	of	the	Internet	,	it	's	just	 some 	 body 	 	's	guess	.
 No 	 body 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 know 	 s 	 	what	the	Internet	is	right	now	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	different	than	it	was	an	hour	ago	.
It	's	 constant 	 ly 	 	changing	.	It	's	 constant 	 ly 	 	 reconfigur 	 ing 	 	.
And	the	problem	with	it	is	,	I	think	we	are	setting	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	up	for	a	kind	of	disaster	like	the	disaster	we	had	in	the	financial	system	,	where	we	take	a	system	that	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	built	on	trust	,	was	 bas 	 ically 	 	built	for	a	smaller-scale	system	,	and	we	've	kind	of	 expand 	 ed 	 	it	way	beyond	the	 limit 	 s 	 	of	how	it	was	 me 	 ant 	 	to	 oper 	 ate 	 	.
And	so	right	now	,	I	think	it	's	 liter 	 ally 	 	true	that	we	do	n't	know	what	the	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	of	an	effective	denial-of-service	attack	on	the	Internet	would	be	,	and	 what 	 ever 	 	it	would	be	is	going	to	be	 wo 	 rse 	 	next	year	,	and	 wo 	 rse 	 	next	year	,	and	so	on	.
But	so	what	we	need	is	a	plan	B	.
There	is	no	plan	B	right	now	.
There	's	no	clear	 back 	 up 	 	system	that	we	've	 ver 	 y 	 	 care 	 fully 	 	 ke 	 pt 	 	to	be	 in 	 dependent 	 	of	the	Internet	,	made	out	of	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	 set 	 s 	 	of	building	 block 	 s 	 	.
So	what	we	need	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 necess 	 arily 	 	have	to	have	the	performance	of	the	Internet	,	but	the	police	 depart 	 ment 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	able	to	call	up	the	fire	 depart 	 ment 	 	even	 with 	 out 	 	the	Internet	,	or	the	 hospital 	 s 	 	have	to	order	fuel	oil	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	need	to	be	a	 multi 	 - 	 billion 	 - 	 dollar 	 	government	project	.
It	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 relat 	 ively 	 	simple	to	do	,	 technical 	 ly 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	can	use	 exist 	 ing 	 	 fiber 	 s 	 	that	are	in	the	ground	,	 exist 	 ing 	 	 wire 	 less 	 	 infra 	 structure 	 	.
It	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	a	matter	of	 dec 	 id 	 ing 	 	to	do	it	.
But	people	wo	n't	decide	to	do	it	 un 	 til 	 	they	 recogn 	 ize 	 	the	need	for	it	,	and	that	's	the	problem	that	we	have	right	now	.
So	there	's	 be 	 en 	 	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	people	,	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	us	have	 be 	 en 	 	 quiet 	 ly 	 	 argu 	 ing 	 	that	we	should	have	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 dependent 	 	system	for	 year 	 s 	 	,	but	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	get	people	focused	on	plan	B	when	plan	A	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	 work 	 ing 	 	so	well	.
So	I	think	that	,	if	people	understand	how	much	we	're	 start 	 ing 	 	to	depend	on	the	Internet	,	and	how	 vulner 	 able 	 	it	is	,	we	could	get	focused	on	just	 want 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	other	system	to	exist	,	and	I	think	if	 en 	 ough 	 	people	say	,	``	Yeah	,	I	would	like	to	use	it	,	I	'd	like	to	have	 s 	 uch 	 	a	system	,	''	then	it	will	get	built	.
It	's	not	that	hard	a	problem	.
It	could	 definite 	 ly 	 	be	 d 	 one 	 	by	people	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	.
And	so	I	think	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	of	all	the	 problem 	 s 	 	you	're	going	to	hear	about	at	the	 con 	 ference 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	one	of	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 eas 	 iest 	 	to	fix	.
So	I	'm	happy	to	get	a	chance	to	tell	you	about	it	.
Thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
I	am	going	to	be	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 secret 	 s 	 	.
 Obvious 	 ly 	 	the	best	way	to	 div 	 ul 	 ge 	 	a	secret	is	to	tell	 some 	 one 	 	to	not	say	 any 	 thing 	 	about	it	.
 Secret 	 s 	 	.	I	'm	using	 Power 	 Point 	 	 th 	 is 	 	year	just	 be 	 cause 	 	,	you	know	,	I	'm	 in 	 to 	 	the	TED	thing	.
And	when	you	use	these	 thing 	 s 	 	you	do	n't	have	to	go	like	that	.
You	just	press	it	.
Oh	,	man	.	Um	,	 y 	 es 	 	.
Yes	.	I	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	!	Just	change	it	!
 I 	 s 	 	Bill	 Gate 	 s 	 	here	?
Change	it	!	Come	on	!	What	?
Ah	!	 Oka 	 y 	 	.
That	's	not	my	 slide 	 s 	 	,	but	it	's	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
 A 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	these	are	all	 map 	 s 	 	.
And	 map 	 s 	 	are	 import 	 ant 	 	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	for	 transfer 	 ring 	 	information	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	if	you	have	human	cognitive	ability	.
We	can	see	that	all	 formula 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 map 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 human 	 s 	 	,	we	make	 map 	 s 	 	of	 place 	 s 	 	that	we	seldom	even	go	,	which	 seem 	 s 	 	a	little	 waste 	 ful 	 	of	time	.
 Th 	 is 	 	,	of	course	,	is	a	map	of	the	moon	.
There	're	some	 ver 	 y 	 	 de 	 light 	 ful 	 	 name 	 s 	 	.
 Tran 	 qui 	 lac 	 al 	 itis 	 	,	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	.	My	 favor 	 ite 	 	is	 F 	 rigor 	 is 	 	.
What	are	these	people	 think 	 ing 	 	?	 F 	 rigor 	 is 	 	?
What	the	 F 	 rigor 	 is 	 	you	 do 	 ing 	 	?	 Name 	 s 	 	are	 import 	 ant 	 	.
 F 	 rigor 	 is 	 	?	 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	 Mo 	 on 	 	.	People	could	live	there	one	day	.
I	'll	meet	you	at	 F 	 rigor 	 is 	 	.	No	.	I	do	n't	think	so	.
There	we	see	 Mar 	 s 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	with	 vari 	 ous 	 	 name 	 s 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	all	 d 	 one 	 	,	by	the	way	,	by	the	 Inter 	 national 	 	Astronomical	 Un 	 ion 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	an	actual	group	of	people	that	 s 	 it 	 	around	 na 	 ming 	 	planetary	 object 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	from	 the 	 ir 	 	actual	book	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	some	of	the	 name 	 s 	 	that	they	have	 chose 	 n 	 	,	 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	.
I	'll	go	through	a	little	of	them	.	 Bo 	 lotnitsa 	 	.
That	,	of	course	,	is	the	 Sla 	 vic 	 	swamp	 mer 	 maid 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	I	think	the	whole	 con 	 cept 	 	of	a	 mer 	 maid 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	blend	 in 	 to 	 	the	swamp	feel	.
``	Oh	look	!	 Mer 	 maid 	 	come	out	of	swamp	.	Oh	boy	!
It	's	time	for	 Bo 	 lotnitsa 	 	!	''
 D 	 ja 	 bran 	 	 Flu 	 ctu 	 s 	 	.
If	that	do	n't	flow	off	the	tongue	,	what	 do 	 es 	 	?
I	mean	 kid 	 s 	 	are	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	and	they	've	got	the	word	``	 fluctu 	 s 	 	''	up	there	.	That	's	wrong	.
One	 dy 	 s 	 lexic 	 	kid	and	he	could	be	 ruin 	 ing 	 	his	life	.
``	It	 fluctu 	 s 	 	up	,	Mama	.	''
Hikuleo	 Flu 	 ctu 	 s 	 	.
That	's	a	little	more	 flow 	 ing 	 	.	Hikuleo	 sound 	 s 	 	like	a	kind	of	a	 Leon 	 ard 	 o 	 	DiCaprio	17	syllable	thing	.
And	that	's	the	 Tong 	 a 	 	 under 	 world 	 	.
And	one	of	my	 favor 	 ites 	 	is	the	Itoki	 Flu 	 ctu 	 s 	 	,	who	is	the	 Nicaragua 	 n 	 	goddess	of	 insect 	 s 	 	,	 star 	 s 	 	,	and	 planet 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	if	you	're	a	goddess	of	 star 	 s 	 	and	 planet 	 s 	 	would	n't	you	relegate	 insect 	 s 	 	to	 some 	 body 	 	else	?
``	No	,	no	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	I	'm	so	 bus 	 y 	 	with	the	 star 	 s 	 	.
Would	you	mind	taking	the	 insect 	 s 	 	?	Thank	you	 darl 	 ing 	 	.
Oh	take	the	 spider 	 s 	 	too	.	I	know	they	're	not	 insect 	 s 	 	,	but	I	do	n't	care	.
 Mon 	 key 	 s 	 	,	 chimp 	 s 	 	,	just	get	rid	of	the	 hair 	 y 	 	 creature 	 s 	 	.	''
 N 	 ow 	 	,	we	're	going	to	be	going	to	 Mar 	 s 	 	one	day	.	And	when	we	do	,	it	's	going	to	be	 un 	 fair 	 	for	the	people	that	are	living	there	to	have	to	live	with	these	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	 name 	 s 	 	.
So	,	you	'll	be	on	 Mar 	 s 	 	,	and	you	're	at	 Hell 	 espointica 	 	Depressio	which	 ha 	 s 	 	got	to	be	a	 re 	 ally 	 	``	up	''	place	.
Yeah	,	I	'm	at	the	Depressio	,	and	I	want	to	get	over	to	 Amazon 	 is 	 	so	I	plug	it	 in 	 to 	 	the	 Mar 	 s 	 	map	,	and	click	the	button	and	there	's	my	 direction 	 s 	 	.
I	go	to	Chrysokeras	.
Left	to	the	 Th 	 ymiamata 	 	.
 Th 	 en 	 	to	 Ni 	 lia 	 cus 	 	 La 	 cus 	 	,	which	is	not	a	bad	name	.
 Ni 	 lia 	 cus 	 	 La 	 cus 	 	,	try	to	get	the	practice	,	 s 	 lick 	 - 	 a 	 - 	 tick 	 - 	 a 	 - 	 ba 	 cus 	 	.
That	's	a	cool	name	.	I	will	say	that	.
So	,	I	hold	back	a	little	of	my	venom	for	these	astronomical	 misnomer 	 s 	 	.
And	then	of	course	 Ar 	 non 	 	to	 Th 	 oth 	 	.
And	of	course	there	will	be	 advertise 	 ments 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	from	 the 	 ir 	 	rule	book	,	the	 Inter 	 national 	 	Astronomical	 Un 	 ion 	 	.
And	you	know	they	're	 inter 	 national 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	put	it	``	en	 Franc 	 ai 	 s 	 	''	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
 L 	 ' 	 Un 	 ion 	 	 Astro 	 nomi 	 que 	 	 Inter 	 national 	 e 	 	,	for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	do	n't	speak	French	.
I	thought	I	'd	 transl 	 ate 	 	for	you	.
From	the	 rule 	 book 	 	:	 No 	 men 	 cl 	 ature 	 	is	a	tool	.
The	first	 consider 	 ation 	 	,	make	it	clear	,	simple	and	 un 	 ambigu 	 ous 	 	.
And	I	think	that	 D 	 ja 	 bran 	 	 Flu 	 ctu 	 s 	 	,	that	 fit 	 s 	 	that	mode	.
That	's	simple	,	the	goddess	of	 goat 	 s 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	.
 D 	 ja 	 bran 	 	 Flu 	 ctu 	 s 	 	.
``	 N 	 ow 	 	,	Frank	is	 th 	 is 	 	clear	to	you	,	 D 	 ja 	 bran 	 	 Flu 	 ctu 	 s 	 	?	''
``	Yeah	,	that	's	the	goat	goddess	right	?	The	 Ab 	 acazan 	 ian 	 	?
It	's	clear	to	me	.	''
``	Listen	,	I	'm	going	back	to	the	swamp	 mer 	 maid 	 	.	Can	you	call	me	in	a	little	while	?	''
 Al 	 so 	 	,	from	the	actual	document	I	 high 	 light 	 ed 	 	a	part	I	thought	may	be	of	interest	.
 Any 	 one 	 	can	suggest	changing	a	name	.
So	,	I	look	to	you	,	fellow	member	of	the	Earth	community	.
We	've	got	to	change	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	up	fast	.
So	,	these	are	actual	 name 	 s 	 	of	people	that	work	there	.
I	did	some	more	investigation	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	more	people	 work 	 ing 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	group	.
And	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	they	do	n't	use	 the 	 ir 	 	first	 name 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	people	 na 	 ming 	 	 planet 	 s 	 	,	and	they	wo	n't	use	 the 	 ir 	 	first	 name 	 s 	 	.
 Some 	 thing 	 	is	 a 	 s 	 kew 	 	here	.
 I 	 s 	 	it	 be 	 cause 	 	his	name	is	 re 	 ally 	 	Jupiter	 Blu 	 n 	 ck 	 	?
 I 	 s 	 	that	 Gan 	 ymede 	 	 And 	 romeda 	 	 Bur 	 ba 	 	?
 I 	 s 	 	that	 Mar 	 s 	 	Ya	 Mar 	 ov 	 	?
I	do	n't	know	.	But	it	's	 invest 	 ig 	 ative 	 	material	,	no	doubt	.
There	are	some	mapping	people	who	do	use	 the 	 ir 	 	 name 	 s 	 	.
 W 	 it 	 ness 	 	 pleas 	 e 	 	,	 Eu 	 gene 	 	 Shoe 	 maker 	 	,	who	,	 diligent 	 ly 	 	,	from	a	young	boy	 decide 	 d 	 	he	 want 	 ed 	 	to	make	 map 	 s 	 	of	 ce 	 les 	 tial 	 	bodies	.
Must	have	 be 	 en 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	day	in	the	 Shoe 	 maker 	 	house	.
``	Mom	,	I	want	to	make	 map 	 s 	 	.	''
``	That	's	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 Eu 	 gene 	 	.	You	could	make	 map 	 s 	 	of	 Tor 	 onto 	 	.	''
``	No	,	I	want	to	make	 map 	 s 	 	of	 planet 	 s 	 	.	''
``	Yeah	,	go	to	your	room	.	''
 Mart 	 ians 	 	,	 Ven 	 us 	 ians 	 	,	 Jovian 	 s 	 	.
We	have	 name 	 s 	 	for	 place 	 s 	 	where	people	do	n't	exist	.
That	 seem 	 s 	 	a	little	 s 	 il 	 ly 	 	to	me	.
There	are	no	 Jovian 	 s 	 	.
 Get 	 ting 	 	back	to	my	 pre 	 mise 	 	,	I	used	 stamp 	 s 	 	,	by	the	way	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	do	n't	have	to	pay	 any 	 body 	 	for	the	 right 	 s 	 	.
There	is	 obvious 	 ly 	 	Einstein	,	Niels	 Bo 	 hr 	 	,	de	 Fer 	 mat 	 	's	last	 theor 	 em 	 	,	and	I	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	that	's	 Jam 	 es 	 	 Co 	 burn 	 	or	 Rich 	 ard 	 	 Har 	 ris 	 	.
It	's	 definite 	 ly 	 	one	of	the	two	.	I	'm	not	 re 	 ally 	 	clear	which	one	.
But	 obvious 	 ly 	 	the	point	is	that	 number 	 s 	 	are	 map 	 s 	 	.
And	 with 	 in 	 	 number 	 s 	 	,	is	there	an	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	secret	to	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	?
That	is	the	 pre 	 mise 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	 present 	 ation 	 	.
By	the	way	,	that	's	a	natural	picture	of	Saturn	,	no	 adjust 	 ments 	 	.	I	mean	that	's	just	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
So	 beaut 	 iful 	 	that	I	will	even	give	up	a	laugh	to	explain	my	love	of	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	planet	,	and	the	day	Saturday	,	named	after	it	,	 wonder 	 fully 	 	.
So	,	 formula 	 s 	 	 re 	 late 	 	number	to	form	.
That	's	 Eu 	 ler 	 	,	his	formula	was	one	of	the	 inspiration 	 s 	 	that	lead	to	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	string	 theor 	 y 	 	which	is	kind	of	cool	,	not	that	funny	,	but	it	is	cool	.
He	was	 al 	 so 	 	famous	for	 hav 	 ing 	 	no	body	.
 Whi 	 ch 	 	a	lot	of	you	are	like	,	``	How	did	he	figure	that	out	?	''
He	's	got	no	body	,	no	man	,	just	a	head	 float 	 ing 	 	high	.
 He 	 re 	 	 come 	 s 	 	 Eu 	 ler 	 	.
And	that	's	an	icosahedron	,	which	is	one	of	the	five	sacred	 solid 	 s 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 shape 	 s 	 	.
You	see	the	icosahedron	 aga 	 in 	 	.
The	dodecahedron	,	it	's	dual	.
There	is	a	dodecahedron	which	I	had	to	do	in	my	room	last	night	.
The	five	sacred	 solid 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	there	.
 Whi 	 ch 	 	is	not	to	be	 con 	 fused 	 	with	the	five	sacred	 s 	 al 	 ad 	 s 	 	.
Blue	cheese	,	ranch	,	oil	and	 vine 	 gar 	 	,	thousand	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	and	house	.
I	suggest	the	house	.
The	 re 	 ality 	 	,	now	here	is	 some 	 thing 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
What	's	 import 	 ant 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	these	 shape 	 s 	 	are	 dual 	 s 	 	of	each	other	.
And	you	can	see	how	the	icosahedron	 withdraw 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	dodecahedron	and	then	they	just	merge	 in 	 to 	 	each	other	.
So	,	the	whole	 con 	 cept 	 	of	 bran 	 es 	 	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	if	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	shaped	like	a	dodecahedron	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	map	of	what	could	possibly	be	.
And	that	is	,	of	course	,	what	we	are	here	to	talk	about	.
What	a	 co 	 incidence 	 	!
 Oct 	 ob 	 er 	 	9th	,	in	 Franc 	 e 	 	,	 Jean 	 - 	 Pier 	 re 	 	 Lu 	 mine 	 t 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	that	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	shaped	like	a	dodecahedron	,	based	on	information	that	they	got	from	 th 	 is 	 	 prob 	 e 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	would	be	a	normal	wave	pattern	.
But	what	they	're	 see 	 ing 	 	,	way	out	there	in	the	far	 reach 	 es 	 	of	the	 micro 	 wave 	 	 back 	 ground 	 	,	is	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	odd	 undul 	 ation 	 	.
It	 do 	 es 	 	n't	plug	in	to	what	they	 suspect 	 ed 	 	a	flat	 uni 	 verse 	 	would	be	.
So	,	you	can	kind	of	get	an	idea	from	 th 	 is 	 	 extrapol 	 ating 	 	that	back	under	 th 	 is 	 	huge	picture	,	so	we	get	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	what	the	 prim 	 al 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	like	.
And	 judg 	 ing 	 	from	 th 	 is 	 	,	it	 look 	 s 	 	a	little	like	a	 cheese 	 burger 	 	.
So	,	I	'm	 think 	 ing 	 	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	either	a	dodecahedron	or	a	 cheese 	 burger 	 	.
And	for	me	,	that	's	a	 win 	 - 	 win 	 	.
 Every 	 body 	 	 go 	 es 	 	,	I	'm	happy	.

 Get 	 ting 	 	back	to	the	point	of	my	 part 	 icular 	 	 present 	 ation 	 	,	Kepler	,	one	of	my	great	heroes	,	who	 real 	 ized 	 	that	these	five	 solid 	 s 	 	,	which	I	spoke	of	 ear 	 lier 	 	,	 we 	 re 	 	related	 some 	 how 	 	to	the	 planet 	 s 	 	,	but	he	could	n't	prove	it	.

``	Yes	,	Mama	.	''
 Al 	 right 	 	where	is	 th 	 is 	 	going	?	That	's	a	good	question	.
 He 	 re 	 	is	the	 pre 	 mise 	 	that	I	 beg 	 an 	 	27	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
If	 number 	 s 	 	can	express	the	 law 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 	that	we	live	,	I	reason	,	through	some	sort	of	reverse	 engineer 	 ing 	 	,	we	could	 extrapol 	 ate 	 	from	them	some	 bas 	 ic 	 	structural	element	of	 th 	 is 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
And	that	's	what	I	did	.	 Twenty 	 - 	 seven 	 	 year 	 s 	 	ago	I	 start 	 ed 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	.
And	I	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	build	a	particle	 accele 	 rator 	 	.
And	that	did	n't	work	out	well	.
So	,	then	I	thought	a	 calcul 	 ator 	 	is	a	metaphor	.
I	can	just	divide	 number 	 s 	 	,	that	's	like	atom	 s 	 mash 	 ing 	 	.
That	's	what	I	did	.	That	's	how	I	found	 Mole 	 ed 	 s 	 	.
 Mole 	 ed 	 s 	 	are	what	I	 believ 	 e 	 	the	thing	that	will	allow	string	 theor 	 y 	 	to	be	 prov 	 ed 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	are	the	 nod 	 es 	 	on	the	string	,	 pattern 	 s 	 	and	 relationship 	 s 	 	,	27	,	37	.
That	was	the	first	chart	I	came	up	with	.
You	can	see	,	even	if	you	do	n't	go	for	the	 number 	 s 	 	,	the	 beaut 	 y 	 	of	the	symmetry	.
The	 number 	 s 	 	from	one	to	36	,	 divid 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	six	 group 	 s 	 	.

There	is	so	 man 	 y 	 	 intric 	 ate 	 	 relationship 	 s 	 	that	I	'm	not	going	to	go	there	now	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	would	say	,	``	Hey	,	go	back	to	the	 Flu 	 ctu 	 s 	 	part	.	''

 O 	 nce 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	,	the	Cartesian	kind	of	 cross 	 - 	 over 	 	.
So	,	I	 s 	 aid 	 	if	I	'm	going	to	put	a	circle	,	see	what	kind	of	 pattern 	 s 	 	I	get	,	boom	,	the	Red	System	.
Look	at	that	.	You	ca	n't	just	make	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	up	,	 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	.

 Th 	 is 	 	is	beyond	 any 	 thing 	 	 any 	 body 	 	could	just	make	up	.

That	's	the	Green	System	.	It	all	 fold 	 s 	 	in	half	on	the	Green	System	,	right	between	18	and	19	.
The	Blue	System	.	The	 Viol 	 et 	 	.	It	's	all	there	.

It	so	 happen 	 s 	 	that	these	 weapon 	 s 	 	are	 danger 	 ous 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	of	a	new	nature	:	they	could	lead	the	world	 in 	 to 	 	a	digital	conflict	that	could	turn	 in 	 to 	 	an	 arm 	 ed 	 	struggle	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	virtual	 weapon 	 s 	 	can	 al 	 so 	 	destroy	the	physical	world	.
In	1982	,	in	the	middle	of	the	 Col 	 d 	 	War	in	Soviet	Siberia	,	a	 pipe 	 line 	 	 explode 	 d 	 	with	a	burst	of	3	 kilo 	 ton 	 s 	 	,	the	 equi 	 valent 	 	of	a	fourth	of	the	 Hiroshi 	 ma 	 	bomb	.

Even	more	 worry 	 ing 	 	for	the	 American 	 s 	 	,	in	 De 	 c 	 emb 	 er 	 	2008	the	 holi 	 est 	 	of	 holi 	 es 	 	,	the	IT	 system 	 s 	 	of	CENTCOM	,	the	central	command	 man 	 aging 	 	the	 war 	 s 	 	in	Iraq	and	 Afghan 	 istan 	 	,	may	have	 be 	 en 	 	 infilt 	 rated 	 	by	 hack 	 ers 	 	who	used	these	:	plain	but	 infect 	 ed 	 	 US 	 B 	 	 key 	 s 	 	.

 A 	 s 	 	a	result	,	the	 American 	 s 	 	take	the	threat	 ver 	 y 	 	 serious 	 ly 	 	.
I	'll	quote	 Gene 	 ral 	 	 Jam 	 es 	 	 Car 	 tw 	 right 	 	,	 V 	 ice 	 	 Chair 	 man 	 	of	the	 J 	 oint 	 	 Chief 	 s 	 	of	Staff	,	who	 say 	 s 	 	in	a	report	to	Congress	that	 cyber 	 attack 	 s 	 	could	be	 a 	 s 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 weapon 	 s 	 	of	mass	 destruct 	 ion 	 	.

And	to	understand	why	,	we	must	look	at	how	,	through	the	 age 	 s 	 	,	 militar 	 y 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	have	 maintain 	 ed 	 	or	 destroy 	 ed 	 	world	peace	.
if	we	'd	had	 TEDx 	 Paris 	 	350	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	we	would	have	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	the	 militar 	 y 	 	 innov 	 ation 	 	of	the	day	--	the	massive	 Vauban 	 - 	 style 	 	 fort 	 ification 	 s 	 	--	and	we	could	have	 predict 	 ed 	 	a	period	of	 st 	 ability 	 	in	the	world	or	in	 Euro 	 pe 	 	.
which	was	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	the	case	in	 Euro 	 pe 	 	between	1650	and	1750	.
 Similar 	 ly 	 	,	if	we	'd	had	 th 	 is 	 	talk	30	or	40	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	we	would	have	 s 	 een 	 	how	the	rise	of	nuclear	 weapon 	 s 	 	,	and	the	threat	of	 mutual 	 ly 	 	 assur 	 ed 	 	 destruct 	 ion 	 	they	 imp 	 ly 	 	,	 prevent 	 s 	 	a	direct	fight	between	the	two	 super 	 power 	 s 	 	.
 How 	 ever 	 	,	if	we	'd	had	 th 	 is 	 	talk	60	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	we	would	have	 s 	 een 	 	how	the	emergence	of	new	 air 	 craft 	 	and	tank	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	which	give	the	advantage	to	the	 attack 	 er 	 	,	make	the	Blitzkrieg	 doctri 	 ne 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	credible	and	thus	create	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	war	in	 Euro 	 pe 	 	.
So	 militar 	 y 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	can	influence	the	course	of	the	world	,	can	make	or	break	world	peace	--	and	there	lies	the	issue	with	cyber	 weapon 	 s 	 	.
The	first	issue	:	 Imagin 	 e 	 	a	potential	 ene 	 my 	 	 announc 	 ing 	 	they	're	building	a	 cyber 	 war 	 	unit	,	but	 on 	 ly 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	country	's	defense	.
 Oka 	 y 	 	,	but	what	 distinguish 	 es 	 	it	from	an	offensive	unit	?
It	 get 	 s 	 	even	more	 complic 	 ated 	 	when	the	 doctri 	 nes 	 	of	use	 be 	 come 	 	 ambigu 	 ous 	 	.
Just	3	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	both	the	U.S.	and	 Franc 	 e 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 invest 	 ing 	 	 militar 	 ily 	 	in	 cyber 	 space 	 	,	 strict 	 ly 	 	to	defend	 the 	 ir 	 	IT	 system 	 s 	 	.
But	 to 	 day 	 	both	 count 	 ries 	 	say	the	best	defense	is	to	attack	.
And	so	,	they	're	 join 	 ing 	 	China	,	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	 doctri 	 ne 	 	of	use	for	15	 year 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	both	defensive	and	offensive	.
The	second	issue	:	Your	country	could	be	under	 cyber 	 attack 	 	with	entire	 region 	 s 	 	 plunge 	 d 	 	 in 	 to 	 	total	 dark 	 ness 	 	,	and	you	may	not	even	know	who	's	 attack 	 ing 	 	you	.
 Cy 	 ber 	 	 weapon 	 s 	 	have	 th 	 is 	 	peculiar	feature	:	they	can	be	used	 with 	 out 	 	 leav 	 ing 	 	 trace 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 give 	 s 	 	a	tremendous	advantage	to	the	 attack 	 er 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 defend 	 er 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	know	who	to	fight	back	against	.
And	if	the	 defend 	 er 	 	 retali 	 ates 	 	against	the	wrong	 advers 	 ary 	 	,	they	risk	making	one	more	 ene 	 my 	 	and	 end 	 ing 	 	up	 diplomat 	 ically 	 	 isolate 	 d 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	issue	is	n't	just	 theoretic 	 al 	 	.
In	May	2007	,	Estonia	was	the	victim	of	 cyber 	 attack 	 s 	 	,	that	 damage 	 d 	 	 it 	 s 	 	communication	and	 bank 	 ing 	 	 system 	 s 	 	.
Estonia	 accus 	 ed 	 	Russia	.
But	 NA 	 TO 	 	,	 th 	 ough 	 	it	 defend 	 s 	 	Estonia	,	 react 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 prud 	 ent 	 ly 	 	.	Why	?
 Be 	 cause 	 	 NA 	 TO 	 	could	n't	be	100	%	 s 	 ure 	 	that	the	 K 	 rem 	 lin 	 	was	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	these	 attack 	 s 	 	.
So	to	sum	up	,	on	the	one	hand	,	when	a	possible	 ene 	 my 	 	 announce 	 s 	 	they	're	building	a	 cyber 	 war 	 	unit	,	you	do	n't	know	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	for	attack	On	the	other	hand	,	we	know	that	these	 weapon 	 s 	 	give	an	advantage	to	 attack 	 ing 	 	.
In	a	major	article	 publish 	 ed 	 	in	1978	,	 Profess 	 or 	 	 Ro 	 bert 	 	 Jer 	 vis 	 	of	Columbia	 Univers 	 ity 	 	in	New	York	 de 	 scribed 	 	a	model	to	understand	how	 conflict 	 s 	 	could	arise	.
In	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 text 	 	,	when	you	do	n't	know	if	the	potential	 ene 	 my 	 	is	 pre 	 par 	 ing 	 	for	defense	or	attack	,	and	if	the	 weapon 	 s 	 	give	an	advantage	to	 attack 	 ing 	 	,	then	 th 	 is 	 	environment	is	most	 like 	 ly 	 	to	spark	a	conflict	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	environment	that	's	 be 	 ing 	 	 create 	 d 	 	by	cyber	 weapon 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	and	 historic 	 ally 	 	it	was	the	environment	in	 Euro 	 pe 	 	at	the	 on 	 set 	 	of	World	War	I	.
So	cyber	 weapon 	 s 	 	are	 danger 	 ous 	 	by	nature	,	but	in	 add 	 ition 	 	,	they	're	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	in	a	much	more	 un 	 s 	 table 	 	environment	.
If	you	remember	the	 Col 	 d 	 	War	,	it	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	game	,	but	a	 s 	 table 	 	one	 play 	 ed 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	by	two	 player 	 s 	 	,	which	 allow 	 ed 	 	for	some	 coordi 	 nation 	 	between	the	two	 super 	 power 	 s 	 	.
 To 	 day 	 	we	're	moving	to	a	 multi 	 polar 	 	world	in	which	 coordi 	 nation 	 	is	much	more	 complic 	 ated 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	have	 s 	 een 	 	at	 C 	 open 	 ha 	 gen 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	 coordi 	 nation 	 	may	 be 	 come 	 	even	 trick 	 ier 	 	with	the	 introduc 	 tion 	 	of	cyber	 weapon 	 s 	 	.
Why	?	 Be 	 cause 	 	no	nation	 know 	 s 	 	for	 s 	 ure 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	 it 	 s 	 	neighbor	is	about	to	attack	.
So	 nation 	 s 	 	may	live	under	the	threat	of	what	 No 	 bel 	 	Prize	winner	 Thom 	 a 	 s 	 	 Sch 	 ell 	 ing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	``	 reciproc 	 al 	 	fear	of	surprise	attack	,	''	 a 	 s 	 	I	do	n't	know	if	my	neighbor	is	about	to	attack	me	or	not	--	I	may	never	know	--	so	I	might	take	the	upper	hand	and	attack	first	.
Just	last	week	,	in	a	New	York	 Time 	 s 	 	article	 d 	 ated 	 	 Jan 	 uary 	 	26	,	2010	,	it	was	 reveal 	 ed 	 	for	the	first	time	that	 official 	 s 	 	at	the	National	 Secur 	 ity 	 	 Age 	 ncy 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 consider 	 ing 	 	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	 pre 	 emptive 	 	 attack 	 s 	 	in	 case 	 s 	 	where	the	U.S.	was	about	to	be	 cyber 	 attack 	 ed 	 	.
And	these	 pre 	 emptive 	 	 attack 	 s 	 	might	not	just	remain	in	 cyber 	 space 	 	.
In	May	2009	,	 Gene 	 ral 	 	 K 	 e 	 vin 	 	 Chi 	 lton 	 	,	 command 	 er 	 	of	the	U.S.	nuclear	 force 	 s 	 	,	 state 	 d 	 	that	in	the	event	of	 cyber 	 attack 	 s 	 	against	the	U.S.	,	all	 option 	 s 	 	would	be	on	the	table	.
 Cy 	 ber 	 	 weapon 	 s 	 	do	not	replace	 convention 	 al 	 	or	nuclear	 weapon 	 s 	 	--	they	just	add	a	new	layer	to	the	 exist 	 ing 	 	system	of	terror	.
But	in	 do 	 ing 	 	so	,	they	 al 	 so 	 	add	 the 	 ir 	 	own	risk	of	 trigger 	 ing 	 	a	conflict	--	 a 	 s 	 	we	've	just	 s 	 een 	 	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	risk	--	and	a	risk	we	may	have	to	confront	with	a	 collect 	 ive 	 	security	solution	which	 include 	 s 	 	all	of	us	:	European	 al 	 lies 	 	,	 NA 	 TO 	 	 member 	 s 	 	,	our	American	 friend 	 s 	 	and	 al 	 lies 	 	,	our	other	Western	 al 	 lies 	 	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	,	by	forcing	 the 	 ir 	 	hand	a	little	,	our	 Russia 	 n 	 	and	 Chi 	 nese 	 	 partner 	 s 	 	.
The	information	 techno 	 logies 	 	 Jo 	 ël 	 	de	 Ro 	 s 	 na 	 y 	 	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	,	which	 we 	 re 	 	 historic 	 ally 	 	born	from	 militar 	 y 	 	research	,	are	 to 	 day 	 	on	the	 ver 	 ge 	 	of	 develop 	 ing 	 	an	offensive	 cap 	 ability 	 	of	 destruct 	 ion 	 	,	which	could	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	,	if	we	're	not	 care 	 ful 	 	,	 complete 	 ly 	 	destroy	world	peace	.
Thank	you	.
 Car 	 to 	 on 	 s 	 	are	 bas 	 ically 	 	short	 st 	 ories 	 	.
I	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	find	one	that	did	n't	have	a	whole	lot	of	 word 	 s 	 	.

So	you	have	to	make	a	living	 cartoon 	 ing 	 	.
 Actu 	 ally 	 	,	I	fell	in	love	with	the	ocean	when	I	was	a	little	boy	,	when	I	was	about	eight	or	nine	.
And	I	was	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 fascinate 	 d 	 	with	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	some	of	my	early	work	.
 Even 	 tu 	 ally 	 	,	my	mom	took	the	red	 cray 	 on 	 	away	,	so	it	was	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	.
But	I	'd	like	to	 re 	 lay 	 	to	you	a	 child 	 hood 	 	experience	of	mine	that	 re 	 ally 	 	made	me	see	the	ocean	 different 	 ly 	 	,	and	it	's	 be 	 come 	 	the	 found 	 ation 	 	of	my	work	 be 	 cause 	 	,	I	feel	like	,	if	in	a	day	,	I	can	see	the	ocean	 different 	 ly 	 	,	then	I	can	evoke	that	same	kind	of	change	in	 other 	 s 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	.
 Be 	 fore 	 	that	day	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	I	saw	the	ocean	.
It	's	just	a	big	blue	surface	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	the	ocean	since	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	time	.
It	's	a	 myster 	 y 	 	.
There	's	 be 	 en 	 	a	lot	of	 folk 	 lore 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	around	the	ocean	,	 most 	 ly 	 	negative	.
And	that	 prompt 	 ed 	 	people	to	make	 map 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	with	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 wonder 	 ful 	 	detail	on	the	land	,	but	when	you	get	to	the	 water 	 s 	 	edge	,	the	ocean	 look 	 s 	 	like	one	giant	 pudd 	 le 	 	of	blue	paint	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	way	I	saw	the	ocean	at	school	--	 a 	 s 	 	if	to	say	,	``	All	 geo 	 graphy 	 	and	science	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	stop	at	water	's	edge	.
 Th 	 is 	 	part	's	not	going	to	be	on	the	test	.	''
But	that	day	I	flew	low	over	the	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	--	it	was	a	family	trip	to	the	 Car 	 ib 	 bean 	 	,	and	I	flew	in	a	small	plane	low	over	the	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	what	I	saw	.	I	saw	 hill 	 s 	 	and	 val 	 ley 	 s 	 	.
I	saw	 forest 	 s 	 	and	 meadow 	 s 	 	.
I	saw	 grot 	 to 	 es 	 	and	secret	 garden 	 s 	 	and	 place 	 s 	 	I	'd	love	to	hide	 a 	 s 	 	a	kid	,	if	I	could	 on 	 ly 	 	breathe	 under 	 water 	 	.
And	best	of	all	,	I	saw	the	 animal 	 s 	 	.
I	saw	a	 man 	 ta 	 	ray	that	 look 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	big	 a 	 s 	 	the	plane	I	was	 fly 	 ing 	 	in	.
And	I	flew	over	a	 lag 	 oon 	 	with	a	 s 	 hark 	 	in	it	,	and	that	was	the	day	that	my	 com 	 ic 	 	strip	about	a	 s 	 hark 	 	was	born	.
So	from	that	day	on	,	I	was	an	 ordin 	 ary 	 	kid	 walk 	 ing 	 	around	on	dry	land	,	but	my	head	was	down	there	,	 under 	 water 	 	.
Up	 un 	 til 	 	that	day	,	these	 we 	 re 	 	the	 animal 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	most	common	in	my	life	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	 we 	 re 	 	the	 one 	 s 	 	I	'd	like	to	draw	--	all	 vari 	 ations 	 	of	four	 leg 	 s 	 	and	fur	.
But	when	you	got	to	the	ocean	,	my	 imagin 	 ation 	 	was	no	 com 	 petition 	 	for	nature	.
Every	time	I	'd	come	up	with	a	crazy	cartoon	character	on	the	 draw 	 ing 	 	board	,	I	'd	find	a	critter	in	the	ocean	that	was	even	 crazi 	 er 	 	.
And	the	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	in	scale	between	 th 	 is 	 	 tin 	 y 	 	sea	dragon	and	 th 	 is 	 	enormous	 hump 	 back 	 	whale	was	like	 some 	 thing 	 	out	of	a	 science 	 - 	 fiction 	 	movie	.
 When 	 ever 	 	I	talk	to	 kid 	 s 	 	,	I	 al 	 ways 	 	like	to	tell	them	,	the	 big 	 gest 	 	animal	that	ever	lived	is	still	 al 	 ive 	 	.
It	's	not	a	dinosaur	;	it	's	a	whale	,	 animal 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	big	 a 	 s 	 	 off 	 ice 	 	 building 	 s 	 	still	 swimm 	 ing 	 	around	out	there	in	our	ocean	.
 Speak 	 ing 	 	of	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 hark 	 s 	 	are	 bas 	 ically 	 	the	same	fish	they	 we 	 re 	 	300	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
So	if	you	ever	 fanta 	 s 	 ize 	 	about	going	back	in	time	and	 see 	 ing 	 	what	a	dinosaur	 look 	 ed 	 	like	,	that	's	what	a	dinosaur	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
So	you	have	living	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	and	space	 alien 	 s 	 	,	 animal 	 s 	 	that	 evolv 	 ed 	 	in	zero	 gravit 	 y 	 	in	harsh	 condition 	 s 	 	.
It	's	just	 in 	 credible 	 	;	no	 Hol 	 ly 	 wood 	 	 design 	 er 	 	could	come	up	with	 some 	 thing 	 	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	than	that	.
Or	 th 	 is 	 	 fang 	 tooth 	 	.	The	 particle 	 s 	 	in	the	water	make	it	look	like	it	's	 float 	 ing 	 	in	 out 	 er 	 	space	.
 Cou 	 ld 	 	you	image	if	we	 look 	 ed 	 	through	the	 Hu 	 bble 	 	 Tele 	 scope 	 	and	we	saw	that	?
It	would	start	a	whole	new	space	race	.
But	 in 	 stead 	 	,	we	stick	a	camera	in	the	deep	ocean	,	and	we	see	a	fish	,	and	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	capture	our	 imagin 	 ation 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
We	say	to	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	``	 May 	 be 	 	we	can	make	fish	 stick 	 s 	 	with	it	or	 some 	 thing 	 	.	''
So	,	what	I	'd	like	to	do	now	is	try	a	little	 draw 	 ing 	 	.
So	,	I	'm	going	to	try	to	draw	 th 	 is 	 	 fang 	 tooth 	 	here	.
I	love	to	draw	the	deep	sea	fish	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	are	so	 ug 	 ly 	 	,	but	 beaut 	 iful 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	own	way	.
 May 	 be 	 	we	can	give	him	a	little	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nce 	 	here	--	give	him	a	 head 	 light 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	a	brake	light	,	turn	 signal 	 s 	 	.
But	it	's	easy	to	see	why	these	 animal 	 s 	 	make	 s 	 uch 	 	great	cartoon	 character 	 s 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 shape 	 s 	 	and	 s 	 ize 	 s 	 	.
So	some	of	them	 actual 	 ly 	 	seem	to	have	 power 	 s 	 	like	 super 	 heroes 	 	in	a	 com 	 ic 	 	book	.
For	 in 	 stance 	 	,	take	these	sea	 turtle 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	kind	of	have	a	sixth	sense	like	 Super 	 man 	 	's	 x 	 - 	 ray 	 	vision	.
 The 	 y 	 	can	sense	the	 magnet 	 ic 	 	 field 	 s 	 	of	the	earth	.
And	they	can	use	that	sense	to	 navig 	 ate 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 mile 	 s 	 	of	open	ocean	.
I	kind	of	give	my	turtle	 hand 	 s 	 	just	to	make	them	an	 eas 	 ier 	 	cartoon	character	to	work	with	.
Or	take	 th 	 is 	 	sea	cucumber	.
It	's	not	an	animal	we	draw	 cartoon 	 s 	 	of	or	draw	at	all	.
He	's	like	an	 under 	 water 	 	 Spider 	 man 	 	.
He	 shoot 	 s 	 	out	these	 stick 	 y 	 	 web 	 s 	 	to	entangle	his	 ene 	 my 	 	.
Of	course	,	sea	 cucumber 	 s 	 	shoot	them	out	 the 	 ir 	 	 rear 	 s 	 	,	which	,	in	my	opinion	,	 make 	 s 	 	them	much	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	a	 super 	 hero 	 	.
He	ca	n't	spin	a	web	 any 	 time 	 	;	he	's	got	to	pull	his	pants	down	first	.
Or	the	 blow 	 fish 	 	.
The	 blow 	 fish 	 	is	like	the	 In 	 credible 	 	 Hu 	 lk 	 	.
It	can	change	 it 	 s 	 	body	 in 	 to 	 	a	big	,	 intimid 	 ating 	 	fish	in	a	matter	of	 second 	 s 	 	.
I	'm	going	to	draw	 th 	 is 	 	 blow 	 fish 	 	 un 	 inflated 	 	.
And	then	I	'm	going	to	attempt	 on 	 screen 	 	 anim 	 ation 	 	here	.
Let	's	see	.
 T 	 ry 	 	and	 infla 	 te 	 	it	.
``	You	 talk 	 in 	 	'	to	me	?	''	See	,	he	can	 infla 	 te 	 	 him 	 self 	 	when	he	 want 	 s 	 	to	be	 intimid 	 ating 	 	.
Or	take	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 word 	 fish 	 	.
 Cou 	 ld 	 	you	imagine	 be 	 ing 	 	born	with	a	tool	for	a	nose	?
Do	you	think	he	 wake 	 s 	 	up	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	 look 	 s 	 	in	the	mirror	and	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 Some 	 body 	 	's	 get 	 ting 	 	 stab 	 bed 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.	''
Or	 th 	 is 	 	 lion 	 fish 	 	for	 in 	 stance 	 	.
 Imagin 	 e 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	 friend 	 s 	 	 cover 	 ed 	 	with	 razor 	 - 	 sharp 	 	 poison 	 ous 	 	 barb 	 s 	 	.
It	's	not	 some 	 thing 	 	you	want	to	put	on	your	Facebook	page	,	right	?
My	 character 	 s 	 	are	--	my	lead	character	's	a	 s 	 hark 	 	named	 Sher 	 man 	 	.
He	's	a	great	white	 s 	 hark 	 	.
And	I	kind	of	broke	the	mold	with	 Sher 	 man 	 	.
I	did	n't	want	to	go	with	 th 	 is 	 	 ruth 	 less 	 	predator	image	.
He	's	kind	of	just	out	there	making	a	living	.
He	's	sort	of	a	 Hom 	 er 	 	Simpson	with	 fin 	 s 	 	.
And	then	his	 side 	 kick 	 	is	a	sea	turtle	,	 a 	 s 	 	I	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	before	,	named	 Film 	 ore 	 	.
He	uses	his	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 skill 	 s 	 	at	 navig 	 ation 	 	to	wander	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	,	looking	for	a	mate	.
And	he	 do 	 es 	 	manage	to	find	them	,	but	great	 navig 	 ation 	 	 skill 	 s 	 	,	 lous 	 y 	 	 pick 	 - 	 up 	 	lines	.
He	never	 seem 	 s 	 	to	settle	on	any	 part 	 icular 	 	girl	.
I	have	a	hermit	crab	named	Hawthorne	,	who	 do 	 es 	 	n't	get	a	lot	of	respect	 a 	 s 	 	a	hermit	crab	,	so	he	kind	of	 wish 	 es 	 	he	 we 	 re 	 	a	great	white	 s 	 hark 	 	.
And	then	I	'll	 introduc 	 e 	 	you	to	one	more	character	,	 th 	 is 	 	guy	,	 Er 	 nest 	 	,	who	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	a	juvenile	delinquent	in	a	fish	body	.
So	with	 character 	 s 	 	,	you	can	make	 st 	 ories 	 	.
 Some 	 time 	 s 	 	making	a	story	is	 a 	 s 	 	easy	 a 	 s 	 	 put 	 ting 	 	two	 character 	 s 	 	in	a	room	and	 see 	 ing 	 	what	 happen 	 s 	 	.
So	,	imagine	a	great	white	 s 	 hark 	 	and	a	giant	 s 	 quid 	 	in	the	same	 bath 	 room 	 	.
Or	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	I	take	them	to	 place 	 s 	 	that	people	have	never	heard	of	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	 under 	 water 	 	.
For	 in 	 stance 	 	,	I	took	them	 ski 	 ing 	 	in	the	 Mid 	 - 	 Atlantic 	 	 Rang 	 e 	 	,	which	is	 th 	 is 	 	range	of	 mountain 	 s 	 	in	the	middle	of	the	Atlantic	.
I	've	taken	them	to	the	Sea	of	Japan	,	where	they	met	giant	 jelly 	 fish 	 	.
I	've	taken	them	 camp 	 ing 	 	in	the	kelp	 forest 	 s 	 	of	California	.
 Th 	 is 	 	next	one	here	,	I	did	a	story	on	the	census	of	marine	life	.
And	that	was	a	lot	of	 f 	 un 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	most	of	you	know	,	it	's	a	real	project	we	've	heard	about	.
But	it	was	a	chance	for	me	to	 introduc 	 e 	 	 read 	 ers 	 	to	a	lot	of	crazy	 under 	 sea 	 	 character 	 s 	 	.
So	we	start	off	the	story	with	 Er 	 nest 	 	,	who	 volunteer 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	census	taker	.
He	 go 	 es 	 	down	and	he	 meet 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	famous	 angle 	 r 	 fish 	 	.
 Th 	 en 	 	he	 meet 	 s 	 	the	yeti	crab	,	the	famous	vampire	 s 	 quid 	 	--	elusive	,	hard	to	find	--	and	the	 Dum 	 bo 	 	 oct 	 opus 	 	,	which	 look 	 s 	 	so	much	like	a	cartoon	in	real	life	that	 re 	 ally 	 	did	n't	have	to	change	a	thing	when	I	drew	it	.
I	did	 an 	 other 	 	story	on	marine	 deb 	 ris 	 	.
I	was	 s 	 peaking 	 	to	a	lot	of	my	 friend 	 s 	 	in	the	 conserv 	 ation 	 	business	,	and	they	--	I	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	,	``	So	what	's	one	issue	you	would	like	 every 	 one 	 	to	know	more	about	?	''
And	they	 s 	 aid 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	one	friend	of	mine	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	I	've	got	one	word	for	you	:	plastic	.	''
And	I	told	him	,	``	Well	,	I	need	 some 	 thing 	 	a	little	 s 	 ex 	 ier 	 	than	that	.
 Plas 	 tic 	 	just	is	not	going	to	do	it	.	''
We	sort	of	 work 	 ed 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	out	.
He	 want 	 ed 	 	me	to	use	 word 	 s 	 	like	 poly 	 vinyl 	 	chloride	,	which	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	work	in	voice	 balloon 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	well	.
I	could	n't	fit	them	in	.
So	what	I	did	was	I	made	an	adventure	strip	.
 Bas 	 ically 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	bottle	 travel 	 s 	 	a	long	way	.
What	I	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	tell	 read 	 ers 	 	is	that	plastic	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	go	away	;	it	just	 continu 	 es 	 	to	wash	 down 	 stream 	 	.
And	a	lot	of	it	 end 	 s 	 	up	 wash 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	ocean	,	which	is	a	great	story	if	you	attach	a	couple	 character 	 s 	 	to	it	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	if	they	ca	n't	stand	each	other	,	like	these	two	.
So	,	I	 s 	 ent 	 	them	to	 Bo 	 ise 	 	,	 Ida 	 ho 	 	,	where	they	 drop 	 ped 	 	a	plastic	bottle	 in 	 to 	 	the	 Bo 	 ise 	 	 sew 	 er 	 	system	.
And	it	 end 	 ed 	 	up	in	the	 Bo 	 ise 	 	River	and	then	on	to	the	Columbia	River	and	then	to	the	mouth	of	the	Columbia	and	to	the	Pacific	Ocean	and	then	on	to	 th 	 is 	 	place	 call 	 ed 	 	the	Great	Pacific	 Gar 	 bag 	 e 	 	 Pat 	 ch 	 	--	which	is	 th 	 is 	 	giant	Pacific	 gy 	 re 	 	in	the	North	Pacific	,	where	a	lot	of	 th 	 is 	 	plastic	 end 	 s 	 	up	 float 	 ing 	 	around	--	and	then	back	onto	the	 lag 	 oon 	 	.
So	that	was	 bas 	 ically 	 	a	 bud 	 dy 	 	story	with	a	plastic	bottle	 follow 	 ing 	 	 a 	 long 	 	.
So	a	lot	of	people	remember	the	plastic	bottle	 any 	 way 	 	,	but	we	 re 	 ally 	 	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	marine	 deb 	 ris 	 	and	plastic	in	the	course	of	that	one	.
The	third	 story 	 line 	 	I	did	about	a	year	and	a	half	ago	was	 prob 	 ably 	 	my	most	difficult	.
It	was	on	 s 	 hark 	 	 fin 	 ning 	 	,	and	I	felt	 re 	 ally 	 	 strong 	 ly 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	issue	.
And	I	felt	like	,	since	my	main	character	was	a	 s 	 hark 	 	,	the	 com 	 ic 	 	strip	was	a	perfect	vehicle	for	 tell 	 ing 	 	the	public	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	 fin 	 ning 	 	is	the	act	of	taking	a	 s 	 hark 	 	,	cutting	the	 valu 	 able 	 	 fin 	 s 	 	off	and	 throw 	 ing 	 	the	live	animal	back	in	the	water	.
It	's	cruel	,	it	's	 waste 	 ful 	 	.
There	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	funny	or	 entertain 	 ing 	 	about	it	,	but	I	 re 	 ally 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	take	 th 	 is 	 	issue	on	.
I	had	to	kill	my	main	character	,	who	is	a	 s 	 hark 	 	.
We	start	with	 Sher 	 man 	 	in	a	 Chi 	 nese 	 	restaurant	,	who	 get 	 s 	 	a	fortune	that	he	's	about	to	get	caught	by	a	 trawl 	 er 	 	,	which	he	 do 	 es 	 	.
And	then	he	dies	.
He	 get 	 s 	 	 fin 	 ned 	 	,	and	then	he	 get 	 s 	 	 throw 	 n 	 	 over 	 board 	 	.
 O 	 sten 	 s 	 ibly 	 	,	he	's	dead	now	.
And	so	I	 kill 	 ed 	 	a	character	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	in	the	 news 	 paper 	 	for	15	 year 	 s 	 	.
So	I	got	a	lot	of	 read 	 er 	 	 feed 	 back 	 	on	that	one	.
 Mean 	 while 	 	,	the	other	 character 	 s 	 	are	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 s 	 hark 	 	fin	soup	.
I	do	three	or	four	 strip 	 s 	 	after	that	where	we	explore	the	 fin 	 ning 	 	issue	and	the	 s 	 hark 	 	fin	soup	issue	.
 Sher 	 man 	 	's	up	in	 s 	 hark 	 	heaven	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	what	I	love	about	 com 	 ic 	 	 strip 	 s 	 	,	you	know	.
You	 re 	 ally 	 	do	n't	have	to	worry	about	the	audience	 suspend 	 ing 	 	 it 	 s 	 	sense	of	 dis 	 belief 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	,	if	you	start	with	a	 talk 	 ing 	 	 s 	 hark 	 	,	 read 	 ers 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	check	 the 	 ir 	 	 dis 	 belief 	 	at	the	door	.
You	can	kind	of	do	 any 	 thing 	 	.
It	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	 near 	 - 	 death 	 	experience	for	 Sher 	 man 	 	.
 Mean 	 while 	 	,	 Er 	 nest 	 	 find 	 s 	 	his	 fin 	 s 	 	on	the	 inter 	 net 	 	.
There	was	a	real	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	based	in	China	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 old 	 	 s 	 hark 	 	 fin 	 s 	 	,	so	I	kind	of	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	that	.
And	he	 click 	 s 	 	the	``	buy	now	''	button	.
And	 vo 	 ila 	 	,	 next 	 - 	 day 	 	air	,	they	show	up	,	and	they	 sur 	 gical 	 ly 	 	 re 	 attach 	 	them	.
I	 end 	 ed 	 	that	 s 	 eries 	 	with	a	kind	of	a	 mail 	 - 	 in 	 	petition	that	 encourag 	 ed 	 	our	National	Marine	 Fish 	 ery 	 	Service	,	to	force	other	 count 	 ries 	 	to	have	a	 strong 	 er 	 	stance	with	 s 	 hark 	 	management	.
 Thank 	 s 	 	.
I	'd	like	to	end	with	a	little	metaphor	here	.
I	've	 be 	 en 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	think	of	a	metaphor	to	represent	 Miss 	 ion 	 	Blue	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	I	came	up	with	.
 Imagin 	 e 	 	you	're	in	an	enormous	room	,	and	it	's	 a 	 s 	 	dark	 a 	 s 	 	a	cave	.
And	you	can	have	 any 	 thing 	 	in	that	room	,	 any 	 thing 	 	you	want	,	but	you	ca	n't	see	 any 	 thing 	 	.
You	've	 be 	 en 	 	 give 	 n 	 	one	tool	,	a	hammer	.
So	you	wander	around	in	the	 dark 	 ness 	 	,	and	you	bump	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	,	and	it	 feel 	 s 	 	like	it	's	made	of	stone	.
It	's	big	,	it	's	heavy	.	You	ca	n't	carry	it	away	,	so	you	bang	it	with	your	hammer	,	and	you	break	off	a	piece	.
And	you	take	the	piece	out	 in 	 to 	 	the	 day 	 light 	 	.
And	you	see	you	have	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	piece	of	white	 ala 	 ba 	 ster 	 	.
So	you	say	to	 your 	 self 	 	,	``	Well	,	that	's	worth	 some 	 thing 	 	.	''
So	you	go	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	room	,	and	you	break	 th 	 is 	 	thing	to	 piece 	 s 	 	,	and	you	haul	it	away	.
And	you	find	other	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	you	break	that	up	,	and	you	haul	 t 	 hose 	 	away	.
And	you	're	 get 	 ting 	 	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	cool	stuff	.
And	you	hear	other	people	 do 	 ing 	 	the	same	thing	.
So	you	get	 th 	 is 	 	sense	of	 urge 	 ncy 	 	,	like	you	need	to	find	 a 	 s 	 	much	stuff	 a 	 s 	 	possible	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	possible	.
And	then	some	 yell 	 s 	 	,	``	 S 	 top 	 	!	''
And	they	turn	up	the	 light 	 s 	 	.
And	you	 real 	 ize 	 	where	you	are	;	you	're	in	the	 Lou 	 v 	 re 	 	.
And	you	've	taken	all	 th 	 is 	 	 complex 	 ity 	 	and	 beaut 	 y 	 	,	and	you	've	 turn 	 ed 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	cheap	 commodit 	 y 	 	.
And	that	's	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	with	the	ocean	.
And	part	of	what	 Miss 	 ion 	 	Blue	is	about	is	 yell 	 ing 	 	,	``	 S 	 top 	 	!	''
so	that	each	of	us	--	 explore 	 r 	 	,	scientist	,	 cartoon 	 ist 	 	,	 s 	 ing 	 er 	 	,	chef	--	can	turn	up	the	 light 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	own	way	.
And	that	's	what	I	hope	my	 com 	 ic 	 	strip	 do 	 es 	 	in	a	small	way	.
That	's	why	I	like	what	I	do	.
 Thank 	 s 	 	for	 listen 	 ing 	 	.
Well	,	good	 morn 	 ing 	 	 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	.
My	name	is	Art	 Ben 	 jam 	 in 	 	,	and	I	am	a	``	 mathe 	 magic 	 ian 	 	.	''
What	that	 mean 	 s 	 	is	,	I	combine	my	 love 	 s 	 	of	math	and	magic	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	I	call	``	 mathe 	 magic 	 s 	 	.	''
But	before	I	get	 start 	 ed 	 	,	I	have	a	quick	question	for	the	audience	.
By	any	chance	,	did	 any 	 one 	 	happen	to	 br 	 ing 	 	with	them	 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	a	 calcul 	 ator 	 	?
 S 	 er 	 iously 	 	,	if	you	have	a	 calcul 	 ator 	 	with	you	,	raise	your	hand	,	raise	your	hand	.
I	--	was	--	your	hand	go	up	?
 N 	 ow 	 	 br 	 ing 	 	it	out	,	 br 	 ing 	 	it	out	.	 Any 	 body 	 	else	?
I	see	,	I	see	one	way	in	the	back	.
You	 s 	 ir 	 	,	that	's	three	,	And	 any 	 body 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	side	here	?
 O 	 K 	 	,	you	over	there	on	the	aisle	.	Would	the	four	of	you	with	 calcul 	 ators 	 	 pleas 	 e 	 	 br 	 ing 	 	out	your	 calcul 	 ators 	 	,	then	join	me	up	on	stage	.
And	let	's	give	these	 volunteer 	 s 	 	a	nice	round	of	 app 	 laus 	 e 	 	.
That	's	right	.	 N 	 ow 	 	,	since	I	have	n't	had	the	chance	to	work	with	these	 calcul 	 ators 	 	,	I	need	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	they	are	all	 work 	 ing 	 	 proper 	 ly 	 	.
Would	 some 	 body 	 	get	us	 start 	 ed 	 	by	giving	us	a	 two 	 - 	 digit 	 	number	 pleas 	 e 	 	?
How	about	a	 two 	 - 	 digit 	 	number	?
 Audi 	 ence 	 	:	22	.
Arthur	 Ben 	 jam 	 in 	 	:	22	.	And	 an 	 other 	 	 two 	 - 	 digit 	 	number	,	Sir	?
 Audi 	 ence 	 	:	47	.
AB	:	 Multi 	 ply 	 	22	 time 	 s 	 	47	,	make	 s 	 ure 	 	you	get	1,034	,	or	the	 calcul 	 ators 	 	are	not	 work 	 ing 	 	.	Do	all	of	you	get	1,034	?	1,034	?
 Wo 	 man 	 	:	No	.
AB	:	594	.	Let	's	give	three	of	them	a	nice	round	of	 app 	 laus 	 e 	 	there	.
Would	you	like	to	try	a	more	standard	 calcul 	 ator 	 	,	just	in	case	?
 O 	 K 	 	,	great	.
What	I	'm	going	to	try	and	do	then	--	I	notice	that	took	some	of	you	a	little	bit	of	time	to	get	your	answer	.
That	's	 O 	 K 	 	.	I	'll	give	you	a	 short 	 cut 	 	for	 multi 	 ply 	 ing 	 	even	 fast 	 er 	 	on	the	 calcul 	 ator 	 	.
There	is	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	square	of	a	number	,	which	most	of	you	know	is	taking	a	number	and	 multi 	 ply 	 ing 	 	it	by	 it 	 self 	 	.
For	 in 	 stance 	 	,	five	 square 	 d 	 	would	be	?
 Audi 	 ence 	 	:	25	.
AB	:	25	.	 N 	 ow 	 	,	the	way	we	can	square	on	most	 calcul 	 ators 	 	--	let	me	 demonst 	 rate 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	one	--	is	by	taking	the	number	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	five	,	hitting	``	 time 	 s 	 	''	and	then	``	 equal 	 s 	 	,	''	and	on	most	 calcul 	 ators 	 	that	will	give	you	the	square	.
On	some	of	these	ancient	 RP 	 N 	 	 calcul 	 ators 	 	,	you	've	got	an	``	x	 square 	 d 	 	''	button	on	it	,	will	allow	you	to	do	the	 calcul 	 ation 	 	even	 fast 	 er 	 	.
What	I	'm	going	to	try	and	do	now	is	to	square	,	in	my	head	,	four	 two 	 - 	 digit 	 	 number 	 s 	 	 fast 	 er 	 	than	they	can	do	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 calcul 	 ators 	 	,	even	using	the	 short 	 cut 	 	method	.
What	I	'll	use	is	the	second	row	 th 	 is 	 	time	,	and	I	'll	get	four	of	you	--	one	,	two	,	three	,	four	--	to	each	yell	out	a	 two 	 - 	 digit 	 	number	,	and	if	you	would	square	the	first	number	,	and	if	you	would	square	the	second	,	the	third	and	the	fourth	,	I	will	try	and	race	you	to	the	answer	.	 O 	 K 	 	?
So	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	a	 two 	 - 	 digit 	 	number	 pleas 	 e 	 	.

 N 	 ow 	 	you	can	all	take	your	time	on	 th 	 is 	 	;	I	will	not	beat	you	to	the	answer	on	 th 	 is 	 	one	,	but	I	will	try	to	get	the	answer	right	.
To	make	 th 	 is 	 	a	little	bit	more	random	,	let	's	take	the	fourth	row	 th 	 is 	 	time	,	let	's	say	,	one	,	two	,	three	,	four	.
If	each	of	you	would	call	out	a	single	digit	between	zero	and	nine	,	that	will	be	the	 four 	 - 	 digit 	 	number	that	I	'll	square	.
 Audi 	 ence 	 	:	Nine	.
AB	:	Nine	.
 Audi 	 ence 	 	:	Seven	.	AB	:	Seven	.
 Audi 	 ence 	 	:	Five	.	AB	:	Five	.
 Audi 	 ence 	 	:	Eight	.	AB	:	Eight	.
9,758	,	 th 	 is 	 	will	take	me	a	little	bit	of	time	,	so	bear	with	me	.
95,218,564	?
 Wo 	 man 	 	:	Yes	.
AB	:	Thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	I	would	attempt	to	square	a	 five 	 - 	 digit 	 	number	--	and	I	can	--	but	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	most	 calcul 	 ators 	 	can	not	.
 Eight 	 - 	 digit 	 	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	--	do	n't	you	hate	that	?
So	,	since	we	've	 reach 	 ed 	 	the	 limit 	 s 	 	of	our	 calcul 	 ators 	 	--	what	's	that	?	 Do 	 es 	 	 your 	 s 	 	go	--	 Wo 	 man 	 	:	I	do	n't	know	.
AB	:	 Do 	 es 	 	 your 	 s 	 	go	 high 	 er 	 	?
Oh	--	 your 	 s 	 	 do 	 es 	 	?
Man	:	I	can	 prob 	 ably 	 	do	it	.
AB	:	I	'll	talk	to	you	 lat 	 er 	 	.
In	the	 mean 	 while 	 	,	let	me	conclude	the	first	part	of	my	show	by	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	a	little	 trick 	 ier 	 	.
Let	's	take	the	largest	number	on	the	board	here	,	8649	.
Would	you	each	enter	that	on	your	 calcul 	 ator 	 	?
And	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 s 	 quar 	 ing 	 	it	 th 	 is 	 	time	,	I	want	you	to	take	that	number	and	 multi 	 ply 	 	it	by	any	 three 	 - 	 digit 	 	number	that	you	want	,	but	do	n't	tell	me	what	you	're	 multi 	 ply 	 ing 	 	by	--	just	 multi 	 ply 	 	it	by	any	random	 three 	 - 	 digit 	 	number	.
So	you	should	have	 a 	 s 	 	an	answer	either	a	 six 	 - 	 digit 	 	or	 prob 	 ably 	 	a	 seven 	 - 	 digit 	 	number	.
How	 man 	 y 	 	 digit 	 s 	 	do	you	have	,	six	or	seven	?
Seven	,	and	 your 	 s 	 	?	 Wo 	 man 	 	:	Seven	.
AB	:	Seven	?	Seven	?
And	,	 un 	 certain 	 	.
Man	:	Yeah	.
AB	:	Seven	.	 I 	 s 	 	there	any	possible	way	that	I	could	know	what	seven	digit	 number 	 s 	 	you	have	?	Say	``	No	.	''
Good	.	 Th 	 en 	 	I	 s 	 hall 	 	attempt	the	 im 	 possible 	 	--	or	at	 l 	 east 	 	the	 im 	 prob 	 able 	 	.
What	I	'd	like	each	of	you	to	do	is	to	call	out	for	me	any	six	of	your	seven	 digit 	 s 	 	,	any	six	of	them	,	in	any	order	you	'd	like	.
One	digit	at	a	time	,	I	 s 	 hall 	 	try	and	determine	the	digit	you	've	left	out	.
So	,	 start 	 ing 	 	with	your	 seven 	 - 	 digit 	 	number	,	call	out	any	six	of	them	 pleas 	 e 	 	.
 Wo 	 man 	 	:	One	,	 O 	 K 	 	,	197042	.
AB	:	Did	you	 leav 	 e 	 	out	the	number	6	?
 Wo 	 man 	 	:	Yes	,	AB	:	Good	,	 O 	 K 	 	,	that	's	one	.
You	have	a	 seven 	 - 	 digit 	 	number	,	call	out	any	six	of	them	 pleas 	 e 	 	.
 Wo 	 man 	 	:	44875	.
AB	:	I	think	I	 on 	 ly 	 	heard	five	 number 	 s 	 	.	I	--	wait	--	44875	--	did	you	 leav 	 e 	 	out	the	number	6	?
 Wo 	 man 	 	:	Yes	.	AB	:	 Sam 	 e 	 	 a 	 s 	 	she	did	,	 O 	 K. 	 	You	've	got	a	 seven 	 - 	 digit 	 	number	--	call	out	any	six	of	them	loud	and	clear	.
Man	:	079044	.
AB	:	I	think	you	left	out	the	number	3	?
That	's	three	.	The	 odd 	 s 	 	of	me	 get 	 ting 	 	all	four	of	these	right	by	random	 guess 	 ing 	 	would	be	one	in	10,000	:	10	to	the	fourth	power	.
 O 	 K 	 	,	any	six	of	them	.
 Re 	 ally 	 	scramble	them	up	 th 	 is 	 	time	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	.
Man	:	263972	.
AB	:	Did	you	 leav 	 e 	 	out	the	number	7	?
And	let	's	give	all	four	of	these	people	a	nice	round	of	 app 	 laus 	 e 	 	.
Thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
For	my	next	number	--	while	I	 ment 	 ally 	 	 re 	 charge 	 	my	 batt 	 eries 	 	,	I	have	one	more	question	for	the	audience	.
By	any	chance	,	 do 	 es 	 	 any 	 body 	 	here	happen	to	know	the	day	of	the	week	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	born	on	?
If	you	think	you	know	your	birth	day	,	raise	your	hand	.
Let	's	see	,	 start 	 ing 	 	with	--	let	's	start	with	a	 gentle 	 man 	 	first	,	 O 	 K 	 	 s 	 ir 	 	,	what	year	was	it	,	first	of	all	?	That	's	why	I	start	with	a	 gentle 	 man 	 	first	.
What	year	?
 Audi 	 ence 	 	:	1953	.

AB	:	23rd	--	was	that	a	 Mon 	 day 	 	?	 Audi 	 ence 	 	:	Yes	.
Yes	,	good	.	 Some 	 body 	 	else	?	Who	else	would	like	--	see	I	do	n't	--	have	n't	 s 	 een 	 	any	women	's	 hand 	 s 	 	up	.
 O 	 K 	 	,	it	's	--	how	about	you	,	what	year	?

 Audi 	 ence 	 	:	Yes	.
AB	:	Thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
 Any 	 body 	 	here	who	'd	like	to	know	the	day	of	the	week	they	 we 	 re 	 	born	?
We	can	do	it	that	way	.
Of	course	,	I	could	just	make	up	an	answer	and	you	would	n't	know	,	so	I	come	prepared	for	that	.
I	 br 	 ought 	 	with	me	a	book	of	 calendar 	 s 	 	.
It	 go 	 es 	 	 a 	 s 	 	far	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	past	 a 	 s 	 	1800	,	'cause	you	never	know	.
I	did	n't	mean	to	look	at	you	,	 s 	 ir 	 	--	you	 we 	 re 	 	just	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	.
 Any 	 way 	 	,	Chris	,	you	can	help	me	out	here	,	if	you	would	n't	mind	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	book	of	 calendar 	 s 	 	,	and	I	'll	ask	--	who	was	it	that	 want 	 ed 	 	to	know	 the 	 ir 	 	birth	day	?	You	 s 	 ir 	 	?	 O 	 K 	 	.
What	year	was	it	,	first	of	all	?
 Audi 	 ence 	 	:	1966	.
AB	:	'66	--	turn	to	the	calendar	with	1966	--	and	what	month	?
 Audi 	 ence 	 	:	April	.	AB	:	April	what	?
 Audi 	 ence 	 	:	17th	.	AB	:	17th	--	I	 believ 	 e 	 	that	was	a	 Sun 	 day 	 	.
Can	you	confirm	,	Chris	?
Chris	 And 	 er 	 son 	 	:	Yes	.	AB	:	Yeah	,	 O 	 K 	 	.	I	'll	tell	you	what	,	Chris	:	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	you	have	that	book	in	front	of	you	,	do	me	a	favor	,	turn	to	a	year	 out 	 side 	 	of	the	1900s	,	either	 in 	 to 	 	the	1800s	or	way	 in 	 to 	 	the	2000s	--	that	'll	be	a	much	 great 	 er 	 	 challeng 	 e 	 	for	me	.
What	year	,	Chris	,	would	you	like	?
CA	:	1824	.
AB	:	1824	,	 O 	 K 	 	.
And	what	month	?	CA	:	 Ju 	 ne 	 	.
AB	:	 Ju 	 ne 	 	what	?	CA	:	Sixth	.
AB	:	Sixth	--	was	that	a	 Sun 	 day 	 	?
CA	:	It	was	.	AB	:	And	it	was	 cloud 	 y 	 	.
Good	,	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
But	I	'd	like	to	wrap	 thing 	 s 	 	up	now	by	 allud 	 ing 	 	to	 some 	 thing 	 	from	 ear 	 lier 	 	in	the	 present 	 ation 	 	.
There	was	a	 gentle 	 man 	 	up	here	who	had	a	10-digit	 calcul 	 ator 	 	.
Where	is	he	,	would	you	stand	up	,	10-digit	guy	?
 O 	 K 	 	,	well	stand	up	for	me	just	for	a	second	,	so	I	can	see	where	you	are	.
 O 	 K 	 	,	oh	,	 O 	 K 	 	--	you	have	a	10-digit	 calcul 	 ator 	 	,	 s 	 ir 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	?
 O 	 K 	 	,	what	I	'm	going	to	try	and	do	,	is	to	square	in	my	head	a	 five 	 - 	 digit 	 	number	 requir 	 ing 	 	a	10-digit	 calcul 	 ator 	 	.
But	to	make	my	job	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	for	you	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	for	me	,	I	'm	going	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	problem	 think 	 ing 	 	out	loud	.
So	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 honest 	 ly 	 	hear	what	's	going	on	in	my	mind	while	I	do	a	 calcul 	 ation 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 ize 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	I	have	to	 apolog 	 ize 	 	to	our	 magic 	 ian 	 	friend	 Len 	 n 	 art 	 	Green	.
I	know	 a 	 s 	 	a	 magic 	 ian 	 	we	're	not	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	reveal	our	 secret 	 s 	 	,	but	I	'm	not	too	 af 	 raid 	 	that	people	are	going	to	start	 do 	 ing 	 	my	show	next	week	,	so	--	I	think	we	're	 O 	 K 	 	.
So	,	let	's	see	,	let	's	take	a	--	let	's	take	a	different	row	of	people	,	 start 	 ing 	 	with	you	.
I	'll	get	five	 digit 	 s 	 	:	one	,	two	,	three	,	four	--	oh	,	I	did	 th 	 is 	 	row	 al 	 ready 	 	.	Let	's	do	the	row	before	you	,	 start 	 ing 	 	with	you	 s 	 ir 	 	:	one	,	two	,	three	,	four	,	five	.
Call	out	a	single	digit	--	that	will	be	the	 five 	 - 	 digit 	 	number	that	I	will	try	to	square	.	Go	 a 	 head 	 	.
 Audi 	 ence 	 	:	Five	.	AB	:	Five	.
 Audi 	 ence 	 	:	Seven	.	AB	:	Seven	.
 Audi 	 ence 	 	:	Six	.	AB	:	Six	.
 Audi 	 ence 	 	:	Eight	.	AB	:	Eight	.
 Audi 	 ence 	 	:	Three	.	AB	:	Three	.
57,683	 square 	 d 	 	.	Yuck	.
Let	me	explain	to	you	how	I	'm	going	to	attempt	 th 	 is 	 	problem	.
I	'm	going	to	break	the	problem	down	 in 	 to 	 	three	 part 	 s 	 	.
I	'll	do	57,000	 square 	 d 	 	,	plus	683	 square 	 d 	 	,	plus	57,000	 time 	 s 	 	683	 time 	 s 	 	two	.
Add	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 number 	 s 	 	together	,	and	with	any	luck	,	 arriv 	 e 	 	at	the	answer	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	let	me	 re 	 cap 	 	.
Thank	you	.
 Whi 	 le 	 	I	explain	 some 	 thing 	 	else	--	--	I	know	,	that	you	can	use	,	right	?
 Whi 	 le 	 	I	do	these	 calcul 	 ation 	 	[	s	]	,	you	might	hear	certain	 word 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	 number 	 s 	 	,	creep	 in 	 to 	 	the	 calcul 	 ation 	 	.
Let	me	explain	what	that	is	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	 phone 	 tic 	 	code	,	a	mnemonic	 de 	 vice 	 	that	I	use	,	that	 allow 	 s 	 	me	to	convert	 number 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 word 	 s 	 	.
I	store	them	 a 	 s 	 	 word 	 s 	 	,	and	 lat 	 er 	 	on	retrieve	them	 a 	 s 	 	 number 	 s 	 	.
I	know	it	 sound 	 s 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	;	it	's	not	--	I	just	do	n't	want	you	to	think	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	out	of	``	Rain	Man	''	here	.
There	's	 definite 	 ly 	 	a	method	to	my	 mad 	 ness 	 	--	 definite 	 ly 	 	,	 definite 	 ly 	 	.	 So 	 rry 	 	.
If	you	want	to	talk	to	me	about	 AD 	 HD 	 	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	,	you	can	talk	to	me	then	.	All	right	--	by	the	way	,	one	last	 instruct 	 ion 	 	,	for	my	 judg 	 es 	 	with	the	 calcul 	 ators 	 	--	 O 	 K 	 	,	you	know	who	you	are	--	there	is	at	 l 	 east 	 	a	50	percent	chance	that	I	will	make	a	 mistak 	 e 	 	here	.
If	I	do	,	do	n't	tell	me	what	the	 mistak 	 e 	 	is	;	just	say	,	``	you	're	close	,	''	or	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	,	and	I	'll	try	and	figure	out	the	answer	--	which	could	be	 pre 	 tty 	 	 entertain 	 ing 	 	in	 it 	 self 	 	.
If	,	 how 	 ever 	 	,	I	am	right	,	 what 	 ever 	 	you	do	,	do	n't	keep	it	to	 your 	 self 	 	,	 O 	 K 	 	?
Make	 s 	 ure 	 	 every 	 body 	 	 know 	 s 	 	that	I	got	the	answer	right	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	big	finish	,	 O 	 K 	 	.
So	,	 with 	 out 	 	any	more	 stall 	 ing 	 	,	here	we	go	.
I	'll	start	the	problem	in	the	middle	,	with	57	 time 	 s 	 	683	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	57	 time 	 s 	 	68	is	3,400	,	plus	476	is	3876	,	that	's	38,760	plus	171	,	38,760	plus	171	is	38,931	.
38,931	;	double	that	to	get	77,862	.
77,862	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	cookie	 fi 	 s 	 s 	 ion 	 	,	cookie	 fi 	 s 	 s 	 ion 	 	is	77,822	.
That	 seem 	 s 	 	right	,	I	'll	go	on	.	 Cook 	 ie 	 	 fi 	 s 	 s 	 ion 	 	,	 O 	 K 	 	.
Next	,	I	do	57	 square 	 d 	 	,	which	is	3,249	,	so	I	can	say	,	three	billion	.	Take	the	249	,	add	that	to	cookie	,	249	,	 oop 	 s 	 	,	but	I	see	a	carry	coming	--	249	--	add	that	to	cookie	,	250	plus	77	,	is	327	million	--	 fi 	 s 	 s 	 ion 	 	,	 fi 	 s 	 s 	 ion 	 	,	 O 	 K 	 	,	 final 	 ly 	 	,	we	do	683	 square 	 d 	 	,	that	's	700	 time 	 s 	 	666	,	plus	17	 square 	 d 	 	is	466,489	,	rev	up	if	I	need	it	,	rev	up	,	take	the	466	,	add	that	to	 fi 	 s 	 s 	 ion 	 	,	to	get	,	oh	gee	--	328,489	.
 Audi 	 ence 	 	:	Yeah	!
AB	:	Good	.
Thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
I	hope	you	 enjoy 	 ed 	 	 mathe 	 magic 	 s 	 	.	Thank	you	.
I	'm	 de 	 light 	 ed 	 	to	be	here	.
I	'm	 honor 	 ed 	 	by	the	 invit 	 ation 	 	,	and	 thank 	 s 	 	.
I	would	love	to	talk	about	stuff	that	I	'm	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	,	but	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	I	suspect	that	what	I	'm	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	wo	n't	interest	 man 	 y 	 	other	people	.
First	off	,	my	badge	 say 	 s 	 	I	'm	an	astronomer	.
I	would	love	to	talk	about	my	 astro 	 nomy 	 	,	but	I	suspect	that	the	number	of	people	who	are	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 radi 	 ative 	 	transfer	in	 non 	 - 	 gray 	 	 atmosphere 	 s 	 	and	 polar 	 ization 	 	of	light	in	Jupiter	's	upper	atmosphere	are	the	number	of	people	who	'd	fit	in	a	bus	shelter	.
So	I	'm	not	going	to	talk	about	that	.
It	would	be	just	 a 	 s 	 	much	 f 	 un 	 	to	talk	about	some	stuff	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	1986	and	1987	,	when	a	computer	 hack 	 er 	 	is	 break 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	our	 system 	 s 	 	over	at	 Law 	 rence 	 	 Berk 	 e 	 ley 	 	 Lab 	 s 	 	.
And	I	caught	the	 guy 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	to	be	 work 	 ing 	 	for	what	was	then	the	Soviet	KGB	,	and	 steal 	 ing 	 	information	and	selling	it	.
And	I	'd	love	to	talk	about	that	--	and	it	'd	be	 f 	 un 	 	--	but	,	20	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	...
I	find	computer	security	,	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	to	be	kind	of	 bor 	 ing 	 	.
It	's	 ted 	 ious 	 	.
I	'm	--	The	first	time	you	do	 some 	 thing 	 	,	it	's	science	.
The	second	time	,	it	's	 engineer 	 ing 	 	.
A	third	time	,	it	's	just	 be 	 ing 	 	a	technician	.
I	'm	a	scientist	.	 O 	 nce 	 	I	do	 some 	 thing 	 	,	I	do	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
So	,	I	'm	not	going	to	talk	about	that	.
Nor	am	I	going	to	talk	about	what	I	think	are	obvious	 state 	 ments 	 	from	my	first	book	,	``	Silicon	Snake	Oil	,	''	or	my	second	book	,	nor	am	I	going	to	talk	about	why	I	 believ 	 e 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	do	n't	belong	in	 school 	 s 	 	.
I	feel	that	there	's	a	massive	and	bizarre	idea	going	around	that	we	have	to	 br 	 ing 	 	more	 computer 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 school 	 s 	 	.
My	idea	is	:	no	!	No	!
Get	them	out	of	 school 	 s 	 	,	and	keep	them	out	of	 school 	 s 	 	.
And	I	'd	love	to	talk	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	I	think	the	argument	is	so	obvious	to	 any 	 one 	 	who	's	hung	around	a	fourth	grade	 class 	 room 	 	that	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	need	much	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	--	but	I	guess	I	may	be	 ver 	 y 	 	wrong	about	that	,	and	 every 	 thing 	 	else	that	I	've	 s 	 aid 	 	.
So	do	n't	go	back	and	read	my	 dissert 	 ation 	 	.
It	 prob 	 ably 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	lies	in	it	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
 Hav 	 ing 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	that	,	I	 out 	 lined 	 	my	talk	about	five	 minute 	 s 	 	ago	.
And	if	you	look	at	it	over	here	,	the	main	thing	I	wrote	on	my	thumb	was	the	future	.
I	'm	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	talk	about	the	future	,	 y 	 es 	 	?
Oh	,	right	.	And	my	 feel 	 ing 	 	is	,	 ask 	 ing 	 	me	to	talk	about	the	future	is	bizarre	,	 be 	 cause 	 	I	've	got	gray	hair	,	and	so	,	it	's	kind	of	 s 	 il 	 ly 	 	for	me	to	talk	about	the	future	.
In	fact	,	I	think	that	if	you	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	know	what	the	future	's	going	to	be	,	if	you	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	know	about	the	future	,	do	n't	ask	a	 techno 	 logist 	 	,	a	scientist	,	a	physicist	.
No	!	Do	n't	ask	 some 	 body 	 	who	's	writing	code	.
No	,	if	you	want	to	know	what	 socie 	 ty 	 	's	going	to	be	like	in	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	ask	a	 kind 	 ergarten 	 	teacher	.
 The 	 y 	 	know	.
In	fact	,	do	n't	ask	just	any	 kind 	 ergarten 	 	teacher	,	ask	an	 experience 	 d 	 	one	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	the	 one 	 s 	 	who	know	what	 socie 	 ty 	 	is	going	to	be	like	in	 an 	 other 	 	generation	.
I	do	n't	.	Nor	,	I	suspect	,	do	 man 	 y 	 	other	people	who	are	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	what	the	future	will	 br 	 ing 	 	.
 Certain 	 ly 	 	,	all	of	us	can	imagine	these	cool	new	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	going	to	be	there	.
But	to	me	,	 thing 	 s 	 	are	n't	the	future	.
What	I	ask	 my 	 self 	 	is	,	what	's	 socie 	 ty 	 	is	going	to	be	like	,	when	the	 kid 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	are	 phenomen 	 ally 	 	good	at	text	 mess 	 aging 	 	and	 s 	 pend 	 	a	huge	amount	of	 on 	 - 	 screen 	 	time	,	but	have	never	gone	 bowl 	 ing 	 	together	?
Change	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	,	and	the	change	that	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	is	not	one	that	is	in	 soft 	 ware 	 	.
But	that	's	not	what	I	'm	going	to	talk	about	.
I	'd	love	to	talk	about	it	,	it	'd	be	 f 	 un 	 	,	but	I	want	to	talk	about	what	I	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	now	.	What	am	I	 do 	 ing 	 	now	?
Oh	--	the	other	thing	that	I	think	I	'd	like	to	talk	about	is	right	over	here	.	Right	over	here	.
 I 	 s 	 	that	visible	?	What	I	'd	like	to	talk	about	is	 one 	 - 	 sided 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
I	would	 d 	 early 	 	love	to	talk	about	 thing 	 s 	 	that	have	one	side	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	I	love	 Mo 	 bi 	 us 	 	 loop 	 s 	 	.	I	not	 on 	 ly 	 	love	 Mo 	 bi 	 us 	 	 loop 	 s 	 	,	but	I	'm	one	of	the	 ver 	 y 	 	few	people	,	if	not	the	 on 	 ly 	 	person	in	the	world	,	that	 make 	 s 	 	 Klei 	 n 	 	 bottle 	 s 	 	.
Right	away	,	I	hope	that	all	of	your	 eye 	 s 	 	 glaz 	 e 	 	over	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	 Klei 	 n 	 	bottle	.
For	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	in	the	audience	who	know	,	you	roll	your	 eye 	 s 	 	and	say	,	 y 	 up 	 	,	I	know	all	about	it	.
It	's	one	sided	.	It	's	a	bottle	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	 in 	 side 	 	is	 it 	 s 	 	 out 	 side 	 	.
It	 ha 	 s 	 	zero	volume	.	And	it	's	 non 	 - 	 orient 	 able 	 	.
It	 ha 	 s 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 proper 	 ties 	 	.
If	you	take	two	 Mo 	 bi 	 us 	 	 loop 	 s 	 	and	sew	 the 	 ir 	 	common	edge	together	,	you	get	one	of	these	,	and	I	make	them	out	of	glass	.
And	I	'd	love	to	talk	to	you	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	I	do	n't	have	much	in	the	way	of	...	 thing 	 s 	 	to	say	 be 	 cause 	 	--	 How 	 ever 	 	,	the	``	D	''	in	TED	of	course	 stand 	 s 	 	for	design	.
Just	two	 week 	 s 	 	ago	I	made	--	you	know	,	I	've	 be 	 en 	 	making	small	,	medium	and	big	 Klei 	 n 	 	 bottle 	 s 	 	for	the	trade	.
But	what	I	've	just	made	--	and	I	'm	 de 	 light 	 ed 	 	to	show	you	,	first	time	in	public	here	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	 Klei 	 n 	 	bottle	wine	bottle	,	which	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	in	four	 dimension 	 s 	 	it	should	n't	be	able	to	hold	any	fluid	at	all	,	it	's	 perfect 	 ly 	 	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 do 	 ing 	 	so	 be 	 cause 	 	our	 uni 	 verse 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	three	spatial	 dimension 	 s 	 	.
And	 be 	 cause 	 	our	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	 on 	 ly 	 	three	spatial	 dimension 	 s 	 	,	it	can	hold	 fluid 	 s 	 	.
So	it	's	 high 	 ly 	 	--	that	one	's	the	cool	one	.
That	was	a	month	of	my	life	.
But	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	I	would	love	to	talk	about	 top 	 ology 	 	with	you	,	I	'm	not	going	to	.
 In 	 stead 	 	,	I	'm	going	to	 ment 	 ion 	 	my	mom	,	who	 pass 	 ed 	 	away	last	summer	.
Had	 collect 	 ed 	 	 photograph 	 s 	 	of	me	,	 a 	 s 	 	 mother 	 s 	 	will	do	.
 Cou 	 ld 	 	 some 	 body 	 	put	 th 	 is 	 	guy	up	?
And	I	 look 	 ed 	 	over	her	 al 	 bum 	 	and	she	had	 collect 	 ed 	 	a	picture	of	me	,	 stand 	 ing 	 	--	well	,	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	--	in	1969	,	in	front	of	a	bunch	of	 dial 	 s 	 	.
And	I	 look 	 ed 	 	at	it	,	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	oh	my	god	,	that	was	me	,	when	I	was	 work 	 ing 	 	at	the	 electron 	 ic 	 	music	studio	!
 A 	 s 	 	a	technician	,	 repair 	 ing 	 	and	 maintain 	 ing 	 	the	 electron 	 ic 	 	music	studio	at	 S 	 UN 	 Y 	 	Buffalo	.	And	 w 	 ow 	 	!
Way	back	machine	.	And	I	 s 	 aid 	 	to	 my 	 self 	 	,	oh	 yea 	 h 	 	!
And	it	 s 	 ent 	 	me	back	.
Soon	after	that	,	I	found	in	 an 	 other 	 	picture	that	she	had	,	a	picture	of	me	.
 Th 	 is 	 	guy	over	here	of	course	is	me	.
 Th 	 is 	 	man	is	 Ro 	 bert 	 	 Mo 	 og 	 	,	the	inventor	of	the	 Mo 	 og 	 	 synthesize 	 r 	 	,	who	 pass 	 ed 	 	away	 th 	 is 	 	past	 Au 	 gust 	 	.
 Ro 	 bert 	 	 Mo 	 og 	 	was	a	 gen 	 er 	 ous 	 	,	kind	person	,	 extra 	 ordinari 	 ly 	 	 compete 	 nt 	 	engineer	.
A	 music 	 ian 	 	who	took	time	from	his	life	to	teach	me	,	a	 s 	 op 	 homo 	 re 	 	,	a	 fresh 	 man 	 	at	 S 	 UN 	 Y 	 	Buffalo	.
He	'd	come	up	from	 Tru 	 man 	 s 	 burg 	 	to	teach	me	not	just	about	the	 Mo 	 og 	 	 synthesize 	 r 	 	,	but	we	'd	be	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	--	I	'm	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	physics	at	the	time	.	 Th 	 is 	 	is	1969	,	70	,	71	.
We	're	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	physics	,	I	'm	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	physics	,	and	he	's	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	That	's	a	good	thing	to	do	.
Do	n't	get	caught	up	in	 electron 	 ic 	 	music	if	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	physics	.	''
 Men 	 tor 	 ing 	 	me	.	He	'd	come	up	and	 s 	 pend 	 	 hour 	 s 	 	and	 hour 	 s 	 	with	me	.
He	wrote	a	letter	of	 recommend 	 ation 	 	for	me	to	get	 in 	 to 	 	graduate	school	.
In	the	 back 	 ground 	 	,	my	 bi 	 cycle 	 	.
I	 real 	 ize 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	picture	was	taken	at	a	friend	's	living	room	.
Bob	 Mo 	 og 	 	came	by	and	 haul 	 ed 	 	a	whole	pile	of	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	to	show	 G 	 re 	 g 	 	 F 	 lint 	 	and	I	 thing 	 s 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
We	 s 	 at 	 	around	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 Four 	 ier 	 	 transform 	 s 	 	,	 Bess 	 el 	 	 function 	 s 	 	,	 modul 	 ation 	 	transfer	 function 	 s 	 	,	stuff	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
Bob	's	 pass 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	past	summer	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	loss	to	all	of	us	.
 Any 	 one 	 	who	's	a	 music 	 ian 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 pro 	 found 	 ly 	 	 influence 	 d 	 	by	 Ro 	 bert 	 	 Mo 	 og 	 	.
And	I	'll	just	say	what	I	'm	about	to	do	.	What	I	'm	about	to	do	--	I	hope	you	can	 recogn 	 ize 	 	that	there	's	a	 distort 	 ed 	 	 s 	 ine 	 	wave	,	 al 	 most 	 	a	 tri 	 angular 	 	wave	 up 	 on 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 Hewlett 	 - 	 Pack 	 ard 	 	 oscill 	 o 	 scope 	 	.
Oh	,	cool	.	I	can	get	to	 th 	 is 	 	place	over	here	,	right	?
 Kid 	 s 	 	.	 Kid 	 s 	 	is	what	I	'm	going	to	talk	about	--	is	that	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	?
It	 say 	 s 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	over	here	,	that	's	what	I	'd	like	to	talk	about	.
I	've	 decide 	 d 	 	that	,	for	me	at	 l 	 east 	 	,	I	do	n't	have	a	big	 en 	 ough 	 	head	.
So	I	think	 local 	 ly 	 	and	I	act	 local 	 ly 	 	.
I	feel	that	the	best	way	I	can	help	out	 any 	 thing 	 	is	to	help	out	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 local 	 ly 	 	.
So	 Ph.D 	 . 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	degree	there	,	and	the	yadda	yadda	.
I	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	to	some	 school 	 teacher 	 s 	 	about	a	year	ago	.
And	one	of	them	,	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	of	them	would	come	up	to	me	and	say	,	``	Well	,	how	come	you	ai	n't	 teach 	 ing 	 	?	''
And	I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Well	,	I	've	taught	graduate	--	I	've	had	graduate	 student 	 s 	 	,	I	've	taught	 under 	 graduate 	 	 class 	 es 	 	.	''
No	,	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	If	you	're	so	 in 	 to 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	and	all	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	,	how	come	you	ai	n't	over	here	on	the	front	lines	?
Put	your	money	where	you	mouth	is	.	''
 I 	 s 	 	true	.	 I 	 s 	 	true	.	I	teach	 eighth 	 - 	 grade 	 	science	four	 day 	 s 	 	a	week	.
Not	just	 show 	 ing 	 	up	every	now	and	then	.
No	,	no	,	no	,	no	,	no	.	I	take	 attend 	 ance 	 	.
I	take	lunch	hour	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	not	--	no	,	no	,	no	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	 clap 	 s 	 	.
I	 strong 	 ly 	 	suggest	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	good	thing	for	each	of	you	to	do	.
Not	just	show	up	to	class	every	now	and	then	.
Teach	a	solid	week	.	 Oka 	 y 	 	,	I	'm	 teach 	 ing 	 	 three 	 - 	 quarter 	 s 	 	time	,	but	good	 en 	 ough 	 	.
One	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	I	've	 d 	 one 	 	for	my	science	 student 	 s 	 	is	to	tell	them	,	``	Look	,	I	'm	going	to	teach	you	 college 	 - 	 level 	 	physics	.
No	 calcul 	 us 	 	,	I	'll	cut	out	that	.
You	wo	n't	need	to	know	 t 	 rig 	 	.
But	you	will	need	to	know	 eighth 	 - 	 grade 	 	algebra	,	and	we	're	going	to	do	serious	 experiment 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 one 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 open 	 - 	 to 	 - 	 chapter 	 - 	 seven 	 - 	 and 	 - 	 do 	 - 	 all 	 - 	 the 	 - 	 odd 	 - 	 problem 	 - 	 set 	 s 	 	.
We	're	going	to	be	 do 	 ing 	 	genuine	physics	.	''
And	that	's	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	I	thought	I	'd	do	right	now	.
Oh	,	before	I	even	turn	that	on	,	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	did	about	three	 week 	 s 	 	ago	in	my	class	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	through	the	lens	,	and	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	used	a	lens	for	was	to	measure	the	speed	of	light	.
My	 student 	 s 	 	in	El	Cerrito	--	with	my	help	,	of	course	,	and	with	the	help	of	a	 ver 	 y 	 	beat	up	 oscill 	 o 	 scope 	 	--	 measur 	 ed 	 	the	speed	of	light	.
We	 we 	 re 	 	off	by	25	percent	.	How	 man 	 y 	 	eighth	graders	do	you	know	of	who	have	 measur 	 ed 	 	the	speed	of	light	?
In	 add 	 ition 	 	to	that	,	we	've	 measur 	 ed 	 	the	speed	of	sound	.
I	'd	love	to	measure	the	speed	of	light	here	.
I	was	all	set	to	do	it	and	I	was	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	Aw	man	,	''	I	was	just	going	to	impose	 up 	 on 	 	the	 power 	 s 	 	that	be	,	and	measure	the	speed	of	light	.
And	I	'm	all	set	to	do	it	.	I	'm	all	set	to	do	it	,	but	then	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	to	set	up	here	,	you	have	like	10	 minute 	 s 	 	to	set	up	!
And	there	's	no	time	to	do	it	.
So	,	next	time	,	 may 	 be 	 	,	I	'll	measure	the	speed	of	light	!
But	 mean 	 while 	 	,	let	's	measure	the	speed	of	sound	!
Well	,	the	obvious	way	to	measure	the	speed	of	sound	is	to	 bounc 	 e 	 	sound	off	 some 	 thing 	 	and	look	at	the	echo	.
But	,	 prob 	 ably 	 	--	one	of	my	 student 	 s 	 	,	Ariel	[	 un 	 clear 	 	]	,	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 Cou 	 ld 	 	we	measure	the	speed	of	light	using	the	wave	 equ 	 ation 	 	?	''
And	all	of	you	know	the	wave	 equ 	 ation 	 	is	the	frequency	 time 	 s 	 	the	 wave 	 length 	 	of	any	wave	...
is	a	constant	.	When	the	frequency	 go 	 es 	 	up	,	the	 wave 	 length 	 	 come 	 s 	 	down	.	 W 	 ave 	 length 	 	 go 	 es 	 	up	,	frequency	 go 	 es 	 	down	.	So	,	if	we	have	a	wave	here	--	over	here	,	that	's	what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	the	pitch	 go 	 es 	 	up	,	 thing 	 s 	 	get	 close 	 r 	 	,	pitch	 go 	 es 	 	down	,	 thing 	 s 	 	stretch	out	.
Right	?	 Th 	 is 	 	is	simple	physics	.
All	of	you	know	 th 	 is 	 	from	eighth	grade	,	remember	?
What	they	did	n't	tell	you	in	physics	--	in	 eighth 	 - 	 grade 	 	physics	--	but	they	should	have	,	and	I	wish	they	had	,	was	that	if	you	 multi 	 ply 	 	the	frequency	 time 	 s 	 	the	 wave 	 length 	 	of	sound	or	light	,	you	get	a	constant	.
And	that	constant	is	the	speed	of	sound	.
So	,	in	order	to	measure	the	speed	of	sound	,	all	I	've	got	to	do	is	know	 it 	 s 	 	frequency	.	Well	,	that	's	easy	.
I	've	got	a	frequency	counter	right	here	.
Set	it	up	to	around	A	,	above	A	,	above	A	.	There	's	an	A	,	more	or	less	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	so	I	know	the	frequency	.
It	's	1.76	 kilo 	 hertz 	 	.	I	measure	 it 	 s 	 	 wave 	 length 	 	.
All	I	need	now	is	to	flip	on	 an 	 other 	 	beam	,	and	the	bottom	beam	is	me	 talk 	 ing 	 	,	right	?
So	 any 	 time 	 	I	talk	,	you	'd	see	it	on	the	screen	.
I	'll	put	it	over	here	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	I	move	 th 	 is 	 	away	from	the	source	,	you	'll	notice	the	spiral	.
The	 s 	 link 	 y 	 	 move 	 s 	 	.	We	're	going	through	different	 nod 	 es 	 	of	the	wave	,	coming	out	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
 T 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	are	 physicist 	 s 	 	,	I	hear	you	 roll 	 ing 	 	your	 eye 	 s 	 	,	but	bear	with	me	.
To	measure	the	 wave 	 length 	 	,	all	I	need	to	do	is	measure	the	distance	from	here	--	one	full	wave	--	over	to	here	.
From	here	to	here	is	the	 wave 	 length 	 	of	sound	.
So	,	I	'll	put	a	 measur 	 ing 	 	tape	here	,	 measur 	 ing 	 	tape	here	,	move	it	back	over	to	here	.
I	've	 move 	 d 	 	the	 micro 	 phone 	 	20	 centimeter 	 s 	 	.
0.2	 meter 	 s 	 	from	here	,	back	to	here	,	20	 centimeter 	 s 	 	.
 O 	 K 	 	,	let	's	go	back	to	 Mr 	 . 	 	 Elm 	 o 	 	.
And	we	'll	say	the	frequency	is	1.76	 kilo 	 hertz 	 	,	or	1760	.
The	 wave 	 length 	 	was	0.2	 meter 	 s 	 	.
Let	's	figure	out	what	 th 	 is 	 	is	.
1.76	 time 	 s 	 	0.2	over	here	is	352	 meter 	 s 	 	per	second	.
If	you	look	it	up	in	the	book	,	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	343	.
But	,	here	with	kludgy	material	,	and	 lous 	 y 	 	drink	--	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	measure	the	speed	of	sound	to	--	not	bad	.	 Pre 	 tty 	 	good	.
All	of	which	 come 	 s 	 	to	what	I	 want 	 ed 	 	to	say	.
Go	back	to	 th 	 is 	 	picture	of	me	a	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
It	was	1971	,	the	Vietnam	War	was	going	on	,	and	I	'm	like	,	``	Oh	my	God	!	''
I	'm	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	physics	:	 Land 	 au 	 	,	 Lip 	 sch 	 itz 	 	,	 Re 	 s 	 nick 	 	and	 H 	 al 	 liday 	 	.
I	'm	going	home	for	a	 mid 	 term 	 	.	A	riot	's	going	on	on	campus	.
There	's	a	riot	!	Hey	,	 Elm 	 o 	 	's	 d 	 one 	 	:	off	.
There	's	a	riot	going	on	on	campus	,	and	the	police	are	chasing	me	,	right	?
I	'm	 walk 	 ing 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	campus	.	Cop	 come 	 s 	 	and	 look 	 s 	 	at	me	and	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	You	!	You	're	a	student	.	''
 Pull 	 s 	 	out	a	gun	.	 Go 	 es 	 	boom	!
And	a	tear	gas	 can 	 ist 	 er 	 	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	a	Pepsi	can	 go 	 es 	 	by	my	head	.	 Whoo 	 sh 	 	!
I	get	a	breath	of	tear	gas	and	I	ca	n't	breathe	.
 Th 	 is 	 	cop	 come 	 s 	 	after	me	with	a	rifle	.
He	 want 	 s 	 	to	clunk	me	over	the	head	!
I	'm	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	I	got	to	clear	out	of	here	!	''
I	go	running	 a 	 cross 	 	campus	quick	 a 	 s 	 	I	can	.	I	duck	 in 	 to 	 	 Hay 	 es 	 	Hall	.
It	's	one	of	these	 bell 	 - 	 tower 	 	 building 	 s 	 	.
The	cop	's	chasing	me	.
 Cha 	 s 	 ing 	 	me	up	the	first	floor	,	second	floor	,	third	floor	.
 Cha 	 s 	 es 	 	me	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	room	.
The	 en 	 trance 	 way 	 	to	the	bell	tower	.
I	 s 	 lam 	 	the	door	 be 	 hind 	 	me	,	climb	up	,	go	past	 th 	 is 	 	place	where	I	see	a	pendulum	 tick 	 ing 	 	.
And	I	'm	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	Oh	 yea 	 h 	 	,	the	square	root	of	the	length	is	 proportion 	 al 	 	to	 it 	 s 	 	period	.	''
I	keep	 climb 	 ing 	 	up	,	go	back	.
I	go	to	a	place	where	a	 do 	 wel 	 	 split 	 s 	 	off	.
There	's	a	clock	,	clock	,	clock	,	clock	.
The	time	's	going	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	I	'm	 in 	 side 	 	of	it	.
I	'm	 think 	 ing 	 	of	Lorenz	 contract 	 ions 	 	and	 Einstein 	 ian 	 	 relat 	 ivity 	 	.
I	climb	up	,	and	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	place	,	way	in	the	back	,	that	you	climb	up	 th 	 is 	 	 wood 	 en 	 	 lad 	 der 	 	.
I	pop	up	the	top	,	and	there	's	a	cupola	.
A	 dom 	 e 	 	,	one	of	these	 ten 	 - 	 foot 	 	 dom 	 es 	 	.
I	'm	looking	out	and	I	'm	 see 	 ing 	 	the	 cop 	 s 	 	 bash 	 ing 	 	 student 	 s 	 	'	 head 	 s 	 	,	 shoot 	 ing 	 	tear	gas	,	and	 watch 	 ing 	 	 student 	 s 	 	 throw 	 ing 	 	 brick 	 s 	 	.
And	I	'm	 ask 	 ing 	 	,	``	What	am	I	 do 	 ing 	 	here	?	Why	am	I	here	?	''
 Th 	 en 	 	I	remember	what	my	English	teacher	in	high	school	 s 	 aid 	 	.
 Name 	 ly 	 	,	that	when	they	cast	 bell 	 s 	 	,	they	write	 in 	 script 	 ions 	 	on	them	.
So	,	I	wipe	the	pigeon	 man 	 ure 	 	off	one	of	the	 bell 	 s 	 	,	and	I	look	at	it	.
I	'm	 ask 	 ing 	 	 my 	 self 	 	,	``	Why	am	I	here	?	''
So	,	at	 th 	 is 	 	time	,	I	'd	like	to	tell	you	the	 word 	 s 	 	 in 	 scribed 	 	 up 	 on 	 	the	 Hay 	 es 	 	Hall	tower	 bell 	 s 	 	:	``	All	truth	is	one	.

It	is	the	voice	of	life	,	which	 call 	 s 	 	us	to	come	and	learn	.	''
Thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
What	's	in	the	box	?
 What 	 ever 	 	it	is	must	be	 pre 	 tty 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	I	've	 travel 	 ed 	 	with	it	,	 move 	 d 	 	it	,	from	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	to	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	to	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	.
Sound	familiar	?
Did	you	know	that	we	 American 	 s 	 	have	about	three	 time 	 s 	 	the	amount	of	space	we	did	50	 year 	 s 	 	ago	?
Three	 time 	 s 	 	.
So	you	'd	think	,	with	all	 th 	 is 	 	extra	space	,	we	'd	have	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	room	for	all	our	stuff	.
 No 	 pe 	 	.
There	's	a	new	industry	in	town	,	a	22	 billion 	 - 	 dollar 	 	,	2.2	billion	sq	.	ft.	industry	:	that	of	personal	 s 	 to 	 rage 	 	.
So	we	've	got	triple	the	space	,	but	we	've	 be 	 come 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	good	 s 	 hopper 	 s 	 	that	we	need	even	more	space	.
So	where	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	lead	?
 Lot 	 s 	 	of	credit	card	debt	,	huge	 environment 	 al 	 	 foot 	 print 	 s 	 	,	and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	not	 co 	 incident 	 ally 	 	,	our	happiness	 level 	 s 	 	 flat 	 - 	 lined 	 	over	the	same	50	 year 	 s 	 	.
Well	I	'm	here	to	suggest	there	's	a	better	way	,	that	less	might	 actual 	 ly 	 	equal	more	.
I	bet	most	of	us	have	 experience 	 d 	 	at	some	point	the	 joy 	 s 	 	of	less	:	college	--	in	your	dorm	,	 travel 	 ing 	 	--	in	a	hotel	room	,	 camp 	 ing 	 	--	rig	up	 bas 	 ically 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	a	boat	.
 What 	 ever 	 	it	was	for	you	,	I	bet	that	,	among	other	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	you	a	little	more	 free 	 dom 	 	,	a	little	more	time	.
So	I	'm	going	to	suggest	that	less	stuff	and	less	space	are	going	to	equal	a	 small 	 er 	 	 foot 	 print 	 	.
It	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	great	way	to	 s 	 ave 	 	you	some	money	.
And	it	's	going	to	give	you	a	little	more	ease	in	your	life	.
So	I	 start 	 ed 	 	a	project	 call 	 ed 	 	Life	 Edi 	 ted 	 	at	 life 	 edit 	 ed 	 .org 	 	to	further	 th 	 is 	 	conversation	and	to	find	some	great	 solution 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	area	.
First	up	:	 crowd 	 - 	 sourcing 	 	my	420	sq	.	ft.	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	in	 Man 	 hat 	 tan 	 	with	 partner 	 s 	 	 Mu 	 topo 	 	and	 Jo 	 vot 	 o 	 .com 	 	.
I	 want 	 ed 	 	it	all	--	home	 off 	 ice 	 	,	 s 	 it 	 	down	 d 	 inner 	 	for	10	,	room	for	 guest 	 s 	 	,	and	all	my	kite	surfing	gear	.
With	over	300	 ent 	 ries 	 	from	around	the	world	,	I	got	it	,	my	own	little	jewel	box	.
By	 buy 	 ing 	 	a	space	that	was	420	sq	.	ft	.
 in 	 stead 	 	of	600	,	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	I	'm	saving	200	grand	.
 Small 	 er 	 	space	is	going	to	make	for	 small 	 er 	 	 util 	 ities 	 	--	 s 	 ave 	 	some	more	money	there	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	a	 small 	 er 	 	 foot 	 print 	 	.
And	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	designed	around	an	 edit 	 ed 	 	set	of	 possess 	 ions 	 	--	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	stuff	--	and	 re 	 ally 	 	designed	for	me	,	I	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	to	be	there	.
So	how	can	you	live	little	?
Three	main	 approach 	 es 	 	.
First	of	all	,	you	have	to	edit	 ruth 	 lessly 	 	.
We	've	got	to	clear	the	 arteri 	 es 	 	of	our	 live 	 s 	 	.
And	that	shirt	that	I	had	n't	worn	in	 year 	 s 	 	?
It	's	time	for	me	to	let	it	go	.
We	've	got	to	cut	the	 extra 	 ne 	 ous 	 	out	of	our	 live 	 s 	 	,	and	we	've	got	to	learn	to	stem	the	 in 	 flow 	 	.
We	need	to	think	before	we	buy	.
Ask	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	``	 I 	 s 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	going	to	make	me	 hap 	 pi 	 er 	 	?	 Tru 	 ly 	 	?	''
By	all	 mean 	 s 	 	,	we	should	buy	and	own	some	great	stuff	.
But	we	want	stuff	that	we	're	going	to	love	for	 year 	 s 	 	,	not	just	stuff	.
 Second 	 ly 	 	,	our	new	 man 	 tra 	 	:	small	is	sexy	.
We	want	space	efficiency	.
We	want	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	designed	for	how	they	're	used	the	vast	 major 	 ity 	 	of	the	time	,	not	that	rare	event	.
Why	have	a	six	 burn 	 er 	 	stove	when	you	 rare 	 ly 	 	use	three	?
So	we	want	 thing 	 s 	 	that	nest	,	we	want	 thing 	 s 	 	that	stack	,	and	we	want	it	 digit 	 ized 	 	.
You	can	take	 paper 	 work 	 	,	 book 	 s 	 	,	 movie 	 s 	 	,	and	you	can	make	it	disappear	--	it	's	magic	.
 Fin 	 ally 	 	,	we	want	 multi 	 functional 	 	 space 	 s 	 	and	 house 	 ware 	 s 	 	--	a	sink	 combine 	 d 	 	with	a	toilet	,	a	 din 	 ing 	 	table	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	bed	--	same	space	,	a	little	side	table	 stretch 	 es 	 	out	to	seat	10	.
In	the	winning	Life	 Edi 	 ted 	 	scheme	in	a	render	here	,	we	combine	a	moving	wall	with	 transform 	 er 	 	furniture	to	get	a	lot	out	of	the	space	.
Look	at	the	coffee	table	--	it	 grow 	 s 	 	in	height	and	width	to	seat	10	.
My	 off 	 ice 	 	 fold 	 s 	 	away	,	 eas 	 ily 	 	 hid 	 den 	 	.
My	bed	just	 pop 	 s 	 	out	of	the	wall	with	two	 finger 	 s 	 	.
 Gue 	 st 	 s 	 	?	Move	the	moving	wall	,	have	some	 fold 	 - 	 down 	 	guest	 bed 	 s 	 	.
And	of	course	,	my	own	movie	theater	.
So	I	'm	not	 say 	 ing 	 	that	we	all	need	to	live	in	420	sq	.	ft	.
But	consider	the	 benefit 	 s 	 	of	an	 edit 	 ed 	 	life	.
Go	from	3,000	to	2,000	,	from	1,500	to	1,000	.
 Mo 	 st 	 	of	us	,	 may 	 be 	 	all	of	us	,	are	here	 pre 	 tty 	 	 hap 	 pi 	 ly 	 	for	a	bunch	of	 day 	 s 	 	with	a	couple	of	 bag 	 s 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	a	small	space	,	a	hotel	room	.
So	when	you	go	home	and	you	walk	through	your	front	door	,	take	a	second	and	ask	 your 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	``	 Cou 	 ld 	 	I	do	with	a	little	life	 edit 	 ing 	 	?
Would	that	give	me	a	little	more	 free 	 dom 	 	?
 May 	 be 	 	a	little	more	time	?	''
What	's	in	the	box	?
It	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	matter	.
I	know	I	do	n't	need	it	.
What	's	in	 your 	 s 	 	?
 May 	 be 	 	,	just	 may 	 be 	 	,	less	might	equal	more	.
So	let	's	make	room	for	the	good	stuff	.
Thank	you	.
So	,	here	we	go	:	a	 fly 	 by 	 	of	play	.
It	's	got	to	be	serious	if	the	New	York	 Time 	 s 	 	 put 	 s 	 	a	cover	story	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 Fe 	 br 	 uary 	 	17th	 Sun 	 day 	 	magazine	about	play	.
At	the	bottom	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	it	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	It	's	 deep 	 er 	 	than	gender	.
 S 	 er 	 iously 	 	,	but	 danger 	 ously 	 	 f 	 un 	 	.
And	a	 sand 	 box 	 	for	new	 idea 	 s 	 	about	evolution	.	''
Not	bad	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	if	you	look	at	that	cover	,	what	's	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	?
You	see	any	 adult 	 s 	 	?
Well	,	lets	go	back	to	the	15th	century	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	 court 	 yard 	 	in	 Euro 	 pe 	 	,	and	a	 mix 	 ture 	 	of	124	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	play	.
All	 age 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 olo 	 	play	,	body	play	,	 game 	 s 	 	,	 taunt 	 ing 	 	.
And	there	it	is	.	And	I	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	typical	picture	of	what	it	was	like	in	a	 court 	 yard 	 	then	.
I	think	we	may	have	lost	 some 	 thing 	 	in	our	culture	.
So	I	'm	gon	na	take	you	through	what	I	think	is	a	 remark 	 able 	 	sequence	.
North	of	 Church 	 ill 	 	,	 Man 	 ito 	 ba 	 	,	in	 Oct 	 ob 	 er 	 	and	 Nove 	 mb 	 er 	 	,	there	's	no	ice	on	 Hu 	 d 	 son 	 	Bay	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	polar	bear	that	you	see	,	 th 	 is 	 	1200-pound	male	,	he	's	wild	and	 fair 	 ly 	 	 hung 	 ry 	 	.
And	 Nor 	 bert 	 	 Ro 	 s 	 ing 	 	,	a	German	 photograph 	 er 	 	,	is	there	on	scene	,	making	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 photo 	 s 	 	of	these	 husk 	 ies 	 	,	who	are	 tether 	 ed 	 	.
And	from	out	of	stage	left	 come 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	wild	,	male	polar	bear	,	with	a	 predator 	 y 	 	 gaz 	 e 	 	.
Any	of	you	who	've	 be 	 en 	 	to	 Afri 	 ca 	 	or	had	a	 junk 	 yard 	 	dog	come	after	you	,	there	is	a	 fix 	 ed 	 	kind	of	 predator 	 y 	 	 gaz 	 e 	 	that	you	know	you	're	in	trouble	.
But	on	the	other	side	of	that	 predator 	 y 	 	 gaz 	 e 	 	is	a	female	 husk 	 y 	 	in	a	play	bow	,	 wagg 	 ing 	 	her	tail	.
And	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 usual 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	.
That	 fix 	 ed 	 	behavior	--	which	is	rigid	and	 stereo 	 type 	 d 	 	and	 end 	 s 	 	up	with	a	meal	--	 change 	 s 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	polar	bear	 stand 	 s 	 	over	the	 husk 	 y 	 	,	no	 claw 	 s 	 	 extend 	 ed 	 	,	no	 fang 	 s 	 	taking	a	look	.
And	they	begin	an	 in 	 credible 	 	ballet	.
A	play	ballet	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	in	nature	:	it	 over 	 ride 	 s 	 	a	 car 	 ni 	 vor 	 ous 	 	nature	and	what	 other 	 wise 	 	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	a	short	fight	to	the	death	.
And	if	you	'll	begin	to	look	 close 	 ly 	 	at	the	 husk 	 y 	 	that	's	 bear 	 ing 	 	her	throat	to	the	polar	bear	,	and	look	a	little	more	 close 	 ly 	 	,	they	're	in	an	 alter 	 ed 	 	state	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	in	a	state	of	play	.
And	it	's	that	state	that	 allow 	 s 	 	these	two	 creature 	 s 	 	to	explore	the	possible	.
 The 	 y 	 	are	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 n 	 either 	 	would	have	 d 	 one 	 	 with 	 out 	 	the	play	 signal 	 s 	 	.
And	it	is	a	 marvel 	 ous 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	how	a	 different 	 ial 	 	in	power	can	be	 over 	 ridden 	 	by	a	process	of	nature	that	's	 with 	 in 	 	all	of	us	.
 N 	 ow 	 	how	did	I	get	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	?
John	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	that	I	've	 d 	 one 	 	some	work	with	 murder 	 ers 	 	,	and	I	have	.
The	Texas	Tower	 murder 	 er 	 	 open 	 ed 	 	my	 eye 	 s 	 	,	in	retrospect	,	when	we	 stud 	 ied 	 	his	tragic	mass	murder	,	to	the	 import 	 ance 	 	of	play	,	in	that	that	individual	,	by	deep	 stud 	 y 	 	,	was	found	to	have	severe	play	 depriv 	 ation 	 	.
 Char 	 les 	 	 Whi 	 t 	 man 	 	was	his	name	.
And	our	 commit 	 tee 	 	,	which	 consist 	 ed 	 	of	a	lot	of	hard	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	did	feel	at	the	end	of	that	 stud 	 y 	 	that	the	 ab 	 s 	 ence 	 	of	play	and	a	 progress 	 ive 	 	 suppress 	 ion 	 	of	 develop 	 ment 	 ally 	 	normal	play	led	him	to	be	more	 vulner 	 able 	 	to	the	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	that	he	 perpet 	 rated 	 	.
And	that	 find 	 ing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	stood	the	test	of	time	--	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	even	 in 	 to 	 	more	 re 	 cent 	 	 time 	 s 	 	,	at	 Virgin 	 ia 	 	Tech	.
And	other	 stud 	 ies 	 	of	 population 	 s 	 	at	risk	sensitized	me	to	the	 import 	 ance 	 	of	play	,	but	I	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	understand	what	it	was	.
And	it	was	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	in	taking	play	 histo 	 ries 	 	of	 individual 	 s 	 	before	I	 re 	 ally 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	to	 recogn 	 ize 	 	that	I	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	have	a	full	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	it	.
And	I	do	n't	think	any	of	us	 ha 	 s 	 	a	full	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	it	,	by	any	 mean 	 s 	 	.
But	there	are	ways	of	looking	at	it	that	I	think	can	give	you	--	give	us	all	a	 tax 	 o 	 nomy 	 	,	a	way	of	 think 	 ing 	 	about	it	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	image	is	,	for	 human 	 s 	 	,	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	point	of	play	.
When	that	mother	and	infant	lock	 eye 	 s 	 	,	and	the	infant	's	old	 en 	 ough 	 	to	have	a	social	 s 	 mile 	 	,	what	 happen 	 s 	 	--	 spontane 	 ously 	 	--	is	the	 erupt 	 ion 	 	of	joy	on	the	part	of	the	mother	.
And	she	 begin 	 s 	 	to	 ba 	 bble 	 	and	coo	and	 s 	 mile 	 	,	and	so	 do 	 es 	 	the	baby	.
If	we	've	got	them	wired	up	with	an	 electro 	 encephalo 	 gram 	 	,	the	right	brain	of	each	of	them	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 at 	 tuned 	 	,	so	that	the	 joy 	 ful 	 	emergence	of	 th 	 is 	 	 ear 	 liest 	 	of	play	 scene 	 s 	 	and	the	physiology	of	that	is	 some 	 thing 	 	we	're	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	get	a	handle	on	.
And	I	'd	like	you	to	think	that	every	bit	of	more	complex	play	 build 	 s 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	base	for	us	 human 	 s 	 	.
And	so	now	I	'm	going	to	take	you	through	sort	of	a	way	of	looking	at	play	,	but	it	's	never	just	 s 	 ing 	 ular 	 ly 	 	one	thing	.
We	're	going	to	look	at	body	play	,	which	is	a	 spontane 	 ous 	 	 desir 	 e 	 	to	get	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	out	of	 gravit 	 y 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	mountain	goat	.
If	you	're	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	bad	day	,	try	 th 	 is 	 	:	jump	up	and	down	,	 wig 	 gle 	 	around	--	you	're	going	to	feel	better	.
And	you	may	feel	like	 th 	 is 	 	character	,	who	is	 al 	 so 	 	just	 do 	 ing 	 	it	for	 it 	 s 	 	own	sake	.
It	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	a	 part 	 icular 	 	purpose	,	and	that	's	what	's	great	about	play	.
If	 it 	 s 	 	purpose	is	more	 import 	 ant 	 	than	the	act	of	 do 	 ing 	 	it	,	it	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	not	play	.
And	there	's	a	whole	other	type	of	play	,	which	is	object	play	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	 Japan 	 ese 	 	 maca 	 que 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	made	a	 snow 	 ball 	 	,	and	he	or	she	's	going	to	roll	down	a	hill	.
And	--	they	do	n't	throw	it	at	each	other	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	fundamental	part	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 play 	 ful 	 	.
The	human	hand	,	in	 manipul 	 ation 	 	of	 object 	 s 	 	,	is	the	hand	in	search	of	a	brain	;	the	brain	is	in	search	of	a	hand	;	and	play	is	the	medium	by	which	 t 	 hose 	 	two	are	linked	in	the	best	way	.
 JP 	 L 	 	we	heard	 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	--	 JP 	 L 	 	is	an	 in 	 credible 	 	place	.
 The 	 y 	 	have	 locate 	 d 	 	two	 consult 	 ants 	 	,	Frank	 Wil 	 son 	 	and	 N 	 ate 	 	 John 	 son 	 	,	who	are	--	Frank	 Wil 	 son 	 	is	a	 neuro 	 logist 	 	,	 N 	 ate 	 	 John 	 son 	 	is	a	mechanic	.
He	taught	 mechanic 	 s 	 	in	a	high	school	in	Long	 Be 	 ach 	 	,	and	found	that	his	 student 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	no	 long 	 er 	 	able	to	solve	 problem 	 s 	 	.
And	he	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	figure	out	why	.	And	he	came	to	the	 con 	 clusion 	 	,	 quit 	 e 	 	on	his	own	,	that	the	 student 	 s 	 	who	could	no	 long 	 er 	 	solve	 problem 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 fix 	 ing 	 	 car 	 s 	 	,	had	n't	 work 	 ed 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	.
Frank	 Wil 	 son 	 	had	written	a	book	 call 	 ed 	 	``	The	Hand	.	''
 The 	 y 	 	got	together	--	 JP 	 L 	 	 hire 	 d 	 	them	.
 N 	 ow 	 	 JP 	 L 	 	,	 NAS 	 A 	 	and	 Bo 	 e 	 ing 	 	,	before	they	will	hire	a	research	and	 develop 	 ment 	 	problem	 solve 	 r 	 	--	even	if	they	're	 summ 	 a 	 	cum	 la 	 ude 	 	from	Harvard	or	Cal	Tech	--	if	they	have	n't	 fix 	 ed 	 	 car 	 s 	 	,	have	n't	 d 	 one 	 	stuff	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	early	in	life	,	 play 	 ed 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	,	they	ca	n't	 problem 	 - 	 solve 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
So	play	is	practical	,	and	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	about	play	is	that	it	is	born	by	curiosity	and	exploration	.
But	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	safe	exploration	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	to	be	 O 	 K 	 	--	he	's	an	 an 	 atomic 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	little	boy	and	that	's	his	mom	.	Other	 situ 	 ations 	 	would	n't	be	 quit 	 e 	 	so	good	.
But	curiosity	,	exploration	,	are	part	of	the	play	scene	.
If	you	want	to	belong	,	you	need	social	play	.
And	social	play	is	part	of	what	we	're	about	here	 to 	 day 	 	,	and	is	a	 by 	 product 	 	of	the	play	scene	.
Rough	and	tumble	play	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	 lion 	 es 	 s 	 es 	 	,	 s 	 een 	 	from	a	distance	,	 look 	 ed 	 	like	they	 we 	 re 	 	 fight 	 ing 	 	.
But	if	you	look	 close 	 ly 	 	,	they	're	kind	of	like	the	polar	bear	and	 husk 	 y 	 	:	no	 claw 	 s 	 	,	flat	fur	,	soft	 eye 	 s 	 	,	open	mouth	with	no	 fang 	 s 	 	,	 ballet 	 ic 	 	 move 	 ments 	 	,	 curv 	 i 	 linear 	 	 move 	 ments 	 	--	all	specific	to	play	.
And	 rough 	 - 	 and 	 - 	 tumble 	 	play	is	a	great	 learn 	 ing 	 	medium	for	all	of	us	.
 Pre 	 school 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	should	be	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	 d 	 ive 	 	,	hit	,	 whistl 	 e 	 	,	 s 	 cream 	 	,	be	chaotic	,	and	develop	through	that	a	lot	of	 emotion 	 al 	 	 regulat 	 ion 	 	and	a	lot	of	the	other	social	 by 	 product 	 s 	 	--	cognitive	,	 emotion 	 al 	 	and	physical	--	that	come	 a 	 s 	 	a	part	of	rough	and	tumble	play	.
 Spect 	 ator 	 	play	,	ritual	play	--	we	're	 involve 	 d 	 	in	some	of	that	.
 T 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	are	from	 Bo 	 s 	 ton 	 	know	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	moment	--	rare	--	where	the	Red	 So 	 x 	 	won	the	World	 S 	 eries 	 	.
But	take	a	look	at	the	face	and	the	body	language	of	 every 	 body 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 fuzz 	 y 	 	picture	,	and	you	can	get	a	sense	that	they	're	all	at	play	.
 Imagin 	 ative 	 	play	.
I	love	 th 	 is 	 	picture	 be 	 cause 	 	my	daughter	,	who	's	now	 al 	 most 	 	40	,	is	in	 th 	 is 	 	picture	,	but	it	 re 	 mind 	 s 	 	me	of	her	 story 	 tell 	 ing 	 	and	her	 imagin 	 ation 	 	,	her	ability	to	spin	 yarn 	 s 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	age	--	 pre 	 school 	 	.
A	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	part	of	 be 	 ing 	 	a	player	is	 imagin 	 ative 	 	 s 	 olo 	 	play	.
And	I	love	 th 	 is 	 	one	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	what	we	're	about	.
We	all	have	an	internal	narrative	that	's	our	own	inner	story	.
The	unit	of	 intellig 	 ibility 	 	of	most	of	our	 brain 	 s 	 	is	the	story	.
I	'm	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	a	story	 to 	 day 	 	about	play	.
Well	,	 th 	 is 	 	 bush 	 man 	 	,	I	think	,	is	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	fish	that	got	away	that	was	that	long	,	but	it	's	a	fundamental	part	of	the	play	scene	.
So	what	 do 	 es 	 	play	do	for	the	brain	?
Well	,	a	lot	.
We	do	n't	know	a	whole	lot	about	what	it	 do 	 es 	 	for	the	human	brain	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 fund 	 ing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	not	 be 	 en 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	heavy	for	research	on	play	.
I	 walk 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 Car 	 neg 	 ie 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	for	a	grant	.
 The 	 y 	 	'd	 give 	 n 	 	me	a	large	grant	when	I	was	an	 academic 	 ian 	 	for	the	 stud 	 y 	 	of	 felon 	 y 	 	 drunk 	 en 	 	 driver 	 s 	 	,	and	I	thought	I	had	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	track	record	,	and	by	the	time	I	had	 s 	 pent 	 	half	an	hour	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	play	,	it	was	obvious	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	not	--	did	not	feel	that	play	was	serious	.
I	think	that	--	that	's	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	back	--	I	think	that	wave	is	past	,	and	the	play	wave	is	 crest 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	is	some	good	science	.
 No 	 thing 	 	 light 	 s 	 	up	the	brain	like	play	.
 Three 	 - 	 dimensional 	 	play	 fire 	 s 	 	up	the	 ce 	 rebel 	 lum 	 	,	 put 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	 impulse 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	frontal	lobe	--	the	 ex 	 ecutive 	 	 port 	 ion 	 	--	 help 	 s 	 	contextual	 memor 	 y 	 	be	 develop 	 ed 	 	,	and	--	and	,	and	,	and	.
So	it	's	--	for	me	,	 it 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	an	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 nourish 	 ing 	 	 scholar 	 ly 	 	adventure	to	look	at	the	 neuro 	 science 	 	that	's	 associate 	 d 	 	with	play	,	and	to	 br 	 ing 	 	together	people	who	in	 the 	 ir 	 	individual	 discipline 	 s 	 	had	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	thought	of	it	that	way	.
And	that	's	part	of	what	the	National	Institute	for	Play	is	all	about	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	ways	you	can	 stud 	 y 	 	play	--	is	to	get	a	256-lead	 electro 	 encephalo 	 gram 	 	.
I	'm	sorry	I	do	n't	have	a	 play 	 ful 	 - 	 looking 	 	subject	,	but	it	 allow 	 s 	 	 mobil 	 ity 	 	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 limit 	 ed 	 	the	actual	 stud 	 y 	 	of	play	.
And	we	've	got	a	 mother 	 - 	 infant 	 	play	scenario	that	we	're	 hop 	 ing 	 	to	complete	 under 	 way 	 	at	the	moment	.
The	reason	I	put	 th 	 is 	 	here	is	 al 	 so 	 	to	queue	up	my	 thought 	 s 	 	about	 object 	 ifying 	 	what	play	 do 	 es 	 	.
The	animal	world	 ha 	 s 	 	 object 	 ified 	 	it	.
In	the	animal	world	,	if	you	take	 rat 	 s 	 	,	who	are	 hard 	 wired 	 	to	play	at	a	certain	period	of	 the 	 ir 	 	juvenile	 year 	 s 	 	and	you	suppress	play	--	they	squeak	,	they	 wrestl 	 e 	 	,	they	pin	each	other	,	that	's	part	of	 the 	 ir 	 	play	.
If	you	stop	that	behavior	on	one	group	that	you	're	 experiment 	 ing 	 	with	,	and	you	allow	it	in	 an 	 other 	 	group	that	you	're	 experiment 	 ing 	 	with	,	and	then	you	present	 t 	 hose 	 	 rat 	 s 	 	with	a	cat	 odor 	 - 	 saturate 	 d 	 	collar	,	they	're	 hard 	 wired 	 	to	flee	and	hide	.
 Pre 	 tty 	 	smart	--	they	do	n't	want	to	get	 kill 	 ed 	 	by	a	cat	.
So	what	 happen 	 s 	 	?
 The 	 y 	 	both	hide	out	.
The	 non 	 - 	 player 	 s 	 	never	come	out	--	they	die	.
The	 player 	 s 	 	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	explore	the	environment	,	and	begin	 aga 	 in 	 	to	test	 thing 	 s 	 	out	.
That	 say 	 s 	 	to	me	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	in	 rat 	 s 	 	--	and	I	think	they	have	the	same	 neuro 	 transmit 	 ter 	 s 	 	that	we	do	and	a	similar	 cort 	 ical 	 	 architect 	 ure 	 	--	that	play	may	be	 pre 	 tty 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	for	our	 surviv 	 al 	 	.
And	,	and	,	and	--	there	are	a	lot	more	animal	 stud 	 ies 	 	that	I	could	talk	about	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 con 	 sequence 	 	of	play	 depriv 	 ation 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	took	a	long	time	--	I	had	to	get	 Hom 	 er 	 	down	and	put	him	through	the	 f 	 MRI 	 	and	the	 SP 	 ECT 	 	and	 multi 	 ple 	 	 E 	 EG 	 s 	 	,	but	 a 	 s 	 	a	couch	potato	,	his	brain	 ha 	 s 	 	shrunk	.
And	we	do	know	that	in	domestic	 animal 	 s 	 	and	 other 	 s 	 	,	when	they	're	play	 depriv 	 ed 	 	,	they	do	n't	--	and	 rat 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	--	they	do	n't	develop	a	brain	that	is	normal	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	the	program	 say 	 s 	 	that	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	of	play	is	not	work	,	it	's	 depress 	 ion 	 	.
And	I	think	if	you	think	about	life	 with 	 out 	 	play	--	no	humor	,	no	 flirt 	 ation 	 	,	no	 movie 	 s 	 	,	no	 game 	 s 	 	,	no	 fanta 	 s 	 y 	 	and	,	and	,	and	.
 T 	 ry 	 	and	imagine	a	culture	or	a	life	,	adult	or	 other 	 wise 	 	 with 	 out 	 	play	.
And	the	thing	that	's	so	 un 	 ique 	 	about	our	species	is	that	we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	designed	to	play	through	our	whole	 life 	 time 	 	.
And	we	all	have	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	play	signal	.
 No 	 body 	 	 mis 	 s 	 es 	 	that	dog	I	took	a	picture	of	on	a	 Car 	 mel 	 	beach	a	couple	of	 week 	 s 	 	ago	.
What	's	going	to	follow	from	that	behavior	is	play	.
And	you	can	trust	it	.
The	 bas 	 is 	 	of	human	trust	is	 establish 	 ed 	 	through	play	 signal 	 s 	 	.
And	we	begin	to	lose	 t 	 hose 	 	 signal 	 s 	 	,	 cultural 	 ly 	 	and	 other 	 wise 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 adult 	 s 	 	.
That	's	a	shame	.
I	think	we	've	got	a	lot	of	 learn 	 ing 	 	to	do	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	Jane	 Good 	 all 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	here	a	play	face	 a 	 long 	 	with	one	of	her	 favor 	 ite 	 	 chimp 	 s 	 	.
So	part	of	the	 signal 	 ing 	 	system	of	play	 ha 	 s 	 	to	do	with	vocal	,	 fa 	 cial 	 	,	body	,	 gest 	 ural 	 	.
You	know	,	you	can	tell	--	and	I	think	when	we	're	 get 	 ting 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 collect 	 ive 	 	play	,	 it 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	for	 group 	 s 	 	to	gain	a	sense	of	 safe 	 ty 	 	through	 the 	 ir 	 	own	sharing	of	play	 signal 	 s 	 	.
You	may	not	know	 th 	 is 	 	word	,	but	it	should	be	your	 bio 	 logical 	 	first	name	and	last	name	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	 neoten 	 y 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	the	 re 	 tent 	 ion 	 	of	 im 	 mature 	 	 qual 	 ities 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 adult 	 hood 	 	.
And	we	are	,	by	physical	 anthropo 	 logists 	 	,	by	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 stud 	 ies 	 	,	the	most	 neoten 	 ous 	 	,	the	most	 youth 	 ful 	 	,	the	most	 flex 	 ible 	 	,	the	most	plastic	of	all	 creature 	 s 	 	.
And	 there 	 fore 	 	,	the	most	 play 	 ful 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	 give 	 s 	 	us	a	leg	up	on	 adapt 	 ability 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	there	is	a	way	of	looking	at	play	that	I	 al 	 so 	 	want	to	 emphas 	 ize 	 	here	,	which	is	the	play	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
Your	own	personal	play	 histo 	 ry 	 	is	 un 	 ique 	 	,	and	often	is	not	 some 	 thing 	 	we	think	about	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	book	written	by	a	 consum 	 mate 	 	player	by	the	name	of	 K 	 e 	 vin 	 	 Car 	 roll 	 	.
 K 	 e 	 vin 	 	 Car 	 roll 	 	came	from	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 depriv 	 ed 	 	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	:	 alcohol 	 ic 	 	mother	,	absent	father	,	 inner 	 - 	 city 	 	 Phil 	 adelphia 	 	,	black	,	had	to	take	care	of	a	 young 	 er 	 	brother	.
Found	that	when	he	 look 	 ed 	 	at	a	 play 	 ground 	 	out	of	a	window	 in 	 to 	 	which	he	had	 be 	 en 	 	 con 	 fin 	 ed 	 	,	he	felt	 some 	 thing 	 	different	.
And	so	he	 follow 	 ed 	 	up	on	it	.
And	his	life	--	the	 transform 	 ation 	 	of	his	life	from	 depriv 	 ation 	 	and	what	one	would	expect	--	 potential 	 ly 	 	 pri 	 son 	 	or	death	--	he	 be 	 come 	 	a	linguist	,	a	 train 	 er 	 	for	the	76ers	and	now	is	a	 motiv 	 ation 	 al 	 	speaker	.
And	he	 give 	 s 	 	play	 a 	 s 	 	a	 transform 	 ative 	 	force	over	his	entire	life	.
 N 	 ow 	 	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	play	 histo 	 ry 	 	that	I	think	is	a	work	in	progress	.
 T 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	remember	Al	 Go 	 re 	 	,	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	first	term	and	then	 dur 	 ing 	 	his	 success 	 ful 	 	but	 un 	 elect 	 ed 	 	run	for	the	 pre 	 side 	 ncy 	 	,	may	remember	him	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	kind	of	 wood 	 en 	 	and	not	 entire 	 ly 	 	his	own	person	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	in	public	.
And	looking	at	his	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	which	is	common	in	the	press	,	it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	me	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	--	looking	at	it	from	a	shrink	's	point	of	view	--	that	a	lot	of	his	life	was	 programm 	 ed 	 	.
 Summ 	 ers 	 	 we 	 re 	 	hard	,	hard	work	,	in	the	heat	of	 Ten 	 ness 	 ee 	 	 summer 	 s 	 	.
He	had	the	 expect 	 ations 	 	of	his	 senator 	 ial 	 	father	and	 Wash 	 ington 	 	,	 D. 	 C 	 	.
And	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	I	think	he	 certain 	 ly 	 	had	the	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	for	play	--	 be 	 cause 	 	I	do	know	 some 	 thing 	 	about	that	--	he	was	n't	 a 	 s 	 	 empower 	 ed 	 	,	I	think	,	 a 	 s 	 	he	now	is	by	 pay 	 ing 	 	attention	to	what	is	his	own	 pass 	 ion 	 	and	his	own	inner	drive	,	which	I	think	 ha 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 bas 	 is 	 	in	all	of	us	in	our	play	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
So	what	I	would	 encourag 	 e 	 	on	an	individual	level	to	do	,	is	to	explore	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	go	to	the	most	clear	,	 joy 	 ful 	 	,	 play 	 ful 	 	image	that	you	have	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	with	a	 to 	 y 	 	,	on	a	 birth 	 day 	 	or	on	a	 vac 	 ation 	 	.
And	begin	to	build	to	build	from	the	emotion	of	that	 in 	 to 	 	how	that	 connect 	 s 	 	with	your	life	now	.
And	you	'll	find	,	you	may	change	 job 	 s 	 	--	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	a	number	people	when	I	've	had	them	do	 th 	 is 	 	--	in	order	to	be	more	 empower 	 ed 	 	through	 the 	 ir 	 	play	.
Or	you	'll	be	able	to	enrich	your	life	by	 priori 	 tizing 	 	it	and	 pay 	 ing 	 	attention	to	it	.
 Mo 	 st 	 	of	us	work	with	 group 	 s 	 	,	and	I	put	 th 	 is 	 	up	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 d 	 . 	 school 	 	,	the	design	school	at	 Stan 	 ford 	 	,	 thank 	 s 	 	to	 D 	 avid 	 	 Kell 	 ey 	 	and	a	lot	of	 other 	 s 	 	who	have	 be 	 en 	 	 vision 	 ary 	 	about	 it 	 s 	 	 establish 	 ment 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 allow 	 ed 	 	a	group	of	us	to	get	together	and	create	a	course	 call 	 ed 	 	``	From	Play	to	 Innov 	 ation 	 	.	''
And	you	'll	see	 th 	 is 	 	course	is	to	investigate	the	human	state	of	play	,	which	is	kind	of	like	the	polar	 bear 	 - 	 husk 	 y 	 	state	and	 it 	 s 	 	 import 	 ance 	 	to	creative	 think 	 ing 	 	:	``	to	explore	play	behavior	,	 it 	 s 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	and	 it 	 s 	 	 bio 	 logical 	 	 bas 	 is 	 	;	to	 app 	 ly 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 principle 	 s 	 	,	through	design	 think 	 ing 	 	,	to	promote	 innov 	 ation 	 	in	the	corporate	world	;	and	the	 student 	 s 	 	will	work	with	 real 	 - 	 world 	 	 partner 	 s 	 	on	design	 project 	 s 	 	with	 wide 	 spread 	 	application	.	''
 Th 	 is 	 	is	our	maiden	voyage	in	 th 	 is 	 	.
We	're	about	two	and	a	half	,	three	 month 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	it	,	and	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 f 	 un 	 	.
There	is	our	star	pupil	,	 th 	 is 	 	 lab 	 r 	 ador 	 	,	who	taught	a	lot	of	us	what	a	state	of	play	is	,	and	an	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	aged	and	 decr 	 epit 	 	professor	in	charge	there	.
And	 Bren 	 dan 	 	 Boy 	 le 	 	,	Rich	 Cran 	 d 	 all 	 	--	and	on	the	far	right	is	,	I	think	,	a	person	who	will	be	in	 ca 	 hoots 	 	with	George	 S 	 moot 	 	for	a	 No 	 bel 	 	Prize	--	 Stu 	 art 	 	 Thom 	 p 	 son 	 	,	in	 neuro 	 science 	 	.
So	we	've	had	 Bren 	 dan 	 	,	who	's	from	IDEO	,	and	the	rest	of	us	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	 a 	 side 	 	and	 watch 	 ing 	 	these	 student 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	put	play	 principle 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	practice	in	the	 class 	 room 	 	.
And	one	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 project 	 s 	 	was	to	see	what	 make 	 s 	 	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	 bor 	 ing 	 	,	and	to	try	and	do	 some 	 thing 	 	about	it	.
So	what	will	follow	is	a	 student 	 - 	 made 	 	film	about	just	that	.
 Nar 	 rator 	 	:	 F 	 low 	 	is	the	mental	state	of	 appar 	 ition 	 	in	which	the	person	is	fully	 immers 	 ed 	 	in	what	he	or	she	is	 do 	 ing 	 	.
 Character 	 ized 	 	by	a	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	 energ 	 ized 	 	focus	,	full	 involve 	 ment 	 	and	success	in	the	process	of	the	activity	.
An	 import 	 ant 	 	key	 in 	 sight 	 	that	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	about	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	is	that	people	pack	them	in	one	after	 an 	 other 	 	,	 disrupt 	 ive 	 	to	the	day	.
 Atten 	 de 	 es 	 	at	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	do	n't	know	when	they	'll	get	back	to	the	task	that	they	left	at	 the 	 ir 	 	desk	.
But	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	to	be	that	way	.
Some	 s 	 age 	 	and	 repeat 	 ed 	 ly 	 	 fur 	 ry 	 	 monk 	 s 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	place	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 d 	 . 	 school 	 	designed	a	 meet 	 ing 	 	that	you	can	 liter 	 ally 	 	step	out	of	when	it	's	over	.
Take	the	 meet 	 ing 	 	off	,	and	have	peace	of	mind	that	you	can	come	back	to	me	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	when	you	need	it	 aga 	 in 	 	,	the	 meet 	 ing 	 	is	 liter 	 ally 	 	 hang 	 ing 	 	in	your	 close 	 t 	 	.
The	 Wear 	 able 	 	 Meet 	 ing 	 	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	when	you	put	it	on	,	you	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	get	 every 	 thing 	 	you	need	to	have	a	 f 	 un 	 	and	productive	and	 use 	 ful 	 	 meet 	 ing 	 	.
But	when	you	take	it	off	--	that	's	when	the	real	action	 happen 	 s 	 	.
 Stu 	 art 	 	Brown	:	So	I	would	 encourag 	 e 	 	you	all	to	engage	not	in	the	 work 	 - 	 play 	 	 different 	 ial 	 	--	where	you	set	 a 	 side 	 	time	to	play	--	but	where	your	life	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 in 	 fused 	 	minute	by	minute	,	hour	by	hour	,	with	body	,	object	,	social	,	 fanta 	 s 	 y 	 	,	 transform 	 ation 	 al 	 	 kind 	 s 	 	of	play	.
And	I	think	you	'll	have	a	better	and	more	 empower 	 ed 	 	life	.
Thank	You	.
John	 H 	 ocken 	 berry 	 	:	So	it	 sound 	 s 	 	to	me	like	what	you	're	 say 	 ing 	 	is	that	there	may	be	some	 tempt 	 ation 	 	on	the	part	of	people	to	look	at	your	work	and	go	--	I	think	I	've	heard	 th 	 is 	 	,	in	my	kind	of	pop	 psycho 	 logical 	 	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	play	,	that	 some 	 how 	 	,	the	way	 animal 	 s 	 	and	 human 	 s 	 	deal	with	play	,	is	that	it	's	some	sort	of	 rehears 	 al 	 	for	adult	activity	.
Your	work	 seem 	 s 	 	to	suggest	that	that	is	 power 	 fully 	 	wrong	.
 S 	 B 	 	:	Yeah	,	I	do	n't	think	that	's	accurate	,	and	I	think	 prob 	 ably 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	have	taught	us	that	.
If	you	stop	a	cat	from	 play 	 ing 	 	--	which	you	can	do	,	and	we	've	all	 s 	 een 	 	how	 cat 	 s 	 	bat	around	stuff	--	they	're	just	 a 	 s 	 	good	 predator 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	would	be	if	they	had	n't	 play 	 ed 	 	.
And	if	you	imagine	a	kid	 pretend 	 ing 	 	to	be	 K 	 ing 	 	 K 	 ong 	 	,	or	a	race	car	driver	,	or	a	 fire 	 man 	 	,	they	do	n't	all	 be 	 come 	 	race	car	 driver 	 s 	 	or	 fire 	 men 	 	,	you	know	.
So	there	's	a	 dis 	 connect 	 	between	 pre 	 par 	 ation 	 	for	the	future	--	which	is	what	most	people	are	 comfort 	 able 	 	in	 think 	 ing 	 	about	play	 a 	 s 	 	--	and	 think 	 ing 	 	of	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	 separat 	 e 	 	 bio 	 logical 	 	 ent 	 ity 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	my	chasing	 animal 	 s 	 	for	four	,	five	 year 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 change 	 d 	 	my	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	from	a	 clinic 	 ian 	 	to	what	I	am	now	,	which	is	that	play	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 bio 	 logical 	 	place	,	just	like	sleep	and	 dream 	 s 	 	do	.
And	if	you	look	at	sleep	and	 dream 	 s 	 	 bio 	 logically 	 	,	 animal 	 s 	 	sleep	and	dream	,	and	they	 rehears 	 e 	 	and	they	do	some	other	 thing 	 s 	 	that	help	 memor 	 y 	 	and	that	are	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	part	of	sleep	and	 dream 	 s 	 	.
The	next	step	of	evolution	in	 mammal 	 s 	 	and	 creature 	 s 	 	with	 divine 	 ly 	 	 super 	 flu 	 ous 	 	 neuro 	 ns 	 	will	be	to	play	.
And	the	fact	that	the	polar	bear	and	 husk 	 y 	 	or	magpie	and	a	bear	or	you	and	I	and	our	 dog 	 s 	 	can	 cross 	 over 	 	and	have	that	experience	 set 	 s 	 	play	 a 	 side 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 separat 	 e 	 	.
And	 it 	 s 	 	 huge 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	in	 learn 	 ing 	 	and	 craft 	 ing 	 	the	brain	.
So	it	's	not	just	 some 	 thing 	 	you	do	in	your	spare	time	.
 J 	 H 	 	:	How	do	you	keep	--	and	I	know	you	're	part	of	the	scientific	research	community	,	and	you	have	to	 just 	 ify 	 	your	 exist 	 ence 	 	with	 grant 	 s 	 	and	 proposal 	 s 	 	like	 every 	 one 	 	else	--	how	do	you	prevent	--	and	some	of	the	data	that	you	've	 produce 	 d 	 	,	the	good	science	that	you	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	you	've	 produce 	 d 	 	,	is	hot	to	handle	.
How	do	you	prevent	either	the	media	's	 interpret 	 ation 	 	of	your	work	or	the	scientific	community	's	 interpret 	 ation 	 	of	the	 implic 	 ations 	 	of	your	work	,	kind	of	like	the	 Mo 	 z 	 art 	 	metaphor	,	where	,	``	Oh	,	 MRI 	 s 	 	show	that	play	 enhance 	 s 	 	your	 intellig 	 ence 	 	.
Well	,	let	's	round	these	 kid 	 s 	 	up	,	put	them	in	 pen 	 s 	 	and	make	them	play	for	 month 	 s 	 	at	a	time	;	they	'll	all	be	 gen 	 ius 	 es 	 	and	go	to	Harvard	.	''
How	do	you	prevent	people	from	taking	that	sort	of	action	on	the	data	that	you	're	 develop 	 ing 	 	?
 S 	 B 	 	:	Well	,	I	think	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	I	know	to	do	it	is	to	have	 accumul 	 ated 	 	the	 advise 	 rs 	 	that	I	have	who	go	from	 practitioner 	 s 	 	--	who	can	establish	through	 improvisation 	 al 	 	play	or	 clown 	 ing 	 	or	 what 	 ever 	 	--	a	state	of	play	.
So	people	know	that	it	's	there	.
And	then	you	get	an	 f 	 MRI 	 	 special 	 ist 	 	,	and	you	get	Frank	 Wil 	 son 	 	,	and	you	get	other	 kind 	 s 	 	of	hard	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 neuro 	 endo 	 cri 	 no 	 logists 	 	.
And	you	get	them	 in 	 to 	 	a	group	together	focused	on	play	,	and	it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	hard	not	to	take	it	 serious 	 ly 	 	.
 Un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	that	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 be 	 en 	 	 d 	 one 	 	 sufficient 	 ly 	 	for	the	National	Science	 Found 	 ation 	 	,	National	Institute	of	 Men 	 tal 	 	Health	or	 any 	 body 	 	else	to	 re 	 ally 	 	look	at	it	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	 serious 	 ly 	 	.
I	mean	you	do	n't	hear	about	 any 	 thing 	 	that	's	like	cancer	or	heart	disease	 associate 	 d 	 	with	play	.
And	yet	I	see	it	 a 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	just	 a 	 s 	 	 bas 	 ic 	 	for	 surviv 	 al 	 	--	long	term	--	 a 	 s 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	some	of	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	about	public	health	.
 J 	 H 	 	:	 Stu 	 art 	 	Brown	,	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
How	 do 	 es 	 	the	news	shape	the	way	we	see	the	world	?
 He 	 re 	 	's	the	world	based	on	the	way	it	 look 	 s 	 	--	based	on	 land 	 mass 	 	.
And	here	's	how	news	 shape 	 s 	 	what	 American 	 s 	 	see	.
 Th 	 is 	 	map	--	--	 th 	 is 	 	map	 show 	 s 	 	the	number	of	 second 	 s 	 	that	American	network	and	cable	news	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	 dedicate 	 d 	 	to	news	 st 	 ories 	 	,	by	country	,	in	 Fe 	 br 	 uary 	 	of	2007	--	just	one	year	ago	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	month	when	North	Korea	 agree 	 d 	 	to	dismantle	 it 	 s 	 	nuclear	 facil 	 ities 	 	.
There	was	massive	 flood 	 ing 	 	in	Indonesia	.
And	in	Paris	,	the	 IP 	 CC 	 	released	 it 	 s 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	 confirm 	 ing 	 	man	's	impact	on	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	.
The	U.S.	 account 	 ed 	 	for	79	percent	of	total	news	 cover 	 age 	 	.
And	when	we	take	out	the	U.S.	and	look	at	the	 remain 	 ing 	 	21	percent	,	we	see	a	lot	of	Iraq	--	that	's	that	big	green	thing	there	--	and	little	else	.
The	 combine 	 d 	 	 cover 	 age 	 	of	Russia	,	China	and	India	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 reach 	 ed 	 	just	one	percent	.
When	we	 analyz 	 ed 	 	all	the	news	 st 	 ories 	 	and	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	just	one	story	,	here	's	how	the	world	 look 	 ed 	 	.
What	was	that	story	?	The	death	of	 Ann 	 a 	 	 Nico 	 le 	 	Smith	.
 Th 	 is 	 	story	 eclipse 	 d 	 	every	country	 ex 	 cept 	 	Iraq	,	and	 receiv 	 ed 	 	10	 time 	 s 	 	the	 cover 	 age 	 	of	the	 IP 	 CC 	 	report	.
And	the	cycle	 continu 	 es 	 	;	 a 	 s 	 	we	all	know	,	 Brit 	 ney 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 loom 	 ed 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	large	 late 	 ly 	 	.
So	,	why	do	n't	we	hear	more	about	the	world	?
One	reason	is	that	news	 network 	 s 	 	have	 reduc 	 ed 	 	the	number	of	 the 	 ir 	 	foreign	 bureau 	 s 	 	by	half	.
 A 	 side 	 	from	 one 	 - 	 person 	 	 AB 	 C 	 	 mini 	 - 	 bureau 	 s 	 	in	Nairobi	,	New	 Del 	 hi 	 	and	Mumbai	,	there	are	no	network	news	 bureau 	 s 	 	in	all	of	 Afri 	 ca 	 	,	India	or	South	America	--	 place 	 s 	 	that	are	home	to	more	than	two	billion	people	.
The	 re 	 ality 	 	is	that	 cover 	 ing 	 	 Brit 	 ney 	 	is	 cheap 	 er 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	lack	of	global	 cover 	 age 	 	is	all	the	more	 disturb 	 ing 	 	when	we	see	where	people	go	for	news	.
 Lo 	 c 	 al 	 	TV	news	 loom 	 s 	 	large	,	and	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	 dedicate 	 s 	 	12	percent	of	 it 	 s 	 	 cover 	 age 	 	to	 inter 	 national 	 	news	.
And	what	about	the	web	?
The	most	popular	news	 s 	 ites 	 	do	n't	do	much	better	.
Last	year	,	 Pe 	 w 	 	and	the	Colombia	 J 	 - 	 School 	 	 analyz 	 ed 	 	the	14,000	 st 	 ories 	 	that	 appear 	 ed 	 	on	Google	 New 	 s 	 	'	front	page	.
And	they	,	in	fact	,	 cover 	 ed 	 	the	same	24	news	 event 	 s 	 	.
 Similar 	 ly 	 	,	a	 stud 	 y 	 	in	 e 	 - 	 content 	 	 show 	 ed 	 	that	much	of	global	news	from	U.S.	news	 creator 	 s 	 	is	 recycl 	 ed 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	from	the	AP	wire	 service 	 s 	 	and	 Re 	 ut 	 ers 	 	,	and	do	n't	put	 thing 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	 con 	 text 	 	that	people	can	understand	 the 	 ir 	 	 connect 	 ion 	 	to	it	.
So	,	if	you	put	it	all	together	,	 th 	 is 	 	could	help	explain	why	 to 	 day 	 	's	college	 graduate 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	less	educated	 American 	 s 	 	,	know	less	about	the	world	than	 the 	 ir 	 	 counter 	 part 	 s 	 	did	20	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
And	if	you	think	it	's	 simpl 	 y 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	are	not	 interest 	 ed 	 	,	you	would	be	wrong	.
In	 re 	 cent 	 	 year 	 s 	 	,	 American 	 s 	 	who	say	they	 close 	 ly 	 	follow	global	news	most	of	the	time	grew	to	over	50	percent	.
The	real	question	:	is	 th 	 is 	 	 distort 	 ed 	 	 world 	 view 	 	what	we	want	for	 American 	 s 	 	in	our	 increasing 	 ly 	 	 interconnect 	 ed 	 	world	?
I	know	we	can	do	better	.
And	can	we	afford	not	to	?	Thank	you	.
Ben	 Ro 	 che 	 	:	So	I	'm	Ben	,	by	the	way	.
 Hom 	 aro 	 	 Can 	 tu 	 	:	And	I	'm	 Hom 	 aro 	 	.
 B 	 R 	 	:	And	we	're	 chef 	 s 	 	.	So	when	 Mo 	 to 	 	 open 	 ed 	 	in	2004	,	people	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	know	what	to	expect	.	A	lot	of	people	thought	that	it	was	a	 Japan 	 ese 	 	restaurant	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	it	was	the	name	,	 may 	 be 	 	it	was	the	logo	,	which	was	like	a	 Japan 	 ese 	 	character	,	but	 any 	 way 	 	,	we	had	all	these	 request 	 s 	 	for	 Japan 	 ese 	 	food	,	which	is	 re 	 ally 	 	not	what	we	did	.	And	after	about	the	ten	 thousand 	 th 	 	request	for	a	 ma 	 ki 	 	roll	,	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	give	the	people	what	they	 want 	 ed 	 	.	So	 th 	 is 	 	picture	is	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 print 	 ed 	 	food	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	first	 fo 	 ray 	 	 in 	 to 	 	what	we	like	to	call	flavor	 transform 	 ation 	 	.	So	 th 	 is 	 	is	all	the	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	,	all	the	flavor	of	,	you	know	,	a	standard	 ma 	 ki 	 	roll	,	 print 	 ed 	 	onto	a	little	piece	of	paper	.
HC	:	So	our	 din 	 ers 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	to	get	 bor 	 ed 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	idea	,	and	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	give	them	the	same	course	twice	,	so	here	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	took	an	element	from	the	 ma 	 ki 	 	roll	and	and	took	a	picture	of	a	dish	and	then	 bas 	 ically 	 	 serv 	 ed 	 	that	picture	with	the	dish	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	dish	in	 part 	 icular 	 	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	 champ 	 agne 	 	with	 sea 	 food 	 	.
The	 champ 	 agne 	 	 grape 	 s 	 	that	you	see	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 carbon 	 ated 	 	 grape 	 s 	 	.	A	little	bit	of	 sea 	 food 	 	and	some	crème	fraiche	and	the	picture	 actual 	 ly 	 	 taste 	 s 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	like	the	dish	.
 B 	 R 	 	:	But	it	's	not	all	just	 ed 	 ible 	 	 picture 	 s 	 	.
We	 decide 	 d 	 	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	a	little	bit	different	and	transform	 flavor 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	familiar	--	so	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	we	have	carrot	cake	.
So	we	take	a	carrot	cake	,	put	it	in	a	 blend 	 er 	 	,	and	we	have	kind	of	like	a	carrot	cake	juice	,	and	then	that	went	 in 	 to 	 	a	balloon	 froze 	 n 	 	in	liquid	nitrogen	to	create	 th 	 is 	 	hollow	shell	of	carrot	cake	ice	cream	,	I	guess	,	and	it	 come 	 s 	 	off	looking	like	,	you	know	,	Jupiter	's	 float 	 ing 	 	around	your	plate	.
So	 yea 	 h 	 	,	we	're	 transform 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	you	have	 absolute 	 ly 	 	no	 re 	 ference 	 	for	.
HC	:	And	here	's	 some 	 thing 	 	we	have	no	 re 	 ference 	 	to	eat	.	 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	cigar	,	and	 bas 	 ically 	 	it	's	a	 Cub 	 an 	 	cigar	made	out	of	a	 Cub 	 an 	 	pork	sandwich	,	so	we	take	these	 spice 	 s 	 	that	go	 in 	 to 	 	the	pork	shoulder	,	we	fashion	that	 in 	 to 	 	ash	.	We	take	the	sandwich	and	wrap	it	up	in	a	 collar 	 d 	 	green	,	put	an	 ed 	 ible 	 	label	that	 bear 	 s 	 	no	 similar 	 ity 	 	to	a	Cohiba	cigar	label	,	and	we	put	it	in	a	dollar	 ninety 	 - 	 nine 	 	ashtray	and	charge	you	about	twenty	 buck 	 s 	 	for	it	.
HC	:	 Del 	 ic 	 ious 	 	.
 B 	 R 	 	:	That	's	not	it	,	 th 	 ough 	 	.
 In 	 stead 	 	of	making	 food 	 s 	 	that	look	like	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	would	n't	eat	,	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	make	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	look	like	 dish 	 es 	 	that	you	know	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	plate	of	nachos	.
The	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	our	nachos	and	the	other	guy	's	nachos	,	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	dessert	.
So	the	 chip 	 s 	 	are	 can 	 di 	 ed 	 	,	the	ground	beef	is	made	from	chocolate	,	and	the	cheese	is	made	from	a	 shred 	 d 	 ed 	 	 man 	 go 	 	 s 	 or 	 bet 	 	that	 get 	 s 	 	 shred 	 d 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	liquid	nitrogen	to	look	like	cheese	.
And	after	 do 	 ing 	 	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	 de 	 material 	 ization 	 	and	 reconfigur 	 ing 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	of	these	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	,	we	 real 	 ized 	 	that	it	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	cool	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	 serv 	 ed 	 	it	,	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	the	dish	 actual 	 ly 	 	 behav 	 es 	 	like	the	real	thing	,	where	the	cheese	 begin 	 s 	 	to	melt	.
So	when	you	're	looking	at	 th 	 is 	 	thing	in	the	 din 	 ing 	 	room	,	you	have	 th 	 is 	 	 sens 	 ation 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	plate	of	nachos	,	and	it	's	not	 re 	 ally 	 	 un 	 til 	 	you	begin	tasting	it	that	you	 real 	 ize 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	dessert	,	and	it	's	just	kind	of	like	a	 mind 	 - 	 rip 	 per 	 	.
HC	:	So	we	had	 be 	 en 	 	creating	all	of	these	 dish 	 es 	 	out	of	a	kitchen	that	was	more	like	a	mechanic	's	shop	than	a	kitchen	,	and	the	next	logical	step	for	us	was	to	install	a	 state 	 - 	 of 	 - 	 the 	 - 	 art 	 	 labor 	 atory 	 	,	and	that	's	what	we	have	here	.
So	we	put	 th 	 is 	 	in	the	 base 	 ment 	 	,	and	we	got	 re 	 ally 	 	serious	about	food	,	like	serious	 experiment 	 ation 	 	.
 B 	 R 	 	:	One	of	the	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	 thing 	 s 	 	about	the	lab	,	 be 	 side 	 s 	 	that	we	have	a	new	science	lab	in	the	kitchen	,	is	that	,	you	know	,	with	 th 	 is 	 	new	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	new	approach	,	all	these	different	 door 	 s 	 	to	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	that	we	never	 k 	 new 	 	 we 	 re 	 	there	 beg 	 an 	 	to	open	,	and	so	the	 experiment 	 s 	 	and	the	food	and	the	 dish 	 es 	 	that	we	 create 	 d 	 	,	they	just	 ke 	 pt 	 	going	further	and	further	out	there	.
HC	:	Let	's	talk	about	flavor	 transform 	 ation 	 	,	and	let	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	make	some	cool	stuff	.
You	see	a	cow	with	 it 	 s 	 	tongue	 hang 	 ing 	 	out	.
What	I	see	is	a	cow	about	to	eat	 some 	 thing 	 	 delic 	 ious 	 	.	What	is	that	cow	eating	?
And	why	is	it	 delic 	 ious 	 	?
So	the	cow	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	eats	three	 bas 	 ic 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	feed	:	corn	,	 bee 	 ts 	 	,	and	 bar 	 ley 	 	,	and	so	what	I	do	is	I	 actual 	 ly 	 	 challeng 	 e 	 	my	staff	with	these	crazy	,	wild	 idea 	 s 	 	.	Can	we	take	what	the	cow	eats	,	 re 	 move 	 	the	cow	,	and	then	make	some	 ham 	 burger 	 s 	 	out	of	that	?
And	 bas 	 ically 	 	the	 re 	 action 	 	 tend 	 s 	 	to	be	kind	of	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 B 	 R 	 	:	Yeah	,	that	's	our	chef	de	 cu 	 is 	 ine 	 	,	Chris	 Jon 	 es 	 	.	 Th 	 is 	 	is	not	the	 on 	 ly 	 	guy	that	just	 flip 	 s 	 	out	when	we	assign	a	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	task	,	but	a	lot	of	these	 idea 	 s 	 	,	they	're	hard	to	understand	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	hard	to	just	get	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	.
There	's	a	lot	of	research	and	a	lot	of	failure	,	trial	and	error	--	I	guess	,	more	error	--	that	 go 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	each	and	every	dish	,	so	we	do	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	get	it	right	,	and	it	 take 	 s 	 	a	while	for	us	to	be	able	to	explain	that	to	people	.
HC	:	So	,	after	about	a	day	of	Chris	and	I	 star 	 ing 	 	at	each	other	,	we	came	up	with	 some 	 thing 	 	that	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	close	to	the	 ham 	 burger 	 	 pat 	 ty 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	it	 bas 	 ically 	 	 form 	 s 	 	like	 ham 	 burger 	 	meat	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	made	from	three	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	:	 bee 	 ts 	 	,	 bar 	 ley 	 	,	corn	,	and	so	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 cook 	 s 	 	up	like	 ham 	 burger 	 	meat	,	 look 	 s 	 	and	 taste 	 s 	 	like	 ham 	 burger 	 	meat	,	and	not	 on 	 ly 	 	that	,	but	it	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	 re 	 moving 	 	the	cow	from	the	 equ 	 ation 	 	.
So	 replica 	 ting 	 	food	,	taking	it	 in 	 to 	 	that	next	level	is	where	we	're	going	.
 B 	 R 	 	:	And	it	's	 definite 	 ly 	 	the	world	's	first	 ble 	 ed 	 ing 	 	veggie	burger	,	which	is	a	cool	side	effect	.
And	a	miracle	berry	,	if	you	're	not	familiar	with	it	,	is	a	natural	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 	,	and	it	 contain 	 s 	 	a	special	 proper 	 ty 	 	.
It	's	a	 glyco 	 protein 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 miracul 	 in 	 	,	a	 natural 	 ly 	 	 occur 	 ring 	 	thing	.	It	still	 freak 	 s 	 	me	out	every	time	I	eat	it	,	but	it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 un 	 ique 	 	ability	to	mask	certain	taste	 receptor 	 s 	 	on	your	tongue	,	so	that	 prim 	 arily 	 	 s 	 our 	 	taste	 receptor 	 s 	 	,	so	 normal 	 ly 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	would	taste	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 our 	 	or	tart	,	 some 	 how 	 	begin	to	taste	 ver 	 y 	 	sweet	.
HC	:	You	're	about	to	eat	a	lemon	,	and	now	it	 taste 	 s 	 	like	 lemon 	 ade 	 	.
Let	's	just	stop	and	think	about	the	economic	 benefit 	 s 	 	of	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	.
We	could	eliminate	sugar	 a 	 cross 	 	the	board	for	all	 confection 	 ary 	 	 product 	 s 	 	and	 soda 	 s 	 	,	and	we	can	replace	it	with	 all 	 - 	 natural 	 	fresh	fruit	.
 B 	 R 	 	:	So	you	see	us	here	cutting	up	some	 water 	 mel 	 on 	 	.	The	idea	with	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	we	're	going	to	eliminate	 ton 	 s 	 	of	food	 mile 	 s 	 	,	 waste 	 d 	 	energy	,	and	 over 	 fish 	 ing 	 	of	tuna	by	creating	tuna	,	or	any	 ex 	 otic 	 	produce	or	item	from	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 far 	 - 	 away 	 	place	,	with	local	,	 organ 	 ic 	 	produce	;	so	we	have	a	 water 	 mel 	 on 	 	from	Wisconsin	.
HC	:	So	if	miracle	berries	take	 s 	 our 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	and	turn	them	 in 	 to 	 	sweet	 thing 	 s 	 	,	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	other	 pi 	 xie 	 	dust	that	we	put	on	the	 water 	 mel 	 on 	 	,	and	it	 make 	 s 	 	it	go	from	sweet	to	 savor 	 y 	 	.
So	after	we	do	that	,	we	put	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	vacuum	bag	,	add	a	little	bit	of	 sea 	 weed 	 	,	some	 spice 	 s 	 	,	and	we	roll	it	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 start 	 s 	 	taking	on	the	 appear 	 ance 	 	of	tuna	.
So	the	key	now	is	to	make	it	 behav 	 e 	 	like	tuna	.
 B 	 R 	 	:	And	then	after	a	quick	dip	 in 	 to 	 	some	liquid	nitrogen	to	get	that	perfect	 s 	 ear 	 	,	we	 re 	 ally 	 	have	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 look 	 s 	 	,	 taste 	 s 	 	and	 behav 	 es 	 	like	the	real	thing	.
HC	:	So	the	key	thing	to	remember	here	is	,	we	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	care	what	 th 	 is 	 	tuna	 re 	 ally 	 	is	.
 A 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	it	's	good	for	you	and	good	for	the	environment	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	.
But	where	is	 th 	 is 	 	going	?
How	can	we	take	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	 trick 	 ing 	 	your	 taste 	 bud 	 s 	 	and	leapfrog	it	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	can	do	 to 	 day 	 	that	could	be	a	 disrupt 	 ive 	 	food	technology	?
So	here	's	the	next	 challeng 	 e 	 	.
I	told	the	staff	,	let	's	just	take	a	bunch	of	wild	 plant 	 s 	 	,	think	of	them	 a 	 s 	 	food	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	.	 A 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	they	're	 non 	 - 	 poison 	 ous 	 	to	the	human	body	,	go	out	around	 Chi 	 cago 	 	 side 	 walk 	 s 	 	,	take	it	,	blend	it	,	cook	it	and	then	have	 every 	 body 	 	 flavor 	 - 	 trip 	 	on	it	at	 Mo 	 to 	 	.
Let	's	charge	them	a	 boat 	 load 	 	of	cash	for	 th 	 is 	 	and	see	what	they	think	.
 B 	 R 	 	:	Yeah	,	so	you	can	imagine	,	a	task	like	 th 	 is 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 assign 	 ments 	 	that	the	kitchen	staff	 hat 	 ed 	 	us	for	.	But	we	 re 	 ally 	 	had	to	 al 	 most 	 	 re 	 learn 	 	how	to	cook	in	general	,	 be 	 cause 	 	these	are	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	plant	life	that	we	're	,	one	,	 un 	 familiar 	 	with	,	and	two	,	we	have	no	 re 	 ference 	 	for	how	to	cook	these	 thing 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	people	do	n't	eat	them	.
So	we	 re 	 ally 	 	had	to	think	about	new	,	creative	ways	to	flavor	,	new	ways	to	cook	and	to	change	 text 	 ure 	 	--	and	that	was	the	main	issue	with	 th 	 is 	 	 challeng 	 e 	 	.
HC	:	So	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	we	step	 in 	 to 	 	the	future	and	we	leapfrog	 a 	 head 	 	.
So	 develop 	 ing 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	and	 first 	 - 	 world 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	,	imagine	if	you	could	take	these	wild	 plant 	 s 	 	and	 consum 	 e 	 	them	,	food	 mile 	 s 	 	would	 bas 	 ically 	 	turn	 in 	 to 	 	food	feet	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 disrupt 	 ive 	 	 ment 	 ality 	 	of	what	food	is	would	 essential 	 ly 	 	open	up	the	encyclopedia	of	what	raw	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	are	,	even	if	we	just	 swap 	 ped 	 	out	,	say	,	one	of	these	for	flour	,	that	would	eliminate	so	much	energy	and	so	much	waste	.
And	to	give	you	a	simple	 ex 	 ample 	 	here	 a 	 s 	 	to	what	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	fed	these	 custom 	 ers 	 	,	there	's	a	bale	of	hay	there	and	some	crab	 apple 	 s 	 	.
And	 bas 	 ically 	 	we	took	hay	and	crab	 apple 	 s 	 	and	made	barbecue	sauce	out	of	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 s 	 	.
People	 s 	 wo 	 re 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	eating	barbecue	sauce	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	free	food	.
 B 	 R 	 	:	 Thank 	 s 	 	,	 guy 	 s 	 	.
When	most	people	think	about	the	 begin 	 ning 	 s 	 	of	AIDS	,	they	're	gon	na	think	back	to	the	1980s	.
And	 certain 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	decade	in	which	we	 discover 	 ed 	 	AIDS	and	the	virus	that	 cause 	 s 	 	it	,	HIV	.
But	in	fact	 th 	 is 	 	virus	 cross 	 ed 	 	over	 in 	 to 	 	 human 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 decade 	 s 	 	before	,	from	 chimpanzee 	 s 	 	,	where	the	virus	 origin 	 ated 	 	,	 in 	 to 	 	 human 	 s 	 	who	hunt	these	 ape 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	photo	was	taken	before	the	Great	 Depressio 	 n 	 	in	Brazzaville	,	 Con 	 go 	 	.
At	 th 	 is 	 	time	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 individual 	 s 	 	,	we	think	,	that	 we 	 re 	 	 infect 	 ed 	 	with	HIV	.
So	I	have	a	couple	of	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 question 	 s 	 	for	you	.
If	 th 	 is 	 	virus	was	in	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 individual 	 s 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	,	why	was	it	the	case	that	it	took	us	 un 	 til 	 	1984	to	be	able	to	discover	 th 	 is 	 	virus	?
 O 	 K 	 	now	,	more	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	had	we	 be 	 en 	 	there	in	the	'40s	and	'50s	,	'60s	,	had	we	 s 	 een 	 	 th 	 is 	 	disease	,	had	we	 under 	 stood 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	was	going	on	with	it	,	how	might	that	have	 change 	 d 	 	and	 complete 	 ly 	 	 transform 	 ed 	 	the	nature	of	the	way	 th 	 is 	 	 pan 	 demic 	 	 move 	 d 	 	?
In	fact	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	 un 	 ique 	 	to	HIV	.	The	vast	 major 	 ity 	 	of	viruses	come	from	 animal 	 s 	 	.
And	you	can	kind	of	think	of	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	pyramid	of	 th 	 is 	 	 bubb 	 ling 	 	up	of	viruses	from	 animal 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	human	 population 	 s 	 	.
But	 on 	 ly 	 	at	the	 ver 	 y 	 	top	of	 th 	 is 	 	pyramid	do	these	 thing 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	human	.
 Never 	 the 	 less 	 	,	we	 s 	 pend 	 	the	vast	 major 	 ity 	 	of	our	energy	focused	on	 th 	 is 	 	level	of	the	pyramid	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	tackle	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 al 	 ready 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	 adapt 	 ed 	 	to	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	that	are	going	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	to	address	--	 a 	 s 	 	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	in	the	case	of	HIV	.
So	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	last	15	 year 	 s 	 	,	I	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	the	 ear 	 lier 	 	 inter 	 face 	 	here	--	what	I	've	 label 	 ed 	 	``	viral	 chat 	 ter 	 	,	''	which	was	a	term	 co 	 in 	 ed 	 	by	my	mentor	Don	 Bur 	 ke 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	idea	that	we	can	 stud 	 y 	 	the	sort	of	 ping 	 ing 	 	of	these	viruses	 in 	 to 	 	human	 population 	 s 	 	,	the	 move 	 ment 	 	of	these	 agent 	 s 	 	over	 in 	 to 	 	 human 	 s 	 	;	and	by	 cap 	 tur 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	moment	,	we	might	be	able	to	move	to	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	where	we	can	catch	them	early	.
 O 	 K 	 	,	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	,	and	I	'm	going	to	show	you	some	 picture 	 s 	 	now	from	the	field	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	of	a	central	African	hunter	.
It	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 fair 	 ly 	 	common	picture	.
One	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	I	want	you	to	note	from	it	is	blood	--	that	you	see	a	tremendous	amount	of	blood	contact	.
 Th 	 is 	 	was	 absolute 	 ly 	 	key	for	us	.	 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 intima 	 te 	 	form	of	 connect 	 ion 	 	.
So	if	we	're	going	to	 stud 	 y 	 	viral	 chat 	 ter 	 	,	we	need	to	get	to	these	 population 	 s 	 	who	have	intensive	contact	with	wild	 animal 	 s 	 	.
And	so	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	people	like	 th 	 is 	 	individual	.
We	collect	blood	from	them	,	other	 specimen 	 s 	 	.
We	look	at	the	 disease 	 s 	 	,	which	are	in	the	 animal 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	the	 human 	 s 	 	.
And	 ideal 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	allow	us	to	catch	these	 thing 	 s 	 	early	on	,	 a 	 s 	 	they	're	moving	over	 in 	 to 	 	human	 population 	 s 	 	.
And	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	 object 	 ive 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	work	is	not	to	just	go	out	once	and	look	at	these	 individual 	 s 	 	,	but	to	establish	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 individual 	 s 	 	in	these	 population 	 s 	 	that	we	would	monitor	 continu 	 ously 	 	on	a	regular	 bas 	 is 	 	.
When	they	 we 	 re 	 	sick	,	we	would	collect	 specimen 	 s 	 	from	them	.
We	would	 actual 	 ly 	 	enlist	them	--	which	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	now	--	to	collect	 specimen 	 s 	 	from	 animal 	 s 	 	.
We	give	them	these	little	 piece 	 s 	 	of	filter	paper	.
When	they	 s 	 ample 	 	from	 animal 	 s 	 	,	they	collect	the	blood	on	the	filter	paper	and	 th 	 is 	 	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	identify	 yet 	 - 	 un 	 known 	 	viruses	from	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	right	 animal 	 s 	 	--	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 hunt 	 ed 	 	.
 Nar 	 rator 	 	:	 De 	 ep 	 	in	a	remote	region	of	Cameroon	,	two	 hunter 	 s 	 	 s 	 talk 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 pre 	 y 	 	.
 T 	 heir 	 	 name 	 s 	 	are	 Pat 	 rice 	 	and	 Pat 	 ee 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	 search 	 ing 	 	for	bush	meat	;	forest	 animal 	 s 	 	they	can	kill	to	feed	 the 	 ir 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	.
 Pat 	 rice 	 	and	 Pat 	 ee 	 	set	out	most	 day 	 s 	 	to	go	out	 hunt 	 ing 	 	in	the	forest	around	 the 	 ir 	 	 home 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	have	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 trap 	 s 	 	,	of	 snare 	 s 	 	that	they	've	set	up	to	catch	wild	 pig 	 s 	 	,	 snake 	 s 	 	,	 monkey 	 s 	 	,	 rod 	 ent 	 s 	 	--	 any 	 thing 	 	they	can	,	 re 	 ally 	 	.
 Pat 	 rice 	 	and	 Pat 	 ee 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	out	for	 hour 	 s 	 	but	found	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
The	 animal 	 s 	 	are	 simpl 	 y 	 	gone	.
We	stop	for	a	drink	of	water	.
 Th 	 en 	 	there	is	a	 rust 	 le 	 	in	the	brush	.
A	group	of	 hunter 	 s 	 	approach	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 pack 	 s 	 	 load 	 ed 	 	with	wild	game	.
There	's	at	 l 	 east 	 	three	viruses	that	you	know	about	,	which	are	in	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	monkey	.

 Th 	 ese 	 	 individual 	 s 	 	are	at	specific	risk	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	if	there	's	blood	contact	,	they	're	at	risk	for	 trans 	 mission 	 	and	possibly	 infect 	 ion 	 	with	novel	viruses	.

 N 	 W 	 	:	 O 	 K 	 	,	before	I	 continu 	 e 	 	,	I	think	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	take	just	a	moment	to	talk	about	bush	meat	.	Bush	meat	is	the	 hunt 	 ing 	 	of	wild	game	.
 O 	 K 	 	?	And	you	can	consider	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	different	bush	meat	.
I	'm	going	to	be	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
When	your	children	and	 grand 	 children 	 	sort	of	pose	 question 	 s 	 	to	you	about	 th 	 is 	 	period	of	time	,	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	they	're	gon	na	ask	you	,	is	how	it	was	they	we	 allow 	 ed 	 	some	of	our	 close 	 st 	 	living	 relat 	 ive 	 s 	 	,	some	of	the	most	 valu 	 able 	 	and	 en 	 danger 	 ed 	 	species	on	our	planet	,	to	go	extinct	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	n't	able	to	address	some	of	the	 issue 	 s 	 	of	poverty	in	these	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	world	.
But	in	fact	that	's	not	the	 on 	 ly 	 	question	they	're	going	to	ask	you	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	 al 	 so 	 	going	to	ask	you	the	question	that	when	we	 k 	 new 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	way	that	HIV	 enter 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	human	population	,	and	that	other	 disease 	 s 	 	had	the	potential	to	enter	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	why	did	we	let	these	 behavior 	 s 	 	 continu 	 e 	 	?
Why	did	we	not	find	some	other	solution	to	 th 	 is 	 	?
 The 	 y 	 	're	going	to	say	,	in	 region 	 s 	 	of	 pro 	 found 	 	 in 	 st 	 ability 	 	 through 	 out 	 	the	world	,	where	you	have	 intens 	 e 	 	poverty	,	where	 population 	 s 	 	are	growing	and	you	do	n't	have	 sustain 	 able 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	lead	to	food	 in 	 security 	 	.
But	they	're	 al 	 so 	 	going	to	ask	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	a	different	question	.
It	's	one	that	I	think	we	all	need	to	ask	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	which	is	,	why	we	thought	the	 respons 	 ibility 	 	 rest 	 ed 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	individual	here	.
 N 	 ow 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	individual	--	you	can	see	just	right	up	over	his	right	shoulder	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	individual	that	 hunt 	 ed 	 	the	monkey	from	the	last	picture	that	I	 show 	 ed 	 	you	.
 O 	 K 	 	,	take	a	look	at	his	shirt	.
You	know	,	take	a	look	at	his	face	.
Bush	meat	is	one	of	the	central	 cri 	 s 	 es 	 	,	which	is	 occur 	 ring 	 	in	our	population	right	now	,	in	 human 	 ity 	 	,	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	.
But	it	ca	n't	be	the	fault	of	 some 	 body 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 O 	 K 	 	?	And	solving	it	can	not	be	his	 respons 	 ibility 	 	 al 	 one 	 	.
There	's	no	easy	 solution 	 s 	 	,	but	what	I	'm	 say 	 ing 	 	to	you	is	that	we	neglect	 th 	 is 	 	problem	at	our	own	peril	.
So	,	in	1998	,	 a 	 long 	 	with	my	 mentor 	 s 	 	Don	 Bur 	 ke 	 	and	 Col 	 on 	 el 	 	 Mpoudi 	 - 	 Ngole 	 	,	we	went	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	start	 th 	 is 	 	work	in	 Cent 	 ral 	 	 Afri 	 ca 	 	,	to	work	with	 hunter 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	part	of	the	world	.
And	my	job	--	at	that	time	I	was	a	 post 	 - 	 doctor 	 al 	 	fellow	,	and	I	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 task 	 ed 	 	with	setting	 th 	 is 	 	up	.
So	I	 s 	 aid 	 	to	 my 	 self 	 	,	``	 O 	 K 	 	,	great	--	we	're	gon	na	collect	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 specimen 	 s 	 	.	We	're	gon	na	go	to	all	these	different	 location 	 s 	 	.	It	's	going	to	be	 wonder 	 ful 	 	.	''
You	know	,	I	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	map	;	I	 pick 	 ed 	 	out	17	 s 	 ites 	 	;	I	 figur 	 ed 	 	,	no	problem	.
 Needle 	 s 	 s 	 	to	say	,	I	was	 drastic 	 ally 	 	wrong	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 challeng 	 ing 	 	work	to	do	.
 Fort 	 un 	 ate 	 ly 	 	,	I	had	and	 continu 	 e 	 	to	have	an	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	team	of	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	and	 collabor 	 ators 	 	in	my	own	team	,	and	that	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	that	 th 	 is 	 	work	can	 re 	 ally 	 	occur	.
We	have	a	whole	range	of	 challeng 	 es 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	work	.
One	of	them	is	just	 obtain 	 ing 	 	trust	from	 individual 	 s 	 	that	we	work	with	in	the	field	.
The	person	you	see	on	the	right	hand	side	is	Paul	 De 	 Long 	 - 	 Minutu 	 	.
He	's	one	of	the	best	 communicator 	 s 	 	that	I	've	 re 	 ally 	 	ever	 deal 	 t 	 	with	.
When	I	 arriv 	 ed 	 	I	did	n't	speak	a	word	of	French	,	and	I	still	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	understand	what	it	was	he	was	 say 	 ing 	 	.
Paul	 work 	 ed 	 	for	 year 	 s 	 	on	the	 Cameroon 	 ian 	 	national	radio	and	 tele 	 vision 	 	,	and	he	spoke	about	health	 issue 	 s 	 	.	He	was	a	health	 correspond 	 ent 	 	.
So	we	 figur 	 ed 	 	we	'd	hire	 th 	 is 	 	person	--	when	we	got	there	he	could	be	a	great	communicator	.
When	we	would	get	to	these	 r 	 ural 	 	 village 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	what	we	found	out	is	that	no	one	had	 tele 	 vision 	 	,	so	they	would	n't	 recogn 	 ize 	 	his	face	.
But	--	when	he	 beg 	 an 	 	to	speak	they	would	 actual 	 ly 	 	 recogn 	 ize 	 	his	voice	from	the	radio	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	was	 some 	 body 	 	who	had	 in 	 credible 	 	potential	to	spread	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	of	our	 mess 	 age 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	be	with	 regard 	 s 	 	to	 wild 	 life 	 	 conserv 	 ation 	 	or	health	 prevent 	 ion 	 	.
 Of 	 ten 	 	we	run	 in 	 to 	 	 obstacle 	 s 	 	.	 Th 	 is 	 	is	us	coming	back	from	one	of	these	 ver 	 y 	 	 r 	 ural 	 	 s 	 ites 	 	,	with	 specimen 	 s 	 	from	200	 individual 	 s 	 	that	we	 need 	 ed 	 	to	get	back	to	the	lab	 with 	 in 	 	48	 hour 	 s 	 	.
I	like	to	show	 th 	 is 	 	shot	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	 U 	 bald 	 	Tamoufe	,	who	's	the	lead	 invest 	 igator 	 	in	our	Cameroon	 s 	 ite 	 	.
 U 	 bald 	 	 laugh 	 s 	 	at	me	when	I	show	 th 	 is 	 	photo	 be 	 cause 	 	of	course	you	ca	n't	see	his	face	.
But	the	reason	I	like	to	show	the	shot	is	 be 	 cause 	 	you	can	see	that	he	's	about	to	solve	 th 	 is 	 	problem	.
 Whi 	 ch 	 	--	which	he	did	,	which	he	did	.
Just	a	few	quick	before	and	after	 shot 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	was	our	 labor 	 atory 	 	before	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	now	.
 Ear 	 ly 	 	on	,	in	order	to	ship	our	 specimen 	 s 	 	,	we	had	to	have	dry	ice	.	To	get	dry	ice	we	had	to	go	to	the	 brew 	 eries 	 	--	beg	,	borrow	,	steal	to	get	these	 folk 	 s 	 	to	give	it	to	us	.
 N 	 ow 	 	we	have	our	own	liquid	nitrogen	.
I	like	to	call	our	 labor 	 atory 	 	the	 cold 	 est 	 	place	in	 Cent 	 ral 	 	 Afri 	 ca 	 	--	it	might	be	.
And	here	's	a	shot	of	me	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	before	shot	of	me	.
No	comment	.
So	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	?	So	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	10	 year 	 s 	 	that	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	work	,	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	 surprise 	 d 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
We	made	a	number	of	 discover 	 ies 	 	.
And	what	we	've	found	is	that	if	you	look	in	the	right	place	,	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	monitor	the	flow	of	these	viruses	 in 	 to 	 	human	 population 	 s 	 	.
That	 g 	 ave 	 	us	a	tremendous	amount	of	hope	.
What	we	've	found	is	a	whole	range	of	new	viruses	in	these	 individual 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	new	viruses	in	the	same	group	 a 	 s 	 	HIV	--	so	,	brand	new	 retro 	 viruses 	 	.
And	let	's	face	it	,	any	new	 retro 	 virus 	 	in	the	human	population	--	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	we	should	be	aware	of	.
It	's	 some 	 thing 	 	we	should	be	 follow 	 ing 	 	.	It	's	not	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	should	be	 surprise 	 d 	 	by	.
 Needle 	 s 	 s 	 	to	say	in	the	past	these	viruses	 enter 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	these	 r 	 ural 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	might	 ver 	 y 	 	well	have	gone	extinct	.
That	's	no	 long 	 er 	 	the	case	.	 Lo 	 gg 	 ing 	 	 road 	 s 	 	provide	access	to	urban	 area 	 s 	 	.
And	 critical 	 ly 	 	,	what	 happen 	 s 	 	in	central	 Afri 	 ca 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	stay	in	 Cent 	 ral 	 	 Afri 	 ca 	 	.
So	,	once	we	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	possible	that	we	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	 th 	 is 	 	 monitor 	 ing 	 	,	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	move	 th 	 is 	 	from	research	,	to	 re 	 ally 	 	attempt	to	phase	up	to	a	global	 monitor 	 ing 	 	effort	.
 Th 	 rough 	 	 gen 	 er 	 ous 	 	support	and	 partner 	 ship 	 	 scientific 	 ally 	 	with	 Google 	 .org 	 	and	the	Skoll	 Found 	 ation 	 	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	start	the	Global	 Vi 	 ral 	 	 Fore 	 cast 	 ing 	 	 In 	 iti 	 ative 	 	and	begin	work	in	four	different	 s 	 ites 	 	in	 Afri 	 ca 	 	and	Asia	.
 Needle 	 s 	 s 	 	to	say	,	different	 population 	 s 	 	from	different	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	world	have	different	 sort 	 s 	 	of	contact	.
So	it	's	not	just	 hunter 	 s 	 	in	 Cent 	 ral 	 	 Afri 	 ca 	 	.
It	's	 al 	 so 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	in	live	animal	 market 	 s 	 	--	these	wet	 market 	 s 	 	--	which	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	place	where	 SA 	 RS 	 	 emerge 	 d 	 	in	Asia	.
But	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	from	our	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	.
Our	 object 	 ive 	 	right	now	,	in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	 deploy 	 ing 	 	to	these	 s 	 ites 	 	and	 get 	 ting 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	moving	,	is	to	identify	new	 partner 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	feel	like	 th 	 is 	 	effort	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	 extend 	 ed 	 	to	 prob 	 ably 	 	20	or	more	 s 	 ites 	 	 through 	 out 	 	the	world	--	to	viral	 hot 	 spot 	 s 	 	--	 be 	 cause 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	the	idea	here	is	to	cast	an	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	wide	net	so	that	we	can	catch	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 ideal 	 ly 	 	,	before	they	make	it	to	blood	 bank 	 s 	 	,	sexual	 network 	 s 	 	,	 air 	 plane 	 s 	 	.	And	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	our	 object 	 ive 	 	.
There	was	a	time	not	 ver 	 y 	 	long	ago	when	the	 discover 	 y 	 	of	 un 	 known 	 	 organism 	 s 	 	was	 some 	 thing 	 	that	held	 in 	 credible 	 	awe	for	us	.
It	had	potential	to	 re 	 ally 	 	change	the	way	that	we	saw	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	and	thought	about	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
 Man 	 y 	 	people	,	I	think	,	on	our	planet	right	now	despair	,	and	they	think	we	've	 reach 	 ed 	 	a	point	where	we	've	 discover 	 ed 	 	most	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	.
I	'm	going	tell	you	right	now	:	 pleas 	 e 	 	do	n't	despair	.
If	an	intelligent	 extra 	 - 	 terrestrial 	 	was	 tax 	 ed 	 	with	writing	the	encyclopedia	of	life	on	our	planet	,	27	out	of	30	of	these	 volume 	 s 	 	would	be	 devote 	 d 	 	to	bacteria	and	virus	,	with	just	a	few	of	the	 volume 	 s 	 	left	for	 plant 	 s 	 	,	fungus	and	 animal 	 s 	 	,	 human 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	a	 foot 	 note 	 	;	 interest 	 ing 	 	 foot 	 note 	 	but	a	 foot 	 note 	 	 non 	 e 	 the 	 less 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 honest 	 ly 	 	the	most	 excit 	 ing 	 	period	ever	for	the	 stud 	 y 	 	of	 un 	 known 	 	life	 form 	 s 	 	on	our	planet	.
The	 domin 	 ant 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	exist	here	we	know	 al 	 most 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	about	.
And	yet	 final 	 ly 	 	,	we	have	the	 tool 	 s 	 	,	which	will	allow	us	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	explore	that	world	and	understand	them	.
Thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
 Hell 	 o 	 	!	My	name	is	 Go 	 lan 	 	 Lev 	 in 	 	.
I	'm	an	artist	and	an	engineer	,	which	is	,	 increasing 	 ly 	 	,	a	more	common	kind	of	hybrid	.
But	I	still	fall	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	weird	crack	where	people	do	n't	seem	to	understand	me	.
And	I	was	looking	around	and	I	found	 th 	 is 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	picture	.
It	's	a	letter	from	``	 Art 	 forum 	 	''	in	1967	 say 	 ing 	 	``	We	ca	n't	imagine	ever	 do 	 ing 	 	a	special	issue	on	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	or	 computer 	 s 	 	in	art	.	''	And	they	still	have	n't	.
And	 l 	 est 	 	you	think	that	you	all	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	 dig 	 e 	 rati 	 	,	are	more	 enlighten 	 ed 	 	,	I	went	to	the	Apple	 i 	 Phone 	 	app	store	the	other	day	.
Where	's	art	?	I	got	 product 	 ivity 	 	.	I	got	 s 	 port 	 s 	 	.
And	 some 	 how 	 	the	idea	that	one	would	want	to	make	art	for	the	 i 	 Phone 	 	,	which	my	 friend 	 s 	 	and	I	are	 do 	 ing 	 	now	,	is	still	not	 reflect 	 ed 	 	in	our	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	what	 computer 	 s 	 	are	for	.
So	,	from	both	 direction 	 s 	 	,	there	is	kind	of	,	I	think	,	a	lack	of	 understand 	 ing 	 	about	what	it	could	mean	to	be	an	artist	who	uses	the	 material 	 s 	 	of	his	own	day	,	or	her	own	day	,	which	I	think	 artist 	 s 	 	are	 oblig 	 ed 	 	to	do	,	is	to	 re 	 ally 	 	explore	the	 express 	 ive 	 	potential	of	the	new	 tool 	 s 	 	that	we	have	.
In	my	own	case	,	I	'm	an	artist	,	and	I	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 expand 	 ing 	 	the	 vocabul 	 ary 	 	of	human	action	,	and	 bas 	 ically 	 	 empower 	 ing 	 	people	through	 inter 	 activity 	 	.
I	want	people	to	discover	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 act 	 ors 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	creative	 act 	 ors 	 	,	by	 hav 	 ing 	 	 inter 	 active 	 	 experience 	 s 	 	.
A	lot	of	my	work	is	about	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	away	from	 th 	 is 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	a	photograph	of	the	 desk 	 top 	 	of	a	student	of	mine	.
And	when	I	say	 desk 	 top 	 	,	I	do	n't	just	mean	the	actual	desk	where	his	mouse	 ha 	 s 	 	worn	away	the	surface	of	the	desk	.
If	you	look	 care 	 fully 	 	,	you	can	even	see	a	hint	of	the	Apple	menu	,	up	here	in	the	upper	left	,	where	the	virtual	world	 ha 	 s 	 	 liter 	 ally 	 	 punch 	 ed 	 	through	to	the	physical	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	 a 	 s 	 	 Jo 	 y 	 	 Mount 	 ford 	 	once	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	The	mouse	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	 narrow 	 est 	 	straw	you	could	try	to	suck	all	of	human	 express 	 ion 	 	through	.	''
And	the	thing	I	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	is	 enabl 	 ing 	 	people	to	have	more	rich	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 inter 	 active 	 	 experience 	 s 	 	.
How	can	we	get	away	from	the	mouse	and	use	our	full	bodies	 a 	 s 	 	a	way	of	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	aesthetic	 experience 	 s 	 	,	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	 util 	 itarian 	 	 one 	 s 	 	.
So	I	write	 soft 	 ware 	 	.	And	that	's	how	I	do	it	.
And	a	lot	of	my	 experience 	 s 	 	resemble	 mirror 	 s 	 	in	some	way	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	in	some	sense	,	the	first	way	,	that	people	discover	 the 	 ir 	 	own	potential	 a 	 s 	 	 act 	 ors 	 	,	and	discover	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 age 	 ncy 	 	.
By	 say 	 ing 	 	``	Who	is	that	person	in	the	mirror	?	Oh	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	me	.	''
And	so	,	to	give	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	project	from	last	year	,	which	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 Inter 	 stit 	 ial 	 	 F 	 rag 	 ment 	 	 Pro 	 cess 	 or 	 	.
And	it	 allow 	 s 	 	people	to	explore	the	negative	 shape 	 s 	 	that	they	create	when	they	're	just	going	about	 the 	 ir 	 	 every 	 day 	 	business	.
So	 a 	 s 	 	people	make	 shape 	 s 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	or	 the 	 ir 	 	 head 	 s 	 	and	so	forth	,	or	with	each	other	,	these	 shape 	 s 	 	 liter 	 ally 	 	produce	 sound 	 s 	 	and	drop	out	of	thin	air	--	 bas 	 ically 	 	taking	what	's	often	 th 	 is 	 	,	kind	of	,	 un 	 s 	 een 	 	space	,	or	 th 	 is 	 	 un 	 detect 	 ed 	 	space	,	and	making	it	 some 	 thing 	 	real	,	that	people	then	can	appreciate	and	 be 	 come 	 	creative	with	.
So	 aga 	 in 	 	,	people	discover	 the 	 ir 	 	creative	 age 	 ncy 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
And	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 personal 	 ities 	 	come	out	in	 total 	 ly 	 	 un 	 ique 	 	ways	.
So	in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	using	 full 	 - 	 body 	 	 in 	 put 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	I	've	 explore 	 d 	 	now	,	for	a	while	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	the	use	of	the	voice	,	which	is	an	 immense 	 ly 	 	 express 	 ive 	 	system	for	us	,	 vocal 	 izing 	 	.
Song	is	one	of	our	 old 	 est 	 	ways	of	making	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	heard	and	 under 	 stood 	 	.
And	I	came	 a 	 cross 	 	 th 	 is 	 	fantastic	research	by	 Wolf 	 gang 	 	Köhler	,	the	 so 	 - 	 call 	 ed 	 	father	of	 gest 	 alt 	 	 psycho 	 logy 	 	,	from	1927	,	who	 submit 	 ted 	 	to	an	audience	like	 your 	 s 	 elves 	 	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	two	 shape 	 s 	 	.
And	he	 s 	 aid 	 	one	of	them	is	 call 	 ed 	 	 Mal 	 uma 	 	.
And	one	of	them	is	 call 	 ed 	 	 Take 	 ta 	 	.	 Whi 	 ch 	 	is	which	?
 Any 	 one 	 	want	to	hazard	a	guess	?
 Mal 	 uma 	 	is	on	top	.	Yeah	.	So	.
 A 	 s 	 	he	 say 	 s 	 	here	,	most	people	answer	 with 	 out 	 	any	 hesit 	 ation 	 	.
So	what	we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	here	is	a	 phenomen 	 on 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 phon 	 a 	 est 	 hesia 	 	,	which	is	a	kind	of	 synest 	 hesia 	 	that	all	of	you	have	.
And	so	,	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	 Dr 	 . 	 	 O 	 liver 	 	Sacks	 ha 	 s 	 	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	how	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	one	person	in	a	million	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	true	 synest 	 hesia 	 	,	where	they	hear	 color 	 s 	 	or	taste	 shape 	 s 	 	,	and	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	 phon 	 a 	 est 	 hesia 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	we	can	all	experience	to	some	 ex 	 tent 	 	.
It	's	about	 mapping 	 s 	 	between	different	 per 	 cept 	 ual 	 	 domain 	 s 	 	,	like	 hard 	 ness 	 	,	 sharp 	 ness 	 	,	 bright 	 ness 	 	and	 dark 	 ness 	 	,	and	the	 phone 	 me 	 s 	 	that	we	're	able	to	speak	with	.
So	70	 year 	 s 	 	on	,	there	's	 be 	 en 	 	some	research	where	cognitive	 psycho 	 logists 	 	have	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 us 	 s 	 ed 	 	out	the	 ex 	 tent 	 	to	which	,	you	know	,	L	,	M	and	B	are	more	 associate 	 d 	 	with	 shape 	 s 	 	that	look	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	P	,	T	and	K	are	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	more	 associate 	 d 	 	with	 shape 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
And	here	we	 sudden 	 ly 	 	begin	to	have	a	mapping	between	 curv 	 ature 	 	that	we	can	exploit	 numeric 	 ally 	 	,	a	 relat 	 ive 	 	mapping	between	 curv 	 ature 	 	and	shape	.
So	it	 occur 	 red 	 	to	me	,	what	 happen 	 s 	 	if	we	could	run	these	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	?
And	thus	was	born	the	project	 call 	 ed 	 	 Re 	 mark 	 	,	which	is	a	 collabor 	 ation 	 	with	 Z 	 ach 	 ary 	 	 Lie 	 ber 	 man 	 	and	the	 Ar 	 s 	 	 Electro 	 nic 	 a 	 	 Future 	 lab 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 inter 	 active 	 	 install 	 ation 	 	which	 present 	 s 	 	the	fiction	that	speech	 cast 	 s 	 	visible	 shadow 	 s 	 	.
So	the	idea	is	you	step	 in 	 to 	 	a	kind	of	a	magic	light	.
And	 a 	 s 	 	you	do	,	you	see	the	 shadow 	 s 	 	of	your	own	speech	.
And	they	sort	of	fly	away	,	out	of	your	head	.
If	a	computer	speech	 re 	 cognition 	 	system	is	able	to	 recogn 	 ize 	 	what	you	're	 say 	 ing 	 	,	then	it	 spell 	 s 	 	it	out	.
And	if	it	is	n't	then	it	 produce 	 s 	 	a	shape	which	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 phon 	 aesthetic 	 ally 	 	 tight 	 ly 	 	 couple 	 d 	 	to	the	 sound 	 s 	 	you	made	.
So	let	's	 br 	 ing 	 	up	a	video	of	that	.
 Thank 	 s 	 	.	So	.	And	 th 	 is 	 	project	here	,	I	was	 work 	 ing 	 	with	the	great	abstract	 vocal 	 ist 	 	,	 Ja 	 ap 	 	Blonk	.
And	he	is	a	world	expert	in	 perform 	 ing 	 	``	The	 Ur 	 son 	 ate 	 	,	''	which	is	a	 half 	 - 	 an 	 - 	 hour 	 	 non 	 sense 	 	poem	by	 Kur 	 t 	 	 Sch 	 wit 	 ter 	 s 	 	,	written	in	the	1920s	,	which	is	half	an	hour	of	 ver 	 y 	 	 high 	 ly 	 	 pattern 	 ed 	 	 non 	 sense 	 	.
And	it	's	 al 	 most 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	to	perform	.
But	 Ja 	 ap 	 	is	one	of	the	world	 expert 	 s 	 	in	 perform 	 ing 	 	it	.
And	in	 th 	 is 	 	project	we	've	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	form	of	intelligent	 real 	 - 	 time 	 	 sub 	 title 	 s 	 	.
So	these	are	our	live	 sub 	 title 	 s 	 	,	that	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 produce 	 d 	 	by	a	computer	that	 know 	 s 	 	the	text	of	``	The	 Ur 	 son 	 ate 	 	''	--	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	 Ja 	 ap 	 	 do 	 es 	 	too	,	 ver 	 y 	 	well	--	and	it	is	 deliver 	 ing 	 	that	text	at	the	same	time	 a 	 s 	 	 Ja 	 ap 	 	is	.
So	all	the	text	you	're	going	to	see	is	 real 	 - 	 time 	 	generated	by	the	computer	,	 visual 	 izing 	 	what	he	's	 do 	 ing 	 	with	his	voice	.
 He 	 re 	 	you	can	see	the	 set 	 - 	 up 	 	where	there	is	a	screen	with	the	 sub 	 title 	 s 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	him	.
 Oka 	 y 	 	.	So	...
The	full	 video 	 s 	 	are	 on 	 line 	 	if	you	are	 interest 	 ed 	 	.
I	got	a	split	 re 	 action 	 	to	that	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	live	performance	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	is	some	people	who	understand	live	 sub 	 title 	 s 	 	are	a	kind	of	an	 oxy 	 moron 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 usual 	 ly 	 	there	is	 some 	 one 	 	making	them	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	.
And	then	a	bunch	of	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	like	,	``	What	's	the	big	deal	?
I	see	 sub 	 title 	 s 	 	all	the	time	on	 tele 	 vision 	 	.	''
You	know	?	 The 	 y 	 	do	n't	imagine	the	person	in	the	booth	,	 ty 	 ping 	 	it	all	.
So	in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	the	full	body	,	and	in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	the	voice	,	 an 	 other 	 	thing	that	I	've	 be 	 en 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	,	most	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	is	the	use	of	the	 eye 	 s 	 	,	or	the	 gaz 	 e 	 	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	how	people	 re 	 late 	 	to	each	other	.
It	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 pro 	 found 	 	amount	of	 non 	 verbal 	 	information	that	's	 communicate 	 d 	 	with	the	 eye 	 s 	 	.
And	it	's	one	of	the	most	 interest 	 ing 	 	technical	 challeng 	 es 	 	that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 current 	 ly 	 	active	in	the	computer	 science 	 s 	 	:	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	have	a	camera	that	can	understand	,	from	a	 fair 	 ly 	 	big	distance	away	,	how	these	little	 tin 	 y 	 	 ball 	 s 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 point 	 ing 	 	in	one	way	or	 an 	 other 	 	to	reveal	what	you	're	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	,	and	where	your	attention	is	 direct 	 ed 	 	.
So	there	is	a	lot	of	 emotion 	 al 	 	communication	that	 happen 	 s 	 	there	.
And	so	I	've	 be 	 en 	 	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	with	a	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	different	 project 	 s 	 	,	to	understand	how	people	can	 re 	 late 	 	to	 machine 	 s 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	.
And	 bas 	 ically 	 	to	ask	the	 question 	 s 	 	:	What	if	art	was	aware	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	looking	at	it	?
How	could	it	respond	,	in	a	way	,	to	 acknowledg 	 e 	 	or	 sub 	 vert 	 	the	fact	that	we	're	looking	at	it	?
And	what	could	it	do	if	it	could	look	back	at	us	?
And	so	 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	 question 	 s 	 	that	are	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	the	next	 project 	 s 	 	.
In	the	first	one	which	I	'm	going	to	show	you	,	 call 	 ed 	 	 Eye 	 code 	 	,	it	's	a	piece	of	 inter 	 active 	 	 soft 	 ware 	 	in	which	,	if	we	read	 th 	 is 	 	little	circle	,	``	the	trace	left	by	the	looking	of	the	previous	 observ 	 er 	 	 look 	 s 	 	at	the	trace	left	by	the	looking	of	previous	 observ 	 er 	 	.	''
The	idea	is	that	it	's	an	image	 who 	 lly 	 	 construct 	 ed 	 	from	 it 	 s 	 	own	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 view 	 ed 	 	by	different	people	in	an	 install 	 ation 	 	.
So	let	me	just	 s 	 witch 	 	over	so	we	can	do	the	live	demo	.
So	let	's	run	 th 	 is 	 	and	see	if	it	 work 	 s 	 	.
 Oka 	 y 	 	.	Ah	,	there	is	 lot 	 s 	 	of	nice	bright	video	.
There	is	just	a	little	test	screen	that	 show 	 s 	 	that	it	's	 work 	 ing 	 	.
And	what	I	'm	just	going	to	do	is	--	I	'm	going	to	hide	that	.
And	you	can	see	here	that	what	it	's	 do 	 ing 	 	is	it	's	 record 	 ing 	 	my	 eye 	 s 	 	every	time	I	blink	.
 Hell 	 o 	 	?	And	I	can	...	 hell 	 o 	 	...	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
And	no	matter	where	I	am	,	what	's	 re 	 ally 	 	going	on	here	is	that	it	's	an	 eye 	 - 	 track 	 ing 	 	system	that	tries	to	locate	my	 eye 	 s 	 	.
And	if	I	get	 re 	 ally 	 	far	away	I	'm	 blur 	 ry 	 	.
You	know	,	you	're	going	to	have	these	kind	of	 blur 	 ry 	 	 spot 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	that	 may 	 be 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	resemble	 eye 	 s 	 	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	abstract	way	.
But	if	I	come	up	 re 	 ally 	 	close	and	 star 	 e 	 	 direct 	 ly 	 	at	the	camera	on	 th 	 is 	 	 lap 	 top 	 	then	you	'll	see	these	nice	crisp	 eye 	 s 	 	.
You	can	think	of	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	way	of	,	sort	of	,	 ty 	 ping 	 	,	with	your	 eye 	 s 	 	.
And	what	you	're	 ty 	 ping 	 	are	 record 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	your	 eye 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	you	're	looking	at	other	 people 	 s 	 	'	 eye 	 s 	 	.
So	each	person	is	looking	at	the	looking	of	 every 	 one 	 	else	before	them	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	 exist 	 s 	 	in	 large 	 r 	 	 install 	 ations 	 	where	there	are	 thousand 	 s 	 	and	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 eye 	 s 	 	that	people	could	be	 star 	 ing 	 	at	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	see	who	's	looking	at	the	people	looking	at	the	people	looking	before	them	.
So	I	'll	just	add	a	couple	more	.	 B 	 link 	 	.	 B 	 link 	 	.
And	you	can	see	,	just	once	 aga 	 in 	 	,	how	it	's	sort	of	 find 	 ing 	 	my	 eye 	 s 	 	and	 do 	 ing 	 	 it 	 s 	 	best	to	estimate	when	it	's	 blink 	 ing 	 	.
 Al 	 right 	 	.	Let	's	 leav 	 e 	 	that	.
So	that	's	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 recur 	 s 	 ive 	 	 observ 	 ation 	 	system	.
Thank	you	.
The	last	couple	 piece 	 s 	 	I	'm	going	to	show	are	 bas 	 ically 	 	in	the	new	realm	of	 robotic 	 s 	 	--	for	me	,	new	for	me	.
It	's	 call 	 ed 	 	 Opt 	 o 	 - 	 I 	 s 	 ol 	 ator 	 	.
And	I	'm	going	to	show	a	video	of	the	 old 	 er 	 	version	of	it	,	which	is	just	a	minute	long	.	 Oka 	 y 	 	.
In	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	the	 Opt 	 o 	 - 	 I 	 s 	 ol 	 ator 	 	is	 blink 	 ing 	 	in	 respons 	 e 	 	to	one	's	own	 blink 	 s 	 	.
So	it	 blink 	 s 	 	one	second	after	you	do	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	 de 	 vice 	 	which	is	 intend 	 ed 	 	to	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	 phenomen 	 on 	 	of	 gaz 	 e 	 	down	to	the	 simpl 	 est 	 	possible	 material 	 s 	 	.
Just	one	eye	,	looking	at	you	,	and	 elimi 	 nating 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	else	about	a	face	,	but	just	to	consider	 gaz 	 e 	 	in	an	 isolate 	 d 	 	way	 a 	 s 	 	a	kind	of	,	 a 	 s 	 	an	element	.
And	at	the	same	time	,	it	 attempt 	 s 	 	to	engage	in	what	you	might	call	familiar	 psycho 	 - 	 social 	 	 gaz 	 e 	 	 behavior 	 s 	 	.
Like	looking	away	if	you	look	at	it	too	long	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 get 	 s 	 	 s 	 hy 	 	,	or	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	.
 Oka 	 y 	 	.	So	the	last	project	I	'm	going	to	show	is	 th 	 is 	 	new	one	 call 	 ed 	 	 Sn 	 out 	 	.
It	's	an	 eight 	 - 	 foot 	 	snout	,	with	a	 go 	 og 	 ly 	 	eye	.
And	 in 	 side 	 	it	's	got	an	800-pound	robot	arm	that	I	 borrow 	 ed 	 	,	from	a	friend	.
It	 help 	 s 	 	to	have	good	 friend 	 s 	 	.
I	'm	at	 Car 	 neg 	 ie 	 	 Mello 	 n 	 	;	we	've	got	a	great	 Robot 	 ic 	 s 	 	Institute	there	.
I	'd	like	to	show	you	thing	 call 	 ed 	 	 Sn 	 out 	 	,	which	is	--	The	idea	 be 	 hind 	 	 th 	 is 	 	project	is	to	make	a	robot	that	 appear 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	if	it	's	 continu 	 ally 	 	 surprise 	 d 	 	to	see	you	.
The	idea	is	that	 bas 	 ically 	 	--	if	it	's	 constant 	 ly 	 	like	``	 Hu 	 h 	 	?	...	 Hu 	 h 	 	?	''
That	's	why	 it 	 s 	 	other	name	is	 Double 	 taker 	 	,	 Take 	 r 	 	of	 Double 	 s 	 	.
It	's	 al 	 ways 	 	kind	of	 do 	 ing 	 	a	double	take	:	``	What	?	''
And	the	idea	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	can	it	look	at	you	and	make	you	feel	 a 	 s 	 	if	like	,	``	What	?	 I 	 s 	 	it	my	 shoe 	 s 	 	?	''
``	Got	 some 	 thing 	 	on	my	hair	?	''	 He 	 re 	 	we	go	.	 Al 	 right 	 	.
 Check 	 ing 	 	him	out	...
For	you	 nerd 	 s 	 	,	here	's	a	little	 be 	 hind 	 - 	 the 	 - 	 scene 	 s 	 	.
It	's	got	a	computer	vision	system	,	and	it	tries	to	look	at	the	people	who	are	moving	around	the	most	.
 T 	 hose 	 	are	 it 	 s 	 	 target 	 s 	 	.
Up	there	is	the	skeleton	,	which	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	what	it	's	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	.
It	's	 re 	 ally 	 	about	 try 	 ing 	 	to	create	a	novel	body	language	for	a	new	creature	.
 Hol 	 ly 	 wood 	 	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	all	the	time	,	of	course	.
But	 al 	 so 	 	have	the	body	language	communicate	 some 	 thing 	 	to	the	person	who	is	looking	at	it	.
 Th 	 is 	 	language	is	 commun 	 ic 	 ating 	 	that	it	is	 surprise 	 d 	 	to	see	you	,	and	it	's	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	looking	at	you	.
Thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.	That	's	all	I	've	got	for	 to 	 day 	 	.
And	I	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	happy	to	be	here	.	Thank	you	so	much	.
Four	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	on	the	TED	stage	,	I	 announce 	 d 	 	a	company	I	was	 work 	 ing 	 	with	at	the	time	 call 	 ed 	 	Odeo	.
And	 be 	 cause 	 	of	that	 announce 	 ment 	 	,	we	got	a	big	article	in	the	New	York	 Time 	 s 	 	,	which	led	to	more	press	,	which	led	to	more	attention	,	and	me	 dec 	 id 	 ing 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	CEO	of	that	company	--	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	I	was	just	an	 advise 	 r 	 	--	and	raising	a	round	of	venture	capital	and	 ramp 	 ing 	 	up	 hir 	 ing 	 	.
One	of	the	 guy 	 s 	 	I	 hire 	 d 	 	was	an	engineer	named	Jack	 Do 	 rse 	 y 	 	,	and	a	year	 lat 	 er 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	decide	which	way	to	go	with	Odeo	,	and	Jack	 present 	 ed 	 	an	idea	he	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 tinker 	 ing 	 	around	with	for	a	number	of	 year 	 s 	 	that	was	based	around	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	simple	 stat 	 us 	 	 update 	 s 	 	to	 friend 	 s 	 	.
We	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	with	 S 	 MS 	 	at	the	time	at	Odeo	,	so	we	kind	of	put	two	and	two	together	,	and	in	early	2006	we	 launch 	 ed 	 	Twitter	 a 	 s 	 	a	side	project	at	Odeo	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	it	's	hard	to	 just 	 ify 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	a	side	project	at	a	 start 	 up 	 	,	where	focus	is	so	critical	,	but	I	had	 actual 	 ly 	 	 launch 	 ed 	 	 Blog 	 ger 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	side	project	to	my	previous	company	,	 think 	 ing 	 	it	was	just	a	little	thing	we	'd	do	on	the	side	,	and	it	 end 	 ed 	 	up	taking	over	not	 on 	 ly 	 	the	company	,	but	my	life	over	the	next	five	or	six	 year 	 s 	 	.
So	I	 learn 	 ed 	 	to	follow	 hunch 	 es 	 	even	 th 	 ough 	 	you	ca	n't	 necess 	 arily 	 	 just 	 ify 	 	them	or	know	where	they	're	going	to	go	.
And	that	's	kind	of	what	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	with	Twitter	,	time	after	time	.
So	,	for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	 un 	 familiar 	 	,	Twitter	is	based	around	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	,	 seem 	 ing 	 ly 	 	trivial	 con 	 cept 	 	.
You	say	what	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	in	140	 character 	 s 	 	or	less	,	and	people	who	are	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	you	get	 t 	 hose 	 	 update 	 s 	 	.
If	they	're	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	,	they	get	the	update	 a 	 s 	 	a	text	 mess 	 age 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	cell	phone	.
So	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	I	may	Twitter	right	now	that	I	'm	giving	a	talk	at	TED	.
It	's	a	normal	 every 	 day 	 	thing	.
And	in	my	case	,	when	I	hit	 s 	 end 	 	,	up	to	60,000	people	will	 receiv 	 e 	 	that	 mess 	 age 	 	in	a	matter	of	 second 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	the	fundamental	idea	is	that	Twitter	lets	people	share	 moment 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	 when 	 ever 	 	they	want	,	be	they	 moment 	 ous 	 	 occasion 	 s 	 	or	mundane	 one 	 s 	 	.
It	is	by	sharing	these	 moment 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	're	 happen 	 ing 	 	that	lets	people	feel	more	 connect 	 ed 	 	and	in	touch	,	 de 	 spite 	 	distance	,	and	in	real	time	.
 Th 	 is 	 	was	the	 prim 	 ary 	 	use	we	saw	for	Twitter	from	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	and	what	got	us	 excit 	 ed 	 	.
What	we	did	n't	 anticip 	 ate 	 	was	the	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	other	uses	that	would	evolve	from	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	system	.
One	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	 real 	 ized 	 	was	how	 import 	 ant 	 	Twitter	could	be	 dur 	 ing 	 	 real 	 - 	 time 	 	 event 	 s 	 	.
When	the	 wild 	 fire 	 s 	 	broke	out	in	San	 Di 	 ego 	 	,	in	 Oct 	 ob 	 er 	 	of	2007	,	people	 turn 	 ed 	 	to	Twitter	to	report	what	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	and	to	find	information	from	 neighbor 	 s 	 	about	what	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	around	them	.
But	it	was	n't	just	 individual 	 s 	 	.
The	 L. 	 A. 	 	 Time 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	to	Twitter	to	 dispens 	 e 	 	information	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	and	put	a	Twitter	feed	on	the	front	page	,	and	the	 L. 	 A. 	 	Fire	Department	and	Red	Cross	used	it	to	 dispens 	 e 	 	news	and	 update 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
At	 th 	 is 	 	event	,	 dozen 	 s 	 	of	people	are	 Twitter 	 ing 	 	and	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	are	 follow 	 ing 	 	 a 	 long 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	want	to	know	what	it	 feel 	 s 	 	like	to	be	here	and	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
Among	the	other	 interest 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	have	 crop 	 ped 	 	up	are	 man 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	from	 business 	 es 	 	,	from	 market 	 ing 	 	and	 communication 	 s 	 	and	 predict 	 able 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	to	an	 insan 	 e 	 ly 	 	popular	 Korean 	 - 	 barbecue 	 	 ta 	 co 	 	truck	that	 drive 	 s 	 	around	 L. 	 A. 	 	and	 Twitter 	 s 	 	where	it	 stop 	 s 	 	,	 caus 	 ing 	 	a	line	to	form	around	the	block	.
 Poli 	 tic 	 ians 	 	have	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 beg 	 un 	 	 Twitter 	 ing 	 	.
In	fact	,	there	are	47	 member 	 s 	 	of	Congress	who	 current 	 ly 	 	have	Twitter	 account 	 s 	 	.
And	they	're	 tweet 	 ing 	 	,	in	some	 case 	 s 	 	,	from	 be 	 hind 	 	 closed 	 - 	 door 	 	 session 	 s 	 	with	the	 P 	 resident 	 	.
In	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	 th 	 is 	 	guy	's	not	 lik 	 ing 	 	what	he	's	 hear 	 ing 	 	.
The	 P 	 resident 	 	 him 	 self 	 	is	our	most	popular	Twitter	user	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	his	 tweet 	 s 	 	have	 drop 	 ped 	 	off	 a 	 s 	 	of	late	,	while	 Sen 	 ator 	 	 McC 	 ain 	 	's	have	 pick 	 ed 	 	up	.
 A 	 s 	 	have	 th 	 is 	 	guy	's	.
Twitter	was	 original 	 ly 	 	designed	 a 	 s 	 	a	 broad 	 cast 	 	medium	:	you	 s 	 end 	 	one	 mess 	 age 	 	and	it	 go 	 es 	 	out	to	 every 	 body 	 	,	and	you	 receiv 	 e 	 	the	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	you	're	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	.
One	of	the	 man 	 y 	 	ways	that	 user 	 s 	 	shaped	the	evolution	of	Twitter	was	by	 invent 	 ing 	 	a	way	to	 re 	 ply 	 	to	a	specific	person	or	a	specific	 mess 	 age 	 	.
So	,	 th 	 is 	 	 syn 	 tax 	 	,	the	``	@	 user 	 name 	 	''	that	 Sha 	 qu 	 ille 	 	 O' 	 Ne 	 al 	 	's	using	here	to	 re 	 ply 	 	to	one	of	his	 fan 	 s 	 	,	was	 complete 	 ly 	 	 invent 	 ed 	 	by	 user 	 s 	 	,	and	we	did	n't	build	it	 in 	 to 	 	the	system	 un 	 til 	 	it	 al 	 ready 	 	 be 	 came 	 	popular	and	then	we	made	it	 eas 	 ier 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	 man 	 y 	 	ways	that	 user 	 s 	 	have	shaped	the	system	.
 An 	 other 	 	is	via	the	 A 	 PI 	 	.
We	built	an	 application 	 - 	 programm 	 ing 	 	 inter 	 face 	 	,	which	 bas 	 ically 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	that	 programm 	 ers 	 	can	write	 soft 	 ware 	 	that	 interact 	 s 	 	with	Twitter	.
We	 current 	 ly 	 	know	about	over	2,000	 piece 	 s 	 	of	 soft 	 ware 	 	that	can	 s 	 end 	 	Twitter	 update 	 s 	 	--	 inter 	 face 	 s 	 	for	Mac	,	 Wind 	 ow 	 s 	 	,	your	 i 	 Phone 	 	,	your	 Black 	 Ber 	 ry 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	a	 de 	 vice 	 	that	lets	an	 un 	 born 	 	baby	Twitter	when	it	 kick 	 s 	 	or	a	plant	Twitter	when	it	 need 	 s 	 	water	.
 Prob 	 ably 	 	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 third 	 - 	 party 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	came	from	a	little	company	in	 Virgin 	 ia 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 Summ 	 ize 	 	.
 Summ 	 ize 	 	built	a	Twitter	search	engine	.
And	they	 ta 	 pped 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	fact	that	,	if	you	have	 million 	 s 	 	of	people	around	the	world	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	what	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	and	what	's	around	them	,	you	have	an	 in 	 credible 	 	resource	to	find	out	about	any	 top 	 ic 	 	or	event	while	it	's	going	on	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 change 	 d 	 	how	we	 perceive 	 d 	 	Twitter	.
For	 in 	 stance 	 	,	here	's	what	people	are	 say 	 ing 	 	about	TED	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	way	that	our	mind	was	 shift 	 ed 	 	,	and	Twitter	was	n't	what	we	thought	it	was	.
We	 like 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	so	much	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	 b 	 ought 	 	the	company	and	are	 fold 	 ing 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	the	main	product	.
 Th 	 is 	 	not	 on 	 ly 	 	lets	you	view	 Twitter 	 s 	 	in	different	ways	,	but	it	 introduc 	 es 	 	new	use	 case 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
One	of	my	 favor 	 ites 	 	is	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	ago	when	there	was	a	gas	 short 	 age 	 	in	Atlanta	.
Some	 user 	 s 	 	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	that	they	would	Twitter	when	they	found	gas	--	where	it	was	,	and	how	much	it	cost	--	and	then	 append 	 ed 	 	the	 key 	 word 	 	``	#	 atl 	 gas 	 	''	so	that	other	people	search	for	that	and	find	gas	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	trend	of	people	using	 th 	 is 	 	communication	network	to	help	each	other	out	 go 	 es 	 	far	beyond	the	original	idea	of	just	 keep 	 ing 	 	up	with	family	and	 friend 	 s 	 	.
It	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	more	and	more	 late 	 ly 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	raising	money	for	 home 	 less 	 	people	or	to	dig	 well 	 s 	 	in	 Afri 	 ca 	 	or	for	a	family	in	crisis	.
People	have	raised	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	over	Twitter	in	a	matter	of	 day 	 s 	 	on	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 occasion 	 s 	 	.
It	 seem 	 s 	 	like	when	you	give	people	 eas 	 ier 	 	ways	to	share	information	,	more	good	 thing 	 s 	 	happen	.
I	have	no	idea	what	will	happen	next	with	Twitter	.
I	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	to	follow	the	hunch	,	but	never	 assum 	 e 	 	where	it	will	go	.
 Thank 	 s 	 	.
Chris	 And 	 er 	 son 	 	:	We	're	not	 quit 	 e 	 	 d 	 one 	 	yet	.
So	,	look	,	if	we	could	have	 th 	 is 	 	screen	live	...
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	most	 terrify 	 ing 	 	thing	that	any	speaker	can	do	after	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	to	an	event	.
It	's	 total 	 ly 	 	 intimid 	 ating 	 	.
So	,	 th 	 is 	 	would	be	the	Twitter	search	screen	.
Let	's	type	a	couple	of	random	 word 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	Twitter	.
For	 ex 	 ample 	 	:	``	 E 	 van 	 	 William 	 s 	 	.	''
``	...	give	people	more	information	and	follow	your	hunch	@	#	TED	.	''
``	...	 current 	 ly 	 	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	 E 	 van 	 	 William 	 s 	 	.	''
Oh	...
``	 E 	 van 	 	 William 	 s 	 	is	just	 dy 	 ing 	 	on	stage	here	at	TED	.
Worst	talk	ever	!	''
 E 	 van 	 	 William 	 s 	 	:	 Nic 	 e 	 	.	 Thank 	 s 	 	.
CA	:	Just	 kid 	 d 	 ing 	 	.
But	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	in	the	eight	 minute 	 s 	 	he	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	,	there	are	about	fifty	 tweet 	 s 	 	that	 al 	 ready 	 	came	on	the	talk	.
So	he	'll	see	every	 a 	 spect 	 	of	the	 re 	 action 	 	:	the	fact	that	 Bar 	 ack 	 	Obama	is	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 Twitter 	 er 	 	,	the	fact	that	it	came	out	of	TED	...
I	do	n't	think	there	's	any	other	way	of	 get 	 ting 	 	instant	 feed 	 back 	 	that	way	.
You	have	build	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 fasci 	 nating 	 	,	and	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	 it 	 s 	 	best	 time 	 s 	 	are	still	 a 	 head 	 	of	it	.
So	,	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	,	 E 	 van 	 	.
That	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.	 E 	 W 	 	:	Thank	you	.
I	'm	a	 story 	 teller 	 	.
And	I	would	like	to	tell	you	a	few	personal	 st 	 ories 	 	about	what	I	like	to	call	``	the	danger	of	the	single	story	.	''
I	grew	up	on	a	university	campus	in	eastern	 Niger 	 ia 	 	.
My	mother	 say 	 s 	 	that	I	 start 	 ed 	 	 read 	 ing 	 	at	the	age	of	two	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	I	think	four	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	close	to	the	truth	.
So	I	was	an	early	 read 	 er 	 	,	and	what	I	read	 we 	 re 	 	 Brit 	 ish 	 	and	American	children	's	 book 	 s 	 	.
I	was	 al 	 so 	 	an	early	writer	,	and	when	I	 beg 	 an 	 	to	write	,	at	about	the	age	of	seven	,	 st 	 ories 	 	in	pencil	with	 cray 	 on 	 	 illustr 	 ations 	 	that	my	poor	mother	was	 oblig 	 ated 	 	to	read	,	I	wrote	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 st 	 ories 	 	I	was	 read 	 ing 	 	:	All	my	 character 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	white	and	 blue 	 - 	 eyed 	 	,	they	 play 	 ed 	 	in	the	snow	,	they	ate	 apple 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 talk 	 ed 	 	a	lot	about	the	weather	,	how	 love 	 ly 	 	it	was	that	the	 s 	 un 	 	had	come	out	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 de 	 spite 	 	the	fact	that	I	lived	in	 Niger 	 ia 	 	.
I	had	never	 be 	 en 	 	 out 	 side 	 	 Niger 	 ia 	 	.
We	did	n't	have	snow	,	we	ate	 man 	 go 	 es 	 	,	and	we	never	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	the	weather	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	was	no	need	to	.
My	 character 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 d 	 rank 	 	a	lot	of	 ging 	 er 	 	beer	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 character 	 s 	 	in	the	 Brit 	 ish 	 	 book 	 s 	 	I	read	 d 	 rank 	 	 ging 	 er 	 	beer	.
Never	mind	that	I	had	no	idea	what	 ging 	 er 	 	beer	was	.
And	for	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	,	I	would	have	a	desperate	 desir 	 e 	 	to	taste	 ging 	 er 	 	beer	.
But	that	is	 an 	 other 	 	story	.
What	 th 	 is 	 	 demonst 	 rates 	 	,	I	think	,	is	how	 impression 	 able 	 	and	 vulner 	 able 	 	we	are	in	the	face	of	a	story	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	children	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	all	I	had	read	 we 	 re 	 	 book 	 s 	 	in	which	 character 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	foreign	,	I	had	 be 	 come 	 	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	that	 book 	 s 	 	by	 the 	 ir 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	nature	had	to	have	 foreign 	 ers 	 	in	them	and	had	to	be	about	 thing 	 s 	 	with	which	I	could	not	 personal 	 ly 	 	identify	.
 Th 	 ing 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	when	I	 discover 	 ed 	 	African	 book 	 s 	 	.
There	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 man 	 y 	 	of	them	 avail 	 able 	 	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	 a 	 s 	 	easy	to	find	 a 	 s 	 	the	foreign	 book 	 s 	 	.
But	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 writer 	 s 	 	like	 Chi 	 nua 	 	Achebe	and	Camara	 Lay 	 e 	 	I	went	through	a	mental	shift	in	my	 per 	 ception 	 	of	 liter 	 ature 	 	.
I	 real 	 ized 	 	that	people	like	me	,	 girl 	 s 	 	with	skin	the	color	of	chocolate	,	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	 kin 	 ky 	 	hair	could	not	form	 ponytail 	 s 	 	,	could	 al 	 so 	 	exist	in	 liter 	 ature 	 	.
I	 start 	 ed 	 	to	write	about	 thing 	 s 	 	I	 recogn 	 ized 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	I	 love 	 d 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	American	and	 Brit 	 ish 	 	 book 	 s 	 	I	read	.
 The 	 y 	 	 stir 	 red 	 	my	 imagin 	 ation 	 	.	 The 	 y 	 	 open 	 ed 	 	up	new	 world 	 s 	 	for	me	.
But	the	 un 	 intend 	 ed 	 	 con 	 sequence 	 	was	that	I	did	not	know	that	people	like	me	could	exist	in	 liter 	 ature 	 	.
So	what	the	 discover 	 y 	 	of	African	 writer 	 s 	 	did	for	me	was	 th 	 is 	 	:	It	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	me	from	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	single	story	of	what	 book 	 s 	 	are	.
I	come	from	a	 convention 	 al 	 	,	 middle 	 - 	 class 	 	 Niger 	 ian 	 	family	.
My	father	was	a	professor	.
My	mother	was	an	 administr 	 ator 	 	.
And	so	we	had	,	 a 	 s 	 	was	the	norm	,	 live 	 - 	 in 	 	domestic	help	,	who	would	often	come	from	 near 	 by 	 	 r 	 ural 	 	 village 	 s 	 	.
So	the	year	I	 turn 	 ed 	 	eight	we	got	a	new	house	boy	.
 Hi 	 s 	 	name	was	 Fi 	 de 	 	.
The	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	my	mother	told	us	about	him	was	that	his	family	was	 ver 	 y 	 	poor	.
My	mother	 s 	 ent 	 	 y 	 am 	 s 	 	and	rice	,	and	our	old	 clothe 	 s 	 	,	to	his	family	.
And	when	I	did	n't	finish	my	 d 	 inner 	 	my	mother	would	say	,	``	Finish	your	food	!	Do	n't	you	know	?	People	like	 Fi 	 de 	 	's	family	have	 noth 	 ing 	 	.	''
So	I	felt	enormous	 p 	 ity 	 	for	 Fi 	 de 	 	's	family	.
 Th 	 en 	 	one	Saturday	we	went	to	his	village	to	visit	,	and	his	mother	 show 	 ed 	 	us	a	 beaut 	 i 	 fully 	 	 pattern 	 ed 	 	basket	made	of	 dy 	 ed 	 	raffia	that	his	brother	had	made	.
I	was	 start 	 led 	 	.
It	had	not	 occur 	 red 	 	to	me	that	 any 	 body 	 	in	his	family	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	make	 some 	 thing 	 	.
All	I	had	heard	about	them	was	how	poor	they	 we 	 re 	 	,	so	that	it	had	 be 	 come 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	for	me	to	see	them	 a 	 s 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	else	but	poor	.
 T 	 heir 	 	poverty	was	my	single	story	of	them	.
 Year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	I	thought	about	 th 	 is 	 	when	I	left	 Niger 	 ia 	 	to	go	to	university	in	the	 Unit 	 ed 	 	 Stat 	 es 	 	.
I	was	19	.
My	American	 room 	 mate 	 	was	 shock 	 ed 	 	by	me	.
She	 ask 	 ed 	 	where	I	had	 learn 	 ed 	 	to	speak	English	so	well	,	and	was	 con 	 fused 	 	when	I	 s 	 aid 	 	that	 Niger 	 ia 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	have	English	 a 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	official	language	.
She	 ask 	 ed 	 	if	she	could	listen	to	what	she	 call 	 ed 	 	my	``	 trib 	 al 	 	music	,	''	and	was	 con 	 sequent 	 ly 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 disappoint 	 ed 	 	when	I	 produce 	 d 	 	my	tape	of	 Mar 	 iah 	 	 Care 	 y 	 	.
She	 assum 	 ed 	 	that	I	did	not	know	how	to	use	a	stove	.
What	 s 	 truck 	 	me	was	 th 	 is 	 	:	She	had	felt	sorry	for	me	even	before	she	saw	me	.
Her	default	position	 to 	 ward 	 	me	,	 a 	 s 	 	an	African	,	was	a	kind	of	 patron 	 izing 	 	,	 well 	 - 	 meaning 	 	 p 	 ity 	 	.
My	 room 	 mate 	 	had	a	single	story	of	 Afri 	 ca 	 	:	a	single	story	of	 catastroph 	 e 	 	.
In	 th 	 is 	 	single	story	there	was	no	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	 African 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	similar	to	her	in	any	way	,	no	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	more	complex	than	 p 	 ity 	 	,	no	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	a	 connect 	 ion 	 	 a 	 s 	 	human	 equal 	 s 	 	.
I	must	say	that	before	I	went	to	the	 U. 	 S 	 	.	I	did	n't	 conscious 	 ly 	 	identify	 a 	 s 	 	African	.
But	in	the	U.S.	 when 	 ever 	 	 Afri 	 ca 	 	came	up	people	 turn 	 ed 	 	to	me	.
Never	mind	that	I	 k 	 new 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	about	 place 	 s 	 	like	Namibia	.
But	I	did	come	to	embrace	 th 	 is 	 	new	 ident 	 ity 	 	,	and	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	I	think	of	 my 	 self 	 	now	 a 	 s 	 	African	.
 Al 	 th 	 ough 	 	I	still	get	 quit 	 e 	 	 irrit 	 able 	 	when	 Afri 	 ca 	 	is	 refer 	 red 	 	to	 a 	 s 	 	a	country	,	the	most	 re 	 cent 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	my	 other 	 wise 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	flight	from	 La 	 go 	 s 	 	two	 day 	 s 	 	ago	,	in	which	there	was	an	 announce 	 ment 	 	on	the	Virgin	flight	about	the	 char 	 ity 	 	work	in	``	India	,	 Afri 	 ca 	 	and	other	 count 	 ries 	 	.

So	after	I	had	 s 	 pent 	 	some	 year 	 s 	 	in	the	U.S.	 a 	 s 	 	an	African	,	I	 beg 	 an 	 	to	understand	my	 room 	 mate 	 	's	 respons 	 e 	 	to	me	.
If	I	had	not	grown	up	in	 Niger 	 ia 	 	,	and	if	all	I	 k 	 new 	 	about	 Afri 	 ca 	 	 we 	 re 	 	from	popular	 image 	 s 	 	,	I	too	would	think	that	 Afri 	 ca 	 	was	a	place	of	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 land 	 scapes 	 	,	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	,	and	 in 	 comprehens 	 ible 	 	people	,	 fight 	 ing 	 	 sense 	 less 	 	 war 	 s 	 	,	 dy 	 ing 	 	of	poverty	and	AIDS	,	 un 	 able 	 	to	speak	for	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	and	 wait 	 ing 	 	to	be	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	by	a	kind	,	white	 foreign 	 er 	 	.
I	would	see	 African 	 s 	 	in	the	same	way	that	I	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	child	,	had	 s 	 een 	 	 Fi 	 de 	 	's	family	.
 Th 	 is 	 	single	story	of	 Afri 	 ca 	 	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	 come 	 s 	 	,	I	think	,	from	Western	 liter 	 ature 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	here	is	a	quote	from	the	writing	of	a	London	 merchan 	 t 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	John	 Lock 	 e 	 	,	who	 s 	 ailed 	 	to	west	 Afri 	 ca 	 	in	1561	and	 ke 	 pt 	 	a	 fasci 	 nating 	 	account	of	his	voyage	.
After	 refer 	 ring 	 	to	the	black	 African 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	``	 beast 	 s 	 	who	have	no	 house 	 s 	 	,	''	he	 write 	 s 	 	,	``	 The 	 y 	 	are	 al 	 so 	 	people	 with 	 out 	 	 head 	 s 	 	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	mouth	and	 eye 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 breast 	 s 	 	.	''
 N 	 ow 	 	,	I	've	 laugh 	 ed 	 	every	time	I	've	read	 th 	 is 	 	.
And	one	must	admire	the	 imagin 	 ation 	 	of	John	 Lock 	 e 	 	.
But	what	is	 import 	 ant 	 	about	his	writing	is	that	it	 represent 	 s 	 	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	a	tradition	of	 tell 	 ing 	 	African	 st 	 ories 	 	in	the	West	:	A	tradition	of	 Sub 	 - 	 Saharan 	 	 Afri 	 ca 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	place	of	 negative 	 s 	 	,	of	 differ 	 ence 	 	,	of	 dark 	 ness 	 	,	of	people	who	,	in	the	 word 	 s 	 	of	the	 wonder 	 ful 	 	poet	Rudyard	Kipling	,	are	``	half	devil	,	half	child	.	''
And	so	I	 beg 	 an 	 	to	 real 	 ize 	 	that	my	American	 room 	 mate 	 	must	have	 through 	 out 	 	her	life	 s 	 een 	 	and	heard	different	 version 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	single	story	,	 a 	 s 	 	had	a	professor	,	who	once	told	me	that	my	novel	was	not	``	 authentic 	 ally 	 	African	.	''
 N 	 ow 	 	,	I	was	 quit 	 e 	 	 will 	 ing 	 	to	 con 	 tend 	 	that	there	 we 	 re 	 	a	number	of	 thing 	 s 	 	wrong	with	the	novel	,	that	it	had	 fail 	 ed 	 	in	a	number	of	 place 	 s 	 	,	but	I	had	not	 quit 	 e 	 	 imagin 	 ed 	 	that	it	had	 fail 	 ed 	 	at	 achiev 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	African	 authentic 	 ity 	 	.
In	fact	I	did	not	know	what	African	 authentic 	 ity 	 	was	.
The	professor	told	me	that	my	 character 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	too	much	like	him	,	an	educated	and	 middle 	 - 	 class 	 	man	.
My	 character 	 s 	 	drove	 car 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	 we 	 re 	 	not	 starv 	 ing 	 	.
 There 	 fore 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	not	 authentic 	 ally 	 	African	.
But	I	must	 quick 	 ly 	 	add	that	I	too	am	just	 a 	 s 	 	 guilt 	 y 	 	in	the	question	of	the	single	story	.
A	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	I	 visit 	 ed 	 	Mexico	from	the	 U. 	 S 	 	.
The	 politic 	 al 	 	climate	in	the	U.S.	at	the	time	was	tense	,	and	there	 we 	 re 	 	 debate 	 s 	 	going	on	about	 im 	 migr 	 ation 	 	.
And	,	 a 	 s 	 	often	 happen 	 s 	 	in	America	,	 im 	 migr 	 ation 	 	 be 	 came 	 	synonymous	with	 Mexican 	 s 	 	.
There	 we 	 re 	 	 end 	 less 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	of	 Mexican 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	 flee 	 c 	 ing 	 	the	 health 	 care 	 	system	,	 sneak 	 ing 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	border	,	 be 	 ing 	 	 arrest 	 ed 	 	at	the	border	,	that	sort	of	thing	.
I	remember	 walk 	 ing 	 	around	on	my	first	day	in	 Gua 	 dalajara 	 	,	 watch 	 ing 	 	the	people	going	to	work	,	 roll 	 ing 	 	up	 tort 	 illa 	 s 	 	in	the	 market 	 place 	 	,	 smok 	 ing 	 	,	 laugh 	 ing 	 	.
I	remember	first	 feel 	 ing 	 	 s 	 light 	 	surprise	.
And	then	I	was	 overwhelm 	 ed 	 	with	shame	.
I	 real 	 ized 	 	that	I	had	 be 	 en 	 	so	 immers 	 ed 	 	in	the	media	 cover 	 age 	 	of	 Mexican 	 s 	 	that	they	had	 be 	 come 	 	one	thing	in	my	mind	,	the	 ab 	 ject 	 	 im 	 migrant 	 	.
I	had	 b 	 ought 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	single	story	of	 Mexican 	 s 	 	and	I	could	not	have	 be 	 en 	 	more	 a 	 shame 	 d 	 	of	 my 	 self 	 	.
So	that	is	how	to	create	a	single	story	,	show	a	people	 a 	 s 	 	one	thing	,	 a 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	one	thing	,	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	,	and	that	is	what	they	 be 	 come 	 	.
It	is	 im 	 possible 	 	to	talk	about	the	single	story	 with 	 out 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	power	.
There	is	a	word	,	an	Igbo	word	,	that	I	think	about	 when 	 ever 	 	I	think	about	the	power	 structure 	 s 	 	of	the	world	,	and	it	is	``	 nk 	 ali 	 	.	''
It	's	a	 no 	 un 	 	that	 loose 	 ly 	 	 transl 	 ates 	 	to	``	to	be	 great 	 er 	 	than	 an 	 other 	 	.	''
Like	our	economic	and	 politic 	 al 	 	 world 	 s 	 	,	 st 	 ories 	 	too	are	defined	by	the	principle	of	 nk 	 ali 	 	:	How	they	are	told	,	who	 tell 	 s 	 	them	,	when	they	're	told	,	how	 man 	 y 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	are	told	,	are	 re 	 ally 	 	dependent	on	power	.
Power	is	the	ability	not	just	to	tell	the	story	of	 an 	 other 	 	person	,	but	to	make	it	the	definitive	story	of	that	person	.
The	Palestinian	poet	 Mo 	 u 	 rid 	 	 Bar 	 ghouti 	 	 write 	 s 	 	that	if	you	want	to	 dis 	 possess 	 	a	people	,	the	 simpl 	 est 	 	way	to	do	it	is	to	tell	 the 	 ir 	 	story	and	to	start	with	,	``	 second 	 ly 	 	.	''
Start	the	story	with	the	 arrow 	 s 	 	of	the	 N 	 ative 	 	 American 	 s 	 	,	and	not	with	the	 arriv 	 al 	 	of	the	 Brit 	 ish 	 	,	and	you	have	an	 entire 	 ly 	 	different	story	.
Start	the	story	with	the	failure	of	the	African	state	,	and	not	with	the	colonial	creation	of	the	African	state	,	and	you	have	an	 entire 	 ly 	 	different	story	.
I	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	spoke	at	a	university	where	a	student	told	me	that	it	was	 s 	 uch 	 	a	shame	that	 Niger 	 ian 	 	men	 we 	 re 	 	physical	 abuse 	 rs 	 	like	the	father	character	in	my	novel	.
I	told	him	that	I	had	just	read	a	novel	 call 	 ed 	 	American	Psycho	--	--	and	that	it	was	 s 	 uch 	 	a	shame	that	young	 American 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 erial 	 	 murder 	 ers 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	I	 s 	 aid 	 	 th 	 is 	 	in	a	fit	of	mild	 irrit 	 ation 	 	.
But	it	would	never	have	 occur 	 red 	 	to	me	to	think	that	just	 be 	 cause 	 	I	had	read	a	novel	in	which	a	character	was	a	 s 	 erial 	 	killer	that	he	was	 some 	 how 	 	 represent 	 ative 	 	of	all	 American 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	not	 be 	 cause 	 	I	am	a	better	person	than	that	student	,	but	 be 	 cause 	 	of	America	's	cultural	and	economic	power	,	I	had	 man 	 y 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	of	America	.
I	had	read	 Ty 	 ler 	 	and	 Up 	 dike 	 	and	 Stein 	 beck 	 	and	 Ga 	 it 	 skill 	 	.
I	did	not	have	a	single	story	of	America	.
When	I	 learn 	 ed 	 	,	some	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	that	 writer 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 expect 	 ed 	 	to	have	had	 re 	 ally 	 	 un 	 happy 	 	 child 	 hood 	 s 	 	to	be	 success 	 ful 	 	,	I	 beg 	 an 	 	to	think	about	how	I	could	invent	 horr 	 ible 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	my	 parent 	 s 	 	had	 d 	 one 	 	to	me	.
But	the	truth	is	that	I	had	a	 ver 	 y 	 	happy	 child 	 hood 	 	,	full	of	laughter	and	love	,	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 close 	 - 	 knit 	 	family	.
But	I	 al 	 so 	 	had	 grand 	 father 	 s 	 	who	 di 	 ed 	 	in	 refuge 	 e 	 	 camp 	 s 	 	.
My	cousin	 Poll 	 e 	 	 di 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	he	could	not	get	 ad 	 equate 	 	 health 	 care 	 	.
One	of	my	 close 	 st 	 	 friend 	 s 	 	,	Okoloma	,	 di 	 ed 	 	in	a	plane	crash	 be 	 cause 	 	our	fire	 truck 	 s 	 	did	not	have	water	.
I	grew	up	under	 repress 	 ive 	 	 militar 	 y 	 	 government 	 s 	 	that	 d 	 evalu 	 ed 	 	education	,	so	that	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	my	 parent 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	not	paid	 the 	 ir 	 	 s 	 al 	 aries 	 	.
And	so	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	child	,	I	saw	jam	disappear	from	the	 break 	 fast 	 	table	,	then	 mar 	 gar 	 ine 	 	 disappear 	 ed 	 	,	then	bread	 be 	 came 	 	too	expensive	,	then	milk	 be 	 came 	 	 ration 	 ed 	 	.
And	most	of	all	,	a	kind	of	 normal 	 ized 	 	 politic 	 al 	 	fear	 invad 	 ed 	 	our	 live 	 s 	 	.
All	of	these	 st 	 ories 	 	make	me	who	I	am	.
But	to	insist	on	 on 	 ly 	 	these	negative	 st 	 ories 	 	is	to	flatten	my	experience	and	to	overlook	the	 man 	 y 	 	other	 st 	 ories 	 	that	 form 	 ed 	 	me	.
The	single	story	 create 	 s 	 	 stereo 	 type 	 s 	 	,	and	the	problem	with	 stereo 	 type 	 s 	 	is	not	that	they	are	 un 	 true 	 	,	but	that	they	are	 in 	 complete 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	make	one	story	 be 	 come 	 	the	 on 	 ly 	 	story	.
Of	course	,	 Afri 	 ca 	 	is	a	continent	full	of	 catastroph 	 es 	 	:	There	are	immense	 one 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 horr 	 ific 	 	 rape 	 s 	 	in	 Con 	 go 	 	and	 depress 	 ing 	 	 one 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	fact	that	5,000	people	 app 	 ly 	 	for	one	job	 vac 	 ancy 	 	in	 Niger 	 ia 	 	.
But	there	are	other	 st 	 ories 	 	that	are	not	about	 catastroph 	 e 	 	,	and	it	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	it	is	just	 a 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	to	talk	about	them	.
I	've	 al 	 ways 	 	felt	that	it	is	 im 	 possible 	 	to	engage	 proper 	 ly 	 	with	a	place	or	a	person	 with 	 out 	 	 engag 	 ing 	 	with	all	of	the	 st 	 ories 	 	of	that	place	and	that	person	.
The	 con 	 sequence 	 	of	the	single	story	is	 th 	 is 	 	:	It	 rob 	 s 	 	people	of	dignity	.
It	 make 	 s 	 	our	 re 	 cognition 	 	of	our	equal	 human 	 ity 	 	difficult	.
It	 emphas 	 ize 	 s 	 	how	we	are	different	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	how	we	are	similar	.
So	what	if	before	my	Mexican	trip	I	had	 follow 	 ed 	 	the	 im 	 migr 	 ation 	 	debate	from	both	 side 	 s 	 	,	the	U.S.	and	the	Mexican	?
What	if	my	mother	had	told	us	that	 Fi 	 de 	 	's	family	was	poor	and	 hard 	 work 	 ing 	 	?
What	if	we	had	an	African	 tele 	 vision 	 	network	that	 broad 	 cast 	 	 divers 	 e 	 	African	 st 	 ories 	 	all	over	the	world	?
What	the	 Niger 	 ian 	 	writer	 Chi 	 nua 	 	Achebe	 call 	 s 	 	``	a	balance	of	 st 	 ories 	 	.	''
What	if	my	 room 	 mate 	 	 k 	 new 	 	about	my	 Niger 	 ian 	 	 publish 	 er 	 	,	Mukta	Bakaray	,	a	 remark 	 able 	 	man	who	left	his	job	in	a	bank	to	follow	his	dream	and	start	a	 publish 	 ing 	 	house	?
 N 	 ow 	 	,	the	 convention 	 al 	 	 wis 	 dom 	 	was	that	 Niger 	 ians 	 	do	n't	read	 liter 	 ature 	 	.
He	 disagree 	 d 	 	.	He	felt	that	people	who	could	read	,	would	read	,	if	you	made	 liter 	 ature 	 	 afford 	 able 	 	and	 avail 	 able 	 	to	them	.
 Short 	 ly 	 	after	he	 publish 	 ed 	 	my	first	novel	I	went	to	a	TV	station	in	 La 	 go 	 s 	 	to	do	an	interview	,	and	a	woman	who	 work 	 ed 	 	there	 a 	 s 	 	a	messenger	came	up	to	me	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	I	 re 	 ally 	 	 like 	 d 	 	your	novel	.	I	did	n't	like	the	 end 	 ing 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	you	must	write	a	 s 	 equ 	 el 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	will	happen	...	''
And	she	went	on	to	tell	me	what	to	write	in	the	 s 	 equ 	 el 	 	.
I	was	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 charm 	 ed 	 	,	I	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 move 	 d 	 	.

We	face	 moment 	 ous 	 	 decision 	 s 	 	with	 import 	 ant 	 	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	 through 	 out 	 	our	 live 	 s 	 	,	and	we	have	 strat 	 egi 	 es 	 	for	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	these	 decision 	 s 	 	.
We	talk	 thing 	 s 	 	over	with	our	 friend 	 s 	 	,	we	scour	the	Internet	,	we	search	through	 book 	 s 	 	.
But	still	,	even	in	 th 	 is 	 	age	of	Google	and	 T 	 rip 	 Ad 	 visor 	 	and	Amazon	 Re 	 commen 	 d 	 s 	 	,	it	's	still	 expert 	 s 	 	that	we	 re 	 ly 	 	 up 	 on 	 	most	--	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	when	the	 s 	 take 	 s 	 	are	high	and	the	decision	 re 	 ally 	 	 matter 	 s 	 	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	in	a	world	of	data	 del 	 uge 	 	and	 extrem 	 e 	 	 complex 	 ity 	 	,	we	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 expert 	 s 	 	are	more	able	to	process	information	than	we	can	--	that	they	are	able	to	come	to	better	 con 	 clusion 	 s 	 	than	we	could	come	to	on	our	own	.
And	in	an	age	that	is	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 now 	 a 	 day 	 s 	 	 frighten 	 ing 	 	or	 con 	 fusing 	 	,	we	feel	 re 	 assur 	 ed 	 	by	the	 al 	 most 	 	 parent 	 al 	 - 	 like 	 	 author 	 ity 	 	of	 expert 	 s 	 	who	tell	us	so	 clear 	 ly 	 	what	it	is	we	can	and	can	not	do	.
But	I	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	big	problem	,	a	problem	with	 potential 	 ly 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	for	us	 a 	 s 	 	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	culture	and	 a 	 s 	 	 individual 	 s 	 	.
It	's	not	that	 expert 	 s 	 	have	not	 massive 	 ly 	 	 con 	 tribute 	 d 	 	to	the	world	--	of	course	they	have	.
The	problem	lies	with	us	:	we	've	 be 	 come 	 	 addict 	 ed 	 	to	 expert 	 s 	 	.
We	've	 be 	 come 	 	 addict 	 ed 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 certain 	 ty 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 assur 	 ed 	 ness 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 definitive 	 ness 	 	,	and	in	the	process	,	we	have	 cede 	 d 	 	our	 respons 	 ibility 	 	,	 substitut 	 ing 	 	our	 in 	 tell 	 ect 	 	and	our	 intellig 	 ence 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 suppose 	 d 	 	 word 	 s 	 	of	 wis 	 dom 	 	.
We	've	 surrender 	 ed 	 	our	power	,	 tra 	 d 	 ing 	 	off	our	 dis 	 comfort 	 	with	 un 	 certain 	 ty 	 	for	the	illusion	of	 certain 	 ty 	 	that	they	provide	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	no	 exagge 	 ration 	 	.
In	a	 re 	 cent 	 	experiment	,	a	group	of	 adult 	 s 	 	had	 the 	 ir 	 	 brain 	 s 	 	 s 	 can 	 ned 	 	in	an	MRI	machine	 a 	 s 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	 expert 	 s 	 	speak	.
The	 result 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	.
 A 	 s 	 	they	 listen 	 ed 	 	to	the	 expert 	 s 	 	'	 voice 	 s 	 	,	the	 in 	 dependent 	 	 decision 	 - 	 making 	 	 part 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 brain 	 s 	 	 s 	 witch 	 ed 	 	off	.
It	 liter 	 ally 	 	 flat 	 - 	 lined 	 	.
And	they	 listen 	 ed 	 	to	 what 	 ever 	 	the	 expert 	 s 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	and	took	 the 	 ir 	 	 ad 	 vice 	 	,	 how 	 ever 	 	right	or	wrong	.
But	 expert 	 s 	 	do	get	 thing 	 s 	 	wrong	.
Did	you	know	that	 stud 	 ies 	 	show	that	 doctor 	 s 	 	 mis 	 diagnos 	 e 	 	four	 time 	 s 	 	out	of	10	?
Did	you	know	that	if	you	file	your	tax	 return 	 s 	 	 your 	 self 	 	,	you	're	 statistic 	 ally 	 	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	be	filing	them	 correct 	 ly 	 	than	if	you	get	a	tax	 advise 	 r 	 	to	do	it	for	you	?
And	then	there	's	,	of	course	,	the	 ex 	 ample 	 	that	we	're	all	too	aware	of	:	financial	 expert 	 s 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	it	so	wrong	that	we	're	living	through	the	worst	 recess 	 ion 	 	since	the	1930s	.
For	the	sake	of	our	health	,	and	our	 collect 	 ive 	 	security	,	it	's	 imper 	 ative 	 	that	we	keep	the	 in 	 dependent 	 	 decision 	 - 	 making 	 	 part 	 s 	 	of	our	 brain 	 s 	 	 s 	 witch 	 ed 	 	on	.
And	I	'm	 say 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	economist	who	,	over	the	past	few	 year 	 s 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	focused	my	research	on	what	it	is	we	think	and	who	it	is	we	trust	and	why	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	--	and	I	'm	aware	of	the	 iron 	 y 	 	here	--	 a 	 s 	 	an	expert	 my 	 self 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	professor	,	 a 	 s 	 	 some 	 body 	 	who	 advise 	 s 	 	prime	 mini 	 sters 	 	,	 head 	 s 	 	of	big	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	,	 inter 	 national 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	,	but	an	expert	who	 believ 	 es 	 	that	the	role	of	 expert 	 s 	 	 need 	 s 	 	to	change	,	that	we	need	to	 be 	 come 	 	more	 open 	 - 	 minded 	 	,	more	 democrat 	 ic 	 	and	be	more	open	to	people	 rebel 	 ling 	 	against	our	 point 	 s 	 	of	view	.
So	in	order	to	help	you	understand	where	I	'm	coming	from	,	let	me	 br 	 ing 	 	you	 in 	 to 	 	my	world	,	the	world	of	 expert 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	there	are	,	of	course	,	 exception 	 s 	 	,	 wonder 	 ful 	 	,	 civil 	 ization 	 - 	 enhancing 	 	 exception 	 s 	 	.
But	what	my	research	 ha 	 s 	 	 show 	 n 	 	me	is	that	 expert 	 s 	 	tend	on	the	whole	to	form	 ver 	 y 	 	rigid	 camp 	 s 	 	,	that	 with 	 in 	 	these	 camp 	 s 	 	,	a	 domin 	 ant 	 	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	 emerge 	 s 	 	that	often	 silence 	 s 	 	 op 	 position 	 	,	that	 expert 	 s 	 	move	with	the	 prevail 	 ing 	 	 wind 	 s 	 	,	often	 hero 	 - 	 worship 	 ping 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 guru 	 s 	 	.

You	see	,	we	 al 	 so 	 	learn	that	 expert 	 s 	 	are	 locate 	 d 	 	,	are	 govern 	 ed 	 	,	by	the	social	and	cultural	 norm 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 time 	 s 	 	--	 whet 	 her 	 	it	be	the	 doctor 	 s 	 	in	 Victoria 	 n 	 	 Eng 	 land 	 	,	say	,	who	 s 	 ent 	 	women	to	 asylum 	 s 	 	for	 express 	 ing 	 	sexual	 desir 	 e 	 	,	or	the	 psychiatrist 	 s 	 	in	the	 Unit 	 ed 	 	 Stat 	 es 	 	who	,	up	 un 	 til 	 	1973	,	 we 	 re 	 	still	 categor 	 izing 	 	 homo 	 sexual 	 ity 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	mental	 ill 	 ness 	 	.
And	what	all	 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	is	that	 paradigm 	 s 	 	take	far	too	long	to	shift	,	that	 complex 	 ity 	 	and	nuance	are	 ignor 	 ed 	 	and	 al 	 so 	 	that	money	 talk 	 s 	 	--	 be 	 cause 	 	we	've	all	 s 	 een 	 	the	evidence	of	pharmaceutical	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	 fund 	 ing 	 	 stud 	 ies 	 	of	 drug 	 s 	 	that	 convenient 	 ly 	 	 leav 	 e 	 	out	 the 	 ir 	 	worst	side	 effect 	 s 	 	,	or	 stud 	 ies 	 	funded	by	food	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	new	 product 	 s 	 	,	 massive 	 ly 	 	 exagge 	 rating 	 	the	health	 benefit 	 s 	 	of	the	 product 	 s 	 	they	're	about	to	 br 	 ing 	 	by	market	.

And	we	've	 al 	 so 	 	got	to	be	aware	that	 expert 	 s 	 	,	of	course	,	 al 	 so 	 	make	 mistak 	 es 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	make	 mistak 	 es 	 	every	single	day	--	 mistak 	 es 	 	born	out	of	 care 	 lessness 	 	.

A	common	 think 	 ing 	 	error	of	 radio 	 logists 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	--	when	they	look	at	 C 	 T 	 	 s 	 can 	 s 	 	--	is	that	they	're	 over 	 ly 	 	 influence 	 d 	 	by	 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	that	the	 refer 	 ring 	 	physician	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	that	he	 suspect 	 s 	 	the	patient	's	problem	to	be	.

I	've	 share 	 d 	 	with	you	so	far	some	 in 	 sight 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	world	of	 expert 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	,	of	course	,	not	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 in 	 sight 	 s 	 	I	could	share	,	but	I	hope	they	give	you	a	clear	sense	at	 l 	 east 	 	of	why	we	need	to	stop	 kow 	 tow 	 ing 	 	to	them	,	why	we	need	to	rebel	and	why	we	need	to	 s 	 witch 	 	our	 in 	 dependent 	 	 decision 	 - 	 making 	 	 cap 	 abilities 	 	on	.
But	how	can	we	do	 th 	 is 	 	?
Well	for	the	sake	of	time	,	I	want	to	focus	on	just	three	 strat 	 egi 	 es 	 	.
First	,	we	've	got	to	be	ready	and	 will 	 ing 	 	to	take	 expert 	 s 	 	on	and	 dispens 	 e 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	of	them	 a 	 s 	 	 modern 	 - 	 day 	 	 a 	 post 	 les 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	get	a	Ph.D	.
in	every	single	subject	,	you	'll	be	 reliev 	 ed 	 	to	hear	.
But	it	 do 	 es 	 	mean	 persist 	 ing 	 	in	the	face	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 inevit 	 able 	 	 annoy 	 ance 	 	when	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	we	want	them	to	explain	 thing 	 s 	 	to	us	in	language	that	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	understand	.
Why	was	it	that	,	when	I	had	an	operation	,	my	doctor	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	,	``	 Be 	 ware 	 	,	 M 	 s 	 . 	 	 Her 	 tz 	 	,	of	 hyper 	 py 	 re 	 xia 	 	,	''	when	he	could	have	just	 a 	 s 	 	 eas 	 ily 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 Wat 	 ch 	 	out	for	a	high	 f 	 ever 	 	.	''
You	see	,	 be 	 ing 	 	ready	to	take	 expert 	 s 	 	on	is	about	 al 	 so 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 will 	 ing 	 	to	dig	 be 	 hind 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 graph 	 s 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 equ 	 ations 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 fore 	 cast 	 s 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 prop 	 he 	 cies 	 	,	and	 be 	 ing 	 	 arm 	 ed 	 	with	the	 question 	 s 	 	to	do	that	--	 question 	 s 	 	like	:	What	are	the	 assumption 	 s 	 	that	 under 	 pin 	 	 th 	 is 	 	?
What	is	the	evidence	 up 	 on 	 	which	 th 	 is 	 	is	based	?
What	 ha 	 s 	 	your	investigation	focused	on	?
And	what	 ha 	 s 	 	it	 ignor 	 ed 	 	?
It	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	came	out	that	 expert 	 s 	 	 trial 	 ing 	 	 drug 	 s 	 	before	they	come	to	market	 typical 	 ly 	 	trial	 drug 	 s 	 	first	,	 prim 	 arily 	 	on	male	 animal 	 s 	 	and	then	,	 prim 	 arily 	 	on	men	.
It	 seem 	 s 	 	that	they	've	 some 	 how 	 	 overlook 	 ed 	 	the	fact	that	over	half	the	world	's	population	are	women	.
And	women	have	drawn	the	short	medical	straw	 be 	 cause 	 	it	now	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	 man 	 y 	 	of	these	 drug 	 s 	 	do	n't	work	 near 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	on	women	 a 	 s 	 	they	do	on	men	--	and	the	 drug 	 s 	 	that	do	work	well	work	so	well	that	they	're	 active 	 ly 	 	 harm 	 ful 	 	for	women	to	take	.
 Be 	 ing 	 	a	rebel	is	about	 recogn 	 izing 	 	that	 expert 	 s 	 	'	 assumption 	 s 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 method 	 o 	 logies 	 	can	 eas 	 ily 	 	be	 flaw 	 ed 	 	.
Second	,	we	need	to	create	the	space	for	what	I	call	``	 manage 	 d 	 	 dis 	 s 	 ent 	 	.	''
If	we	are	to	shift	 paradigm 	 s 	 	,	if	we	are	to	make	 break 	 through 	 s 	 	,	if	we	are	to	destroy	 myth 	 s 	 	,	we	need	to	create	an	environment	in	which	expert	 idea 	 s 	 	are	 batt 	 ling 	 	it	out	,	in	which	we	're	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	in	new	,	 divers 	 e 	 	,	 dis 	 cord 	 ant 	 	,	 here 	 tic 	 al 	 	 view 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 discuss 	 ion 	 	,	 fear 	 lessly 	 	,	in	the	knowledge	that	progress	 come 	 s 	 	about	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	from	the	creation	of	 idea 	 s 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	from	 the 	 ir 	 	 destruct 	 ion 	 	--	and	 al 	 so 	 	from	the	knowledge	that	,	by	 surround 	 ing 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	by	 diverge 	 nt 	 	,	 dis 	 cord 	 ant 	 	,	 here 	 tic 	 al 	 	 view 	 s 	 	.
All	the	research	now	 show 	 s 	 	us	that	 th 	 is 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 make 	 s 	 	us	 smart 	 er 	 	.
 Encou 	 rag 	 ing 	 	 dis 	 s 	 ent 	 	is	a	 re 	 bell 	 ious 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 go 	 es 	 	against	our	 ver 	 y 	 	 instinct 	 s 	 	,	which	are	to	surround	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	with	 opinion 	 s 	 	and	 ad 	 vice 	 	that	we	 al 	 ready 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	or	want	to	be	true	.
And	that	's	why	I	talk	about	the	need	to	 active 	 ly 	 	manage	 dis 	 s 	 ent 	 	.
Google	CEO	 Er 	 ic 	 	 Sch 	 mid 	 t 	 	is	a	practical	practitioner	of	 th 	 is 	 	 philosoph 	 y 	 	.
In	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	he	 look 	 s 	 	out	for	the	person	in	the	room	--	 arm 	 s 	 	 cross 	 ed 	 	,	looking	a	bit	 be 	 mus 	 ed 	 	--	and	 draw 	 s 	 	them	 in 	 to 	 	the	 discuss 	 ion 	 	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	see	if	they	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	are	the	person	with	a	different	opinion	,	so	that	they	have	 dis 	 s 	 ent 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	room	.
 Man 	 aging 	 	 dis 	 s 	 ent 	 	is	about	 recogn 	 izing 	 	the	value	of	 disagree 	 ment 	 	,	 dis 	 cord 	 	and	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
But	we	need	to	go	even	further	.
We	need	to	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	 re 	 define 	 	who	it	is	that	 expert 	 s 	 	are	.
The	 convention 	 al 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	is	that	 expert 	 s 	 	are	people	with	 advance 	 d 	 	 degree 	 s 	 	,	 f 	 ancy 	 	 title 	 s 	 	,	 diploma 	 s 	 	,	 best 	 - 	 selling 	 	 book 	 s 	 	--	 high 	 - 	 stat 	 us 	 	 individual 	 s 	 	.
But	just	imagine	if	we	 we 	 re 	 	to	junk	 th 	 is 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	of	 expert 	 ise 	 	 a 	 s 	 	some	sort	of	elite	 cad 	 re 	 	and	 in 	 stead 	 	embrace	the	 not 	 ion 	 	of	 democrat 	 ized 	 	 expert 	 ise 	 	--	 where 	 by 	 	 expert 	 ise 	 	was	not	just	the	preserve	of	 surgeon 	 s 	 	and	CEO	's	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	 shop 	 - 	 girl 	 s 	 	--	 yea 	 h 	 	.

I	'd	like	to	talk	about	my	dad	.
My	dad	 ha 	 s 	 	Alzheimer	's	disease	.
He	 start 	 ed 	 	 show 	 ing 	 	the	 symptom 	 s 	 	about	12	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	he	was	 official 	 ly 	 	 diagnos 	 ed 	 	in	2005	.
 N 	 ow 	 	he	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	sick	.	He	 need 	 s 	 	help	eating	,	he	 need 	 s 	 	help	 get 	 ting 	 	 dress 	 ed 	 	,	he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	know	where	he	is	or	when	it	is	,	and	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	.
My	dad	was	my	hero	and	my	mentor	for	most	of	my	life	,	and	I	've	 s 	 pent 	 	the	last	decade	 watch 	 ing 	 	him	disappear	.
My	dad	's	not	 al 	 one 	 	.	There	's	about	35	million	people	 global 	 ly 	 	living	with	some	kind	of	 de 	 ment 	 ia 	 	,	and	by	2030	they	're	 expect 	 ing 	 	that	to	double	to	70	million	.
That	's	a	lot	of	people	.
Dementia	 s 	 care 	 s 	 	us	.	The	 con 	 fused 	 	 face 	 s 	 	and	 sha 	 ky 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	of	people	who	have	 de 	 ment 	 ia 	 	,	the	big	 number 	 s 	 	of	people	who	get	it	,	they	frighten	us	.
And	 be 	 cause 	 	of	that	fear	,	we	tend	to	do	one	of	two	 thing 	 s 	 	:	We	go	 in 	 to 	 	 deni 	 al 	 	:	``	It	's	not	me	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	me	,	it	's	never	going	to	happen	to	me	.	''
Or	,	we	decide	that	we	're	going	to	prevent	 de 	 ment 	 ia 	 	,	and	it	will	never	happen	to	us	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	going	to	do	 every 	 thing 	 	right	and	it	wo	n't	come	and	get	us	.
I	'm	looking	for	a	third	way	:	I	'm	 pre 	 par 	 ing 	 	to	get	Alzheimer	's	disease	.
 Prevent 	 ion 	 	is	good	,	and	I	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	can	do	to	prevent	Alzheimer	's	.
I	'm	eating	right	,	I	'm	 exercis 	 ing 	 	every	day	,	I	'm	 keep 	 ing 	 	my	mind	active	,	that	's	what	the	research	 say 	 s 	 	you	should	do	.
But	the	research	 al 	 so 	 	 show 	 s 	 	that	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	that	will	100	percent	protect	you	.
If	the	 mon 	 ster 	 	 want 	 s 	 	you	,	the	 mon 	 ster 	 	's	gon	na	get	you	.
That	's	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	with	my	dad	.
My	dad	was	a	 bi 	 lingual 	 	college	professor	.	 Hi 	 s 	 	 hob 	 bie 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 ches 	 s 	 	,	bridge	and	writing	 op 	 - 	 ed 	 s 	 	.
He	got	 de 	 ment 	 ia 	 	 any 	 way 	 	.
If	the	 mon 	 ster 	 	 want 	 s 	 	you	,	the	 mon 	 ster 	 	's	gon	na	get	you	.
 E 	 special 	 ly 	 	if	you	're	me	,	'cause	Alzheimer	's	 tend 	 s 	 	to	run	in	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	.
So	I	'm	 pre 	 par 	 ing 	 	to	get	Alzheimer	's	disease	.
 Bas 	 ed 	 	on	what	I	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	from	taking	care	of	my	father	,	and	 research 	 ing 	 	what	it	's	like	to	live	with	 de 	 ment 	 ia 	 	,	I	'm	 focus 	 ing 	 	on	three	 thing 	 s 	 	in	my	 pre 	 par 	 ation 	 	:	I	'm	changing	what	I	do	for	 f 	 un 	 	,	I	'm	 work 	 ing 	 	to	build	my	physical	strength	,	and	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	hard	one	--	I	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	better	person	.
Let	's	start	with	the	 hob 	 bie 	 s 	 	.	When	you	get	 de 	 ment 	 ia 	 	,	it	 get 	 s 	 	 hard 	 er 	 	and	 hard 	 er 	 	to	enjoy	 your 	 self 	 	.
You	ca	n't	 s 	 it 	 	and	have	long	 talk 	 s 	 	with	your	old	 friend 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	do	n't	know	who	they	are	.
It	's	 con 	 fusing 	 	to	watch	 tele 	 vision 	 	,	and	often	 ver 	 y 	 	 frighten 	 ing 	 	.
And	 read 	 ing 	 	is	just	about	 im 	 possible 	 	.
When	you	care	for	 some 	 one 	 	with	 de 	 ment 	 ia 	 	,	and	you	get	training	,	they	train	you	to	engage	them	in	 activ 	 ities 	 	that	are	familiar	,	 hand 	 s 	 - 	 on 	 	,	 open 	 - 	 end 	 ed 	 	.
With	my	dad	,	that	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	to	be	 lett 	 ing 	 	him	fill	out	 form 	 s 	 	.
He	was	a	college	professor	at	a	state	school	;	he	 know 	 s 	 	what	 paper 	 work 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
He	'll	sign	his	name	on	every	line	,	he	'll	check	all	the	boxes	,	he	'll	put	 number 	 s 	 	in	where	he	 think 	 s 	 	there	should	be	 number 	 s 	 	.
But	it	got	me	 think 	 ing 	 	,	what	would	my	 care 	 giver 	 s 	 	do	with	me	?
I	'm	my	father	's	daughter	.	I	read	,	I	write	,	I	think	about	global	health	a	lot	.
Would	they	give	me	academic	 journal 	 s 	 	so	I	could	 s 	 crib 	 ble 	 	in	the	 margin 	 s 	 	?
Would	they	give	me	 chart 	 s 	 	and	 graph 	 s 	 	that	I	could	color	?
So	I	've	 be 	 en 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	learn	to	do	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 hand 	 s 	 - 	 on 	 	.
I	've	 al 	 ways 	 	 like 	 d 	 	to	draw	,	so	I	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	it	more	even	 th 	 ough 	 	I	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	bad	at	it	.
I	am	 learn 	 ing 	 	some	 bas 	 ic 	 	origami	.	I	can	make	a	 re 	 ally 	 	great	box	.
And	I	'm	 teach 	 ing 	 	 my 	 self 	 	to	knit	,	which	so	far	I	can	knit	a	blob	.
But	,	you	know	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	if	I	'm	 actual 	 ly 	 	good	at	it	.	What	 matter 	 s 	 	is	that	my	 hand 	 s 	 	know	how	to	do	it	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	the	more	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	familiar	,	the	more	 thing 	 s 	 	my	 hand 	 s 	 	know	how	to	do	,	the	more	 thing 	 s 	 	that	I	can	be	happy	and	 bus 	 y 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	when	my	brain	's	not	running	the	show	 any 	 more 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	say	that	people	who	are	 engag 	 ed 	 	in	 activ 	 ities 	 	are	 hap 	 pi 	 er 	 	,	 eas 	 ier 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 care 	 giver 	 s 	 	to	look	after	,	and	it	may	even	 s 	 low 	 	the	progress	of	the	disease	.
That	all	 seem 	 s 	 	like	win	to	me	.
I	want	to	be	 a 	 s 	 	happy	 a 	 s 	 	I	can	for	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	I	can	.
A	lot	of	people	do	n't	know	that	Alzheimer	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	physical	 symptom 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	cognitive	 symptom 	 s 	 	.	You	lose	your	sense	of	balance	,	you	get	muscle	 trem 	 ors 	 	,	and	that	 tend 	 s 	 	to	lead	people	to	 be 	 ing 	 	less	and	less	mobile	.
 The 	 y 	 	get	 scar 	 ed 	 	to	walk	around	.	 The 	 y 	 	get	 scar 	 ed 	 	to	move	.
So	I	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	 activ 	 ities 	 	that	will	build	my	sense	of	balance	.
I	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	 y 	 oga 	 	and	 ta 	 i 	 	chi	to	improve	my	balance	,	so	that	when	I	start	to	lose	it	,	I	'll	still	be	able	to	be	mobile	.
I	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	weight-bearing	 exercis 	 e 	 	,	so	that	I	have	the	muscle	strength	so	that	when	I	start	to	 with 	 er 	 	,	I	have	more	time	that	I	can	still	move	around	.
 Fin 	 ally 	 	,	the	third	thing	.	I	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	better	person	.
My	dad	was	kind	and	loving	before	he	had	Alzheimer	's	,	and	he	's	kind	and	loving	now	.
I	've	 s 	 een 	 	him	lose	his	 in 	 tell 	 ect 	 	,	his	sense	of	humor	,	his	language	 skill 	 s 	 	,	but	I	've	 al 	 so 	 	 s 	 een 	 	 th 	 is 	 	:	He	 love 	 s 	 	me	,	he	 love 	 s 	 	my	 son 	 s 	 	,	he	 love 	 s 	 	my	brother	and	my	mom	and	his	 care 	 giver 	 s 	 	.
And	that	love	 make 	 s 	 	us	want	to	be	around	him	,	even	now	.
even	when	it	's	so	hard	.
When	you	take	away	 every 	 thing 	 	that	he	ever	 learn 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	world	,	his	naked	heart	still	 shine 	 s 	 	.
I	was	never	 a 	 s 	 	kind	 a 	 s 	 	my	dad	,	and	I	was	never	 a 	 s 	 	loving	.
And	what	I	need	now	is	to	learn	to	be	like	that	.
I	need	a	heart	so	 pur 	 e 	 	that	if	it	's	 strip 	 ped 	 	bare	by	 de 	 ment 	 ia 	 	,	it	will	 surviv 	 e 	 	.
I	do	n't	want	to	get	Alzheimer	's	disease	.
What	I	want	is	a	cure	in	the	next	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	soon	 en 	 ough 	 	to	protect	me	.
But	if	it	 come 	 s 	 	for	me	,	I	'm	going	to	be	ready	.
Thank	you	.

Can	you	understand	my	 qu 	 ain 	 t 	 	English	accent	?
Like	 every 	 body 	 	else	,	I	was	 en 	 trance 	 d 	 	 yester 	 day 	 	by	the	animal	session	.
 Ro 	 bert 	 	Full	and	Frans	 Lan 	 ting 	 	and	 other 	 s 	 	--	the	 beaut 	 y 	 	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	they	 show 	 ed 	 	.
The	 on 	 ly 	 	 s 	 light 	 	 jar 	 ring 	 	note	was	when	 Jeff 	 re 	 y 	 	 Kat 	 zen 	 berg 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	of	the	 must 	 ang 	 	,	``	the	most	splendid	 creature 	 s 	 	that	God	put	on	 th 	 is 	 	earth	.	''
 N 	 ow 	 	of	course	,	we	know	that	he	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	mean	that	,	but	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	at	the	moment	,	you	ca	n't	be	too	 care 	 ful 	 	.
I	'm	a	biologist	,	and	the	central	 theor 	 em 	 	of	our	subject	:	the	 theor 	 y 	 	of	design	,	Darwin	's	 theor 	 y 	 	of	evolution	by	natural	 s 	 election 	 	.
In	professional	 circle 	 s 	 	 every 	 where 	 	,	it	's	of	course	 universal 	 ly 	 	 accept 	 ed 	 	.
In	 non 	 - 	 professional 	 	 circle 	 s 	 	 out 	 side 	 	America	,	it	's	 large 	 ly 	 	 ignor 	 ed 	 	.
But	in	 non 	 - 	 professional 	 	 circle 	 s 	 	 with 	 in 	 	America	,	it	 arouse 	 s 	 	so	much	 hostil 	 ity 	 	--	--	that	it	's	fair	to	say	that	American	 biologist 	 s 	 	are	in	a	state	of	war	.
The	war	is	so	 worry 	 ing 	 	at	present	,	with	court	 case 	 s 	 	coming	up	in	one	state	after	 an 	 other 	 	,	that	I	felt	I	had	to	say	 some 	 thing 	 	about	it	.
If	you	want	to	know	what	I	have	to	say	about	 Darwin 	 ism 	 	 it 	 self 	 	,	I	'm	 af 	 raid 	 	you	're	going	to	have	to	look	at	my	 book 	 s 	 	,	which	you	wo	n't	find	in	the	 book 	 store 	 	 out 	 side 	 	.
 Con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	court	 case 	 s 	 	often	concern	an	 alle 	 ged 	 ly 	 	new	version	of	 creation 	 ism 	 	,	 call 	 ed 	 	``	Intelligent	Design	,	''	or	ID	.
Do	n't	be	 fool 	 ed 	 	.	There	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	new	about	ID	.
It	's	just	 creation 	 ism 	 	under	 an 	 other 	 	name	,	 re 	 christen 	 ed 	 	--	I	 choos 	 e 	 	the	word	 advise 	 d 	 ly 	 	--	--	for	 tactic 	 al 	 	,	 politic 	 al 	 	 reason 	 s 	 	.
The	 argument 	 s 	 	of	 so 	 - 	 call 	 ed 	 	ID	 theor 	 ists 	 	are	the	same	old	 argument 	 s 	 	that	had	 be 	 en 	 	 re 	 fu 	 ted 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	and	 aga 	 in 	 	,	since	Darwin	down	to	the	present	day	.
There	is	an	effective	evolution	lobby	 coordi 	 nating 	 	the	fight	on	 be 	 half 	 	of	science	,	and	I	try	to	do	all	I	can	to	help	them	,	but	they	get	 quit 	 e 	 	 up 	 set 	 	when	people	like	me	 da 	 re 	 	to	 ment 	 ion 	 	that	we	happen	to	be	 atheist 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	 evolution 	 ists 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	see	us	 a 	 s 	 	 rock 	 ing 	 	the	boat	,	and	you	can	understand	why	.
 Cre 	 ation 	 ists 	 	,	 lack 	 ing 	 	any	 cohere 	 nt 	 	scientific	argument	for	 the 	 ir 	 	case	,	fall	back	on	the	popular	phobia	against	 a 	 theism 	 	.
Teach	your	children	evolution	in	biology	class	,	and	they	'll	soon	move	on	to	 drug 	 s 	 	,	grand	larceny	and	sexual	 pre 	 - 	 version 	 	.
In	fact	,	of	course	,	educated	 theo 	 log 	 ians 	 	from	the	 Pop 	 e 	 	down	are	firm	in	 the 	 ir 	 	support	of	evolution	.
 Th 	 is 	 	book	,	``	 Find 	 ing 	 	Darwin	's	God	,	''	by	 Ken 	 ne 	 th 	 	 Mill 	 er 	 	,	is	one	of	the	most	effective	 attack 	 s 	 	on	Intelligent	Design	that	I	know	,	and	it	's	all	the	more	effective	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	written	by	a	 dev 	 out 	 	 Christ 	 ian 	 	.
People	like	 Ken 	 ne 	 th 	 	 Mill 	 er 	 	could	be	 call 	 ed 	 	a	``	 god 	 s 	 end 	 	''	to	the	evolution	lobby	--	--	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 ex 	 pose 	 	the	lie	that	 evolution 	 ism 	 	is	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	matter	of	fact	,	 t 	 ant 	 amount 	 	to	 a 	 theism 	 	.
People	like	me	,	on	the	other	hand	,	rock	the	boat	.
But	here	,	I	want	to	say	 some 	 thing 	 	nice	about	 creation 	 ists 	 	.
It	's	not	a	thing	I	often	do	,	so	listen	 care 	 fully 	 	.
I	think	they	're	right	about	one	thing	.
I	think	they	're	right	that	evolution	is	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	 hostil 	 e 	 	to	 relig 	 ion 	 	.
I	've	 al 	 ready 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	that	 man 	 y 	 	individual	 evolution 	 ists 	 	,	like	the	 Pop 	 e 	 	,	are	 al 	 so 	 	religious	,	but	I	think	they	're	 delud 	 ing 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
I	 believ 	 e 	 	a	true	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	 Darwin 	 ism 	 	is	 deep 	 ly 	 	 corros 	 ive 	 	to	religious	faith	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	it	may	sound	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	I	'm	about	to	preach	 a 	 theism 	 	,	and	I	want	to	 re 	 assure 	 	you	that	that	's	not	what	I	'm	going	to	do	.
In	an	audience	 a 	 s 	 	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	one	,	that	would	be	 preach 	 ing 	 	to	the	choir	.
No	,	what	I	want	to	urge	 up 	 on 	 	you	--	--	 in 	 stead 	 	what	I	want	to	urge	 up 	 on 	 	you	is	militant	 a 	 theism 	 	.
But	that	's	 put 	 ting 	 	it	too	 negative 	 ly 	 	.
If	I	was	a	person	who	 we 	 re 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 pre 	 serv 	 ing 	 	religious	faith	,	I	would	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 af 	 raid 	 	of	the	positive	power	of	 evolution 	 ary 	 	science	,	and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	science	 general 	 ly 	 	,	but	evolution	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	to	inspire	and	enthrall	,	 precise 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	 atheist 	 ic 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	the	difficult	problem	for	any	 theor 	 y 	 	of	 bio 	 logical 	 	design	is	to	explain	the	massive	 statistic 	 al 	 	 im 	 prob 	 ability 	 	of	living	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 Statistic 	 al 	 	 im 	 prob 	 ability 	 	in	the	direction	of	good	design	--	``	 complex 	 ity 	 	''	is	 an 	 other 	 	word	for	 th 	 is 	 	.
The	standard	 creation 	 ist 	 	argument	--	there	is	 on 	 ly 	 	one	;	they	all	 reduc 	 e 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	one	--	 take 	 s 	 	off	from	a	 statistic 	 al 	 	 im 	 prob 	 ability 	 	.
 Liv 	 ing 	 	 creature 	 s 	 	are	too	complex	to	have	come	about	by	chance	;	 there 	 fore 	 	,	they	must	have	had	a	 design 	 er 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	argument	of	course	,	 shoot 	 s 	 	 it 	 self 	 	in	the	foot	.
Any	 design 	 er 	 	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 design 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	complex	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	even	more	complex	 him 	 self 	 	,	and	that	's	before	we	even	start	on	the	other	 thing 	 s 	 	he	's	 expect 	 ed 	 	to	do	,	like	forgive	 s 	 in 	 s 	 	,	bless	 marriage 	 s 	 	,	listen	to	 pray 	 ers 	 	--	favor	our	side	in	a	war	--	--	 dis 	 ap 	 prove 	 	of	our	 s 	 ex 	 	 live 	 s 	 	and	so	on	.
 Com 	 plex 	 ity 	 	is	the	problem	that	any	 theor 	 y 	 	of	biology	 ha 	 s 	 	to	solve	,	and	you	ca	n't	solve	it	by	 post 	 ul 	 ating 	 	an	agent	that	is	even	more	complex	,	 there 	 by 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	 com 	 pound 	 ing 	 	the	problem	.
 Darwin 	 ian 	 	natural	 s 	 election 	 	is	so	 stunn 	 ing 	 ly 	 	elegant	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 solve 	 s 	 	the	problem	of	 explain 	 ing 	 	 complex 	 ity 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 noth 	 ing 	 	but	 simpl 	 icity 	 	.
 Essential 	 ly 	 	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	it	by	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	a	smooth	ramp	of	 gradu 	 al 	 	 step 	 - 	 by 	 - 	 step 	 	increment	.
But	here	,	I	 on 	 ly 	 	want	to	make	the	point	that	the	 e 	 leg 	 ance 	 	of	 Darwin 	 ism 	 	is	 corros 	 ive 	 	to	 relig 	 ion 	 	 precise 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	so	elegant	,	so	 par 	 s 	 im 	 on 	 ious 	 	,	so	 power 	 ful 	 	,	so	 economic 	 ally 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	.
It	 ha 	 s 	 	the	 sinew 	 y 	 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	of	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 s 	 us 	 pension 	 	bridge	.
The	God	 theor 	 y 	 	is	not	just	a	bad	 theor 	 y 	 	.
It	 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	be	,	in	principle	,	 in 	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 do 	 ing 	 	the	job	 requir 	 ed 	 	of	it	.
So	,	 return 	 ing 	 	to	 tactic 	 s 	 	and	the	evolution	lobby	,	I	want	to	 argu 	 e 	 	that	 rock 	 ing 	 	the	boat	may	be	just	the	right	thing	to	do	.
My	approach	to	 attack 	 ing 	 	 creation 	 ism 	 	is	 un 	 like 	 	the	evolution	lobby	.
My	approach	to	 attack 	 ing 	 	 creation 	 ism 	 	is	to	attack	 relig 	 ion 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	whole	,	and	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	I	need	to	 acknowledg 	 e 	 	the	 remark 	 able 	 	taboo	against	 s 	 peaking 	 	ill	of	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	and	I	'm	going	to	do	so	in	the	 word 	 s 	 	of	the	late	Douglas	 Adam 	 s 	 	,	a	dear	friend	who	,	if	he	never	came	to	TED	,	 certain 	 ly 	 	should	have	 be 	 en 	 	 invit 	 ed 	 	.

 Inc 	 ident 	 ally 	 	,	I	'm	not	 usual 	 ly 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	proud	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 Brit 	 ish 	 	,	but	you	ca	n't	help	making	the	 compar 	 ison 	 	.
In	practice	,	what	is	an	atheist	?
An	atheist	is	just	 some 	 body 	 	who	 feel 	 s 	 	about	 Ya 	 hweh 	 	the	way	any	 de 	 cent 	 	 Christ 	 ian 	 	 feel 	 s 	 	about	 Th 	 or 	 	or	 Ba 	 al 	 	or	the	 gold 	 en 	 	 ca 	 lf 	 	.
 A 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	before	,	we	are	all	 atheist 	 s 	 	about	most	of	the	 god 	 s 	 	that	 human 	 ity 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	ever	 believ 	 ed 	 	in	.	Some	of	us	just	go	one	god	further	.
And	 how 	 ever 	 	we	define	 a 	 theism 	 	,	it	's	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	the	kind	of	academic	belief	that	a	person	is	 en 	 titled 	 	to	hold	 with 	 out 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 vil 	 ified 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	 un 	 patriot 	 ic 	 	,	 un 	 elect 	 able 	 	 non 	 - 	 citizen 	 	.
 Never 	 the 	 less 	 	,	it	's	an	 un 	 deni 	 able 	 	fact	that	to	own	up	to	 be 	 ing 	 	an	atheist	is	 t 	 ant 	 amount 	 	to	 introduc 	 ing 	 	 your 	 self 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 Mr 	 . 	 	 Hit 	 ler 	 	or	Miss	 Be 	 el 	 ze 	 bub 	 	.
And	that	all	 stem 	 s 	 	from	the	 per 	 ception 	 	of	 atheist 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	some	kind	of	weird	,	 way 	 - 	 out 	 	 minor 	 ity 	 	.
 Nat 	 al 	 ie 	 	 Angi 	 er 	 	wrote	a	 ra 	 ther 	 	 s 	 ad 	 	piece	in	the	New	 York 	 er 	 	,	 say 	 ing 	 	how	 lone 	 ly 	 	she	felt	 a 	 s 	 	an	atheist	.
She	 clear 	 ly 	 	 feel 	 s 	 	in	a	 bel 	 eaguer 	 ed 	 	 minor 	 ity 	 	,	but	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	how	do	American	 atheist 	 s 	 	stack	up	 numeric 	 ally 	 	?
The	 lat 	 est 	 	survey	 make 	 s 	 	 surprising 	 ly 	 	 encourag 	 ing 	 	 read 	 ing 	 	.
 Christ 	 ian 	 ity 	 	,	of	course	,	 take 	 s 	 	a	massive	lion	's	share	of	the	population	,	with	 near 	 ly 	 	160	million	.
But	what	would	you	think	was	the	second	largest	group	,	 convincing 	 ly 	 	 out 	 number 	 ing 	 	 Jew 	 s 	 	with	2.8	million	,	 Muslim 	 s 	 	at	1.1	million	,	and	 Hindu 	 s 	 	,	 Buddhist 	 s 	 	and	all	other	 relig 	 ions 	 	put	together	?
The	second	largest	group	,	of	 near 	 ly 	 	30	million	,	is	the	one	 de 	 scribed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 non 	 - 	 religious 	 	or	secular	.
You	ca	n't	help	 wonder 	 ing 	 	why	 vote 	 - 	 seeking 	 	 politic 	 ians 	 	are	so	 proverbial 	 ly 	 	 over 	 awe 	 d 	 	by	the	power	of	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	the	 Jew 	 ish 	 	lobby	.
The	state	of	Israel	 seem 	 s 	 	to	owe	 it 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 exist 	 ence 	 	to	the	American	 Jew 	 ish 	 	vote	,	while	at	the	same	time	 con 	 sign 	 ing 	 	the	 non 	 - 	 religious 	 	to	 politic 	 al 	 	 obliv 	 ion 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	secular	 non 	 - 	 religious 	 	vote	,	if	 proper 	 ly 	 	 mobilize 	 d 	 	,	is	nine	 time 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 nume 	 r 	 ous 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 Jew 	 ish 	 	vote	.

Well	,	so	much	for	 quant 	 ity 	 	.	How	about	quality	?
 I 	 s 	 	there	any	correlation	,	positive	or	negative	,	between	 intellig 	 ence 	 	and	 tend 	 ency 	 	to	be	religious	?
The	survey	that	I	 quote 	 d 	 	,	which	is	the	 AR 	 IS 	 	survey	,	did	n't	break	down	 it 	 s 	 	data	by	 socio 	 - 	 economic 	 	class	or	education	,	 I 	 Q 	 	or	 any 	 thing 	 	else	.
But	a	 re 	 cent 	 	article	by	Paul	G.	Bell	in	the	 Men 	 s 	 a 	 	magazine	 provide 	 s 	 	some	 straw 	 s 	 	in	the	wind	.
 Men 	 s 	 a 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	know	,	is	an	 inter 	 national 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 	for	people	with	 ver 	 y 	 	high	 I 	 Q 	 	.
And	from	a	 meta 	 - 	 analysis 	 	of	the	 liter 	 ature 	 	,	Bell	 conclude 	 s 	 	that	,	I	quote	,	``	Of	43	 stud 	 ies 	 	carried	out	since	1927	on	the	relationship	between	religious	belief	and	one	's	 intellig 	 ence 	 	or	 education 	 al 	 	level	,	all	but	four	found	an	 in 	 verse 	 	 connect 	 ion 	 	.
That	is	,	the	 high 	 er 	 	one	's	 intellig 	 ence 	 	or	 education 	 al 	 	level	,	the	less	one	is	 like 	 ly 	 	to	be	religious	.	''
Well	,	I	have	n't	 s 	 een 	 	the	original	42	 stud 	 ies 	 	and	I	ca	n't	comment	on	that	 meta 	 - 	 anaysis 	 	but	I	would	like	to	see	more	 stud 	 ies 	 	 d 	 one 	 	 a 	 long 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	lines	.
And	I	know	that	there	are	,	if	I	could	put	a	little	plug	here	,	there	are	people	in	 th 	 is 	 	audience	 eas 	 ily 	 	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 fin 	 anc 	 ing 	 	a	massive	research	survey	to	settle	the	question	,	and	I	put	the	 suggest 	 ion 	 	up	--	for	what	it	's	worth	.
But	let	me	know	show	you	some	data	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	 proper 	 ly 	 	 publish 	 ed 	 	and	 analyz 	 ed 	 	on	one	special	group	,	 name 	 ly 	 	,	top	 scientist 	 s 	 	.

 Ab 	 out 	 	20	percent	are	agnostic	,	and	the	rest	could	 fair 	 ly 	 	be	 call 	 ed 	 	 atheist 	 s 	 	.
Similar	 figure 	 s 	 	 obtain 	 ed 	 	for	belief	in	personal	 im 	 mortal 	 ity 	 	.
Among	 bio 	 logical 	 	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	the	 figure 	 s 	 	are	even	lower	:	5.5	percent	,	 on 	 ly 	 	,	 believ 	 e 	 	in	God	.	 Physic 	 al 	 	 scientist 	 s 	 	:	it	's	7.5	percent	.
I	've	not	 s 	 een 	 	 correspond 	 ing 	 	 figure 	 s 	 	for	elite	 scholar 	 s 	 	in	other	 field 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	or	 philosoph 	 y 	 	,	but	I	'd	be	 surprise 	 d 	 	if	they	 we 	 re 	 	different	.
So	,	we	've	 reach 	 ed 	 	a	 tru 	 ly 	 	 remark 	 able 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	,	a	 grot 	 es 	 que 	 	 mis 	 match 	 	between	the	American	 intelligent 	 s 	 ia 	 	and	the	American	 elect 	 or 	 ate 	 	.
A	 philosoph 	 ical 	 	opinion	about	the	nature	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	which	is	held	by	the	vast	 major 	 ity 	 	of	top	American	 scientist 	 s 	 	and	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	 major 	 ity 	 	of	the	 intelligent 	 s 	 ia 	 	 general 	 ly 	 	,	is	so	 abhor 	 rent 	 	to	the	American	 elect 	 or 	 ate 	 	that	no	 candid 	 ate 	 	for	popular	election	 da 	 re 	 	affirm	it	in	public	.
If	I	'm	right	,	 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	that	high	 off 	 ice 	 	in	the	 great 	 est 	 	country	in	the	world	is	 bar 	 red 	 	to	the	 ver 	 y 	 	people	best	 qual 	 ified 	 	to	hold	it	--	the	 intelligent 	 s 	 ia 	 	--	 un 	 less 	 	they	are	prepared	to	lie	about	 the 	 ir 	 	 belief 	 s 	 	.
To	put	it	 blunt 	 ly 	 	,	American	 politic 	 al 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	are	 heav 	 ily 	 	 load 	 ed 	 	against	 t 	 hose 	 	who	are	 simultaneous 	 ly 	 	intelligent	and	honest	.
I	'm	not	a	citizen	of	 th 	 is 	 	country	,	so	I	hope	it	wo	n't	be	thought	 un 	 be 	 coming 	 	if	I	suggest	that	 some 	 thing 	 	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	 d 	 one 	 	.
And	I	've	 al 	 ready 	 	 hint 	 ed 	 	what	that	 some 	 thing 	 	is	.
From	what	I	've	 s 	 een 	 	of	TED	,	I	think	 th 	 is 	 	may	be	the	ideal	place	to	launch	it	.
 Aga 	 in 	 	,	I	fear	it	will	cost	money	.
We	need	a	 conscious 	 ness 	 - 	 raising 	 	,	 coming 	 - 	 out 	 	campaign	for	American	 atheist 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	could	be	similar	to	the	campaign	 organize 	 d 	 	by	 homo 	 sexual 	 s 	 	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	heaven	forbid	that	we	should	 st 	 oop 	 	to	public	 out 	 ing 	 	of	people	against	 the 	 ir 	 	will	.
In	most	 case 	 s 	 	,	people	who	out	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	will	help	to	destroy	the	myth	that	there	is	 some 	 thing 	 	wrong	with	 atheist 	 s 	 	.
On	the	 contr 	 ary 	 	,	they	'll	 demonst 	 rate 	 	that	 atheist 	 s 	 	are	often	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	people	that	could	serve	 a 	 s 	 	 de 	 cent 	 	role	 model 	 s 	 	for	your	children	,	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	people	an	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	agent	could	use	to	recommend	a	product	,	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	people	who	are	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	.
There	should	be	a	 snow 	 ball 	 	effect	,	a	positive	 feed 	 back 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	that	the	more	 name 	 s 	 	we	have	,	the	more	we	get	.
There	could	be	 non 	 - 	 linear 	 ities 	 	,	threshold	 effect 	 s 	 	.
When	a	critical	mass	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 attain 	 ed 	 	,	there	's	an	abrupt	 accele 	 ration 	 	in	 recruit 	 ment 	 	.
And	 aga 	 in 	 	,	it	will	need	money	.
I	suspect	that	the	word	``	atheist	''	 it 	 self 	 	 contain 	 s 	 	or	 remain 	 s 	 	a	 s 	 tumbling 	 	block	far	out	of	proportion	to	what	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	,	and	a	 s 	 tumbling 	 	block	to	people	who	 other 	 wise 	 	might	be	happy	to	out	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
So	,	what	other	 word 	 s 	 	might	be	used	to	smooth	the	path	,	oil	the	 wheel 	 s 	 	,	sugar	the	pill	?	Darwin	 him 	 self 	 	 prefer 	 red 	 	``	agnostic	''	--	and	not	 on 	 ly 	 	out	of	 loyal 	 ty 	 	to	his	friend	 Hux 	 ley 	 	,	who	 co 	 in 	 ed 	 	the	term	.
Darwin	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	I	have	never	 be 	 en 	 	an	atheist	in	the	same	sense	of	 den 	 y 	 ing 	 	the	 exist 	 ence 	 	of	a	God	.
I	think	that	 general 	 ly 	 	an	'agnostic	'	would	be	the	most	correct	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	of	my	state	of	mind	.	''
He	even	 be 	 came 	 	 un 	 character 	 istically 	 	tetchy	with	Edward	 Ave 	 ling 	 	.
 Ave 	 ling 	 	was	a	militant	atheist	who	 fail 	 ed 	 	to	 persuad 	 e 	 	Darwin	to	accept	the	 d 	 ed 	 ic 	 ation 	 	of	his	book	on	 a 	 theism 	 	--	 incident 	 ally 	 	,	giving	rise	to	a	 fasci 	 nating 	 	myth	that	Karl	Marx	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	dedicate	``	 Da 	 s 	 	 Ka 	 pit 	 al 	 	''	to	Darwin	,	which	he	did	n't	.	It	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	Edward	 Ave 	 ling 	 	.
What	 happen 	 ed 	 	was	that	 Ave 	 ling 	 	's	 mi 	 stress 	 	was	Marx	's	daughter	,	and	when	both	Darwin	and	Marx	 we 	 re 	 	dead	,	Marx	's	 paper 	 s 	 	 be 	 came 	 	 muddle 	 d 	 	up	with	 Ave 	 ling 	 	's	 paper 	 s 	 	and	a	letter	from	Darwin	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	My	dear	 s 	 ir 	 	,	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	but	I	do	n't	want	you	to	dedicate	your	book	to	me	,	''	was	 mistak 	 en 	 ly 	 	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	 address 	 ed 	 	to	Marx	,	and	that	 g 	 ave 	 	rise	to	 th 	 is 	 	whole	myth	,	which	you	've	 prob 	 ably 	 	heard	.
It	's	a	sort	of	urban	myth	,	that	Marx	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	dedicate	``	 Ka 	 pit 	 al 	 	''	to	Darwin	.
 Any 	 way 	 	,	it	was	 Ave 	 ling 	 	,	and	when	they	met	,	Darwin	 challeng 	 ed 	 	 Ave 	 ling 	 	,	``	Why	do	you	call	 your 	 s 	 elves 	 	 atheist 	 s 	 	?	''
``	'Agnostic	,	'	''	 re 	 tort 	 ed 	 	 Ave 	 ling 	 	,	``	was	 simpl 	 y 	 	'atheist	'	writ	 respect 	 able 	 	,	and	'atheist	'	was	 simpl 	 y 	 	'agnostic	'	writ	 aggress 	 ive 	 	.	''
Darwin	 complain 	 ed 	 	,	``	But	why	should	you	be	so	 aggress 	 ive 	 	?	''
Darwin	thought	that	 a 	 theism 	 	might	be	well	and	good	for	the	 intelligent 	 s 	 ia 	 	,	but	that	 ordin 	 ary 	 	people	 we 	 re 	 	not	,	quote	,	``	 rip 	 e 	 	for	it	.	''
 Whi 	 ch 	 	is	,	of	course	,	our	old	friend	,	the	``	do	n't	rock	the	boat	''	argument	.
It	's	not	 record 	 ed 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	 Ave 	 ling 	 	told	Darwin	to	come	down	off	his	high	horse	.
But	in	any	case	,	that	was	more	than	100	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
You	think	we	might	have	grown	up	since	then	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	a	friend	,	an	intelligent	 lapse 	 d 	 	Jew	,	who	 incident 	 ally 	 	 observ 	 ed 	 	the	 S 	 ab 	 bath 	 	for	 reason 	 s 	 	of	cultural	 solid 	 arity 	 	,	 de 	 scribe 	 s 	 	 him 	 self 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	``	tooth	 fair 	 y 	 	agnostic	.	''
He	wo	n't	call	 him 	 self 	 	an	atheist	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	,	in	principle	,	 im 	 possible 	 	to	prove	a	negative	,	but	agnostic	on	 it 	 s 	 	own	might	suggest	that	God	's	 exist 	 ence 	 	was	 there 	 fore 	 	on	equal	 term 	 s 	 	of	 like 	 li 	 hood 	 	 a 	 s 	 	his	 non 	 - 	 exist 	 ence 	 	.
So	,	my	friend	is	 strict 	 ly 	 	agnostic	about	the	tooth	 fair 	 y 	 	,	but	it	is	n't	 ver 	 y 	 	 like 	 ly 	 	,	is	it	?	Like	God	.
 H 	 ence 	 	the	phrase	,	``	tooth	 fair 	 y 	 	agnostic	.	''
 Bert 	 rand 	 	 Rus 	 sell 	 	made	the	same	point	using	a	hypothetical	teapot	in	orbit	about	 Mar 	 s 	 	.
You	would	 strict 	 ly 	 	have	to	be	agnostic	about	 whet 	 her 	 	there	is	a	teapot	in	orbit	about	 Mar 	 s 	 	,	but	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	you	treat	the	 like 	 li 	 hood 	 	of	 it 	 s 	 	 exist 	 ence 	 	 a 	 s 	 	on	all	 four 	 s 	 	with	 it 	 s 	 	 non 	 - 	 exist 	 ence 	 	.
The	list	of	 thing 	 s 	 	which	we	 strict 	 ly 	 	have	to	be	agnostic	about	 do 	 es 	 	n't	stop	at	tooth	 fair 	 ies 	 	and	 teapot 	 s 	 	.	It	's	infinite	.
If	you	want	to	 believ 	 e 	 	one	 part 	 icular 	 	one	of	them	--	 uni 	 corn 	 s 	 	or	tooth	 fair 	 ies 	 	or	 teapot 	 s 	 	or	 Ya 	 hweh 	 	--	the	 on 	 us 	 	is	on	you	to	say	why	.
The	 on 	 us 	 	is	not	on	the	rest	of	us	to	say	why	not	.
We	,	who	are	 atheist 	 s 	 	,	are	 al 	 so 	 	 a 	 - 	 fair 	 iest 	 s 	 	and	 a 	 - 	 teapot 	 ists 	 	.
But	we	do	n't	 both 	 er 	 	to	say	so	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	why	my	friend	uses	``	tooth	 fair 	 y 	 	agnostic	''	 a 	 s 	 	a	label	for	what	most	people	would	call	atheist	.
 N 	 one 	 the 	 less 	 	,	if	we	want	to	attract	deep	down	 atheist 	 s 	 	to	come	out	 public 	 ly 	 	,	we	're	going	to	have	find	 some 	 thing 	 	better	to	stick	on	our	 bann 	 er 	 	than	``	tooth	 fair 	 y 	 	''	or	``	teapot	agnostic	.	''
So	,	how	about	``	 human 	 ist 	 	''	?
 Th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	the	advantage	of	a	 world 	 wide 	 	network	of	 well 	 - 	 organize 	 d 	 	 associ 	 ations 	 	and	 journal 	 s 	 	and	 thing 	 s 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	in	place	.
My	problem	with	it	 on 	 ly 	 	is	 it 	 s 	 	 ap 	 parent 	 	 anthropo 	 cent 	 r 	 ism 	 	.
One	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	from	Darwin	is	that	the	human	species	is	 on 	 ly 	 	one	among	 million 	 s 	 	of	 cousin 	 s 	 	,	some	close	,	some	 di 	 stant 	 	.
And	there	are	other	 possibil 	 ities 	 	like	``	 natural 	 ist 	 	,	''	but	that	 al 	 so 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	of	 con 	 fusion 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	Darwin	would	have	thought	 natural 	 ist 	 	--	``	 natural 	 ist 	 	''	 mean 	 s 	 	,	of	course	,	 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	``	 super 	 natural 	 ist 	 	''	--	and	it	is	used	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	--	Darwin	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	 con 	 fused 	 	by	the	other	sense	of	``	 natural 	 ist 	 	,	''	which	he	was	,	of	course	,	and	I	suppose	there	might	be	 other 	 s 	 	who	would	 con 	 fuse 	 	it	with	 nud 	 ism 	 	.
 S 	 uch 	 	people	might	be	 t 	 hose 	 	 belong 	 ing 	 	to	the	 Brit 	 ish 	 	 ly 	 nch 	 	mob	which	last	year	 attack 	 ed 	 	a	 pediatric 	 ian 	 	in	 mistak 	 e 	 	for	a	 ped 	 oph 	 ile 	 	.
I	think	the	best	of	the	 avail 	 able 	 	 alter 	 native 	 s 	 	for	``	atheist	''	is	 simpl 	 y 	 	``	 non 	 - 	 the 	 ist 	 	.	''
It	 lack 	 s 	 	the	strong	 con 	 not 	 ation 	 	that	there	's	 definite 	 ly 	 	no	God	,	and	it	could	 there 	 fore 	 	 eas 	 ily 	 	be	 embrace 	 d 	 	by	teapot	or	tooth	 fair 	 y 	 	 agnostic 	 s 	 	.
It	's	 complete 	 ly 	 	compatible	with	the	God	of	the	 physicist 	 s 	 	.
When	 atheist 	 s 	 	like	 Step 	 hen 	 	 Hawk 	 ing 	 	and	 Al 	 bert 	 	Einstein	use	the	word	``	God	,	''	they	use	it	of	course	 a 	 s 	 	a	 metaphor 	 ical 	 	 short 	 hand 	 	for	that	deep	,	 myster 	 ious 	 	part	of	physics	which	we	do	n't	yet	understand	.
``	 Non 	 - 	 the 	 ist 	 	''	will	do	for	all	that	,	yet	 un 	 like 	 	``	atheist	,	''	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	the	same	phobic	,	 hyster 	 ical 	 	 respons 	 es 	 	.
But	I	think	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	the	 alter 	 native 	 	is	to	grasp	the	 nett 	 le 	 	of	the	word	``	 a 	 theism 	 	''	 it 	 self 	 	,	 precise 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	a	taboo	word	 carry 	 ing 	 	 fris 	 son 	 s 	 	of	 hyster 	 ical 	 	phobia	.
 Critic 	 al 	 	mass	may	be	 hard 	 er 	 	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	with	the	word	``	atheist	''	than	with	the	word	``	 non 	 - 	 the 	 ist 	 	,	''	or	some	other	 non 	 - 	 confront 	 ation 	 al 	 	word	.
But	if	we	did	 achiev 	 e 	 	it	with	that	dread	word	--	``	atheist	''	 it 	 self 	 	--	the	 politic 	 al 	 	impact	would	be	even	 great 	 er 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	I	 s 	 aid 	 	that	if	I	 we 	 re 	 	religious	,	I	'd	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 af 	 raid 	 	of	evolution	.	I	'd	go	further	.
I	would	fear	science	in	general	if	 proper 	 ly 	 	 under 	 stood 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	the	scientific	 world 	 view 	 	is	so	much	more	 excit 	 ing 	 	,	more	 poet 	 ic 	 	,	more	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	 she 	 er 	 	wonder	than	 any 	 thing 	 	in	the	 poverty 	 - 	 stricken 	 	 arsenal 	 s 	 	of	the	religious	 imagin 	 ation 	 	.
 A 	 s 	 	Carl	 Sa 	 gan 	 	,	 an 	 other 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	dead	hero	,	put	it	,	``	How	is	it	that	 hard 	 ly 	 	any	major	 relig 	 ion 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	at	science	and	 conclude 	 d 	 	,	'This	is	better	than	we	thought	!
The	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	much	 big 	 ger 	 	than	our	prophet	 s 	 aid 	 	,	 grand 	 er 	 	,	more	subtle	,	more	elegant	?	'	 In 	 stead 	 	they	say	,	'No	,	no	,	no	!
My	god	is	a	little	god	,	and	I	want	him	to	stay	that	way	.	'	A	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	old	or	new	,	that	 stress 	 ed 	 	the	 magnific 	 ence 	 	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 reveal 	 ed 	 	by	modern	science	might	be	able	to	draw	forth	 re 	 serve 	 s 	 	of	reverence	and	awe	 hard 	 ly 	 	 ta 	 pped 	 	by	the	 convention 	 al 	 	 faith 	 s 	 	.	''
 N 	 ow 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	elite	audience	,	and	I	would	 there 	 fore 	 	expect	about	10	percent	of	you	to	be	religious	.
 Man 	 y 	 	of	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	 sub 	 scribe 	 	to	our	polite	cultural	belief	that	we	should	respect	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	but	I	 al 	 so 	 	suspect	that	a	fair	number	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 secret 	 ly 	 	 despis 	 e 	 	 relig 	 ion 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	I	do	.
If	you	're	one	of	them	,	and	of	course	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	may	not	be	,	but	if	you	are	one	of	them	,	I	'm	 ask 	 ing 	 	you	to	stop	 be 	 ing 	 	polite	,	come	out	and	say	so	,	and	if	you	happen	to	be	rich	,	give	some	thought	to	ways	in	which	you	might	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
The	religious	lobby	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	is	 massive 	 ly 	 	 finance 	 d 	 	by	 found 	 ations 	 	--	to	say	 noth 	 ing 	 	of	all	the	tax	 benefit 	 s 	 	--	by	 found 	 ations 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	Templeton	 Found 	 ation 	 	and	the	 Discover 	 y 	 	Institute	.
We	need	an	 anti 	 - 	 Templeton 	 	to	step	forward	.
If	my	 book 	 s 	 	 s 	 old 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	 Step 	 hen 	 	 Hawk 	 ing 	 	's	 book 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 on 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	 Rich 	 ard 	 	 Daw 	 kin 	 s 	 	'	 book 	 s 	 	,	I	'd	do	it	 my 	 self 	 	.
People	are	 al 	 ways 	 	going	on	about	,	``	How	did	September	the	11th	change	you	?	''
Well	,	here	's	how	it	 change 	 d 	 	me	.
Let	's	all	stop	 be 	 ing 	 	so	 damn 	 ed 	 	 respect 	 ful 	 	.
Thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
So	how	would	you	run	a	whole	country	 with 	 out 	 	oil	?
That	's	the	question	that	sort	of	hit	me	in	the	middle	of	a	Davos	afternoon	about	four	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
It	never	left	my	brain	.
And	I	 start 	 ed 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	with	it	more	like	a	 puzzl 	 e 	 	.
The	original	thought	I	had	:	 th 	 is 	 	must	be	ethanol	.
So	I	went	out	and	 research 	 ed 	 	ethanol	,	and	found	out	you	need	the	Amazon	in	your	 back 	 yard 	 	in	every	country	.
 Ab 	 out 	 	six	 month 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	I	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	it	must	be	hydrogen	,	 un 	 til 	 	some	scientist	told	me	the	 un 	 fortunate 	 	truth	,	which	is	,	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	use	more	clean	 electron 	 s 	 	than	the	 one 	 s 	 	you	get	 in 	 side 	 	a	car	,	if	you	use	hydrogen	.
So	that	is	not	going	to	be	the	path	to	go	.
And	then	sort	of	through	a	process	of	 wander 	 ing 	 	around	,	I	got	to	the	thought	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	if	you	could	convert	an	entire	country	to	electric	 car 	 s 	 	,	in	a	way	that	is	convenient	and	 afford 	 able 	 	,	you	could	get	to	a	solution	.
 N 	 ow 	 	I	 start 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	from	a	point	of	view	that	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 scale 	 s 	 	en	masse	.
Not	how	do	you	build	one	car	,	but	how	do	you	scale	 th 	 is 	 	so	that	it	can	 be 	 come 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	used	by	99	percent	of	the	population	?
The	thought	that	came	to	mind	is	that	it	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	 a 	 s 	 	good	 a 	 s 	 	any	car	that	you	would	have	 to 	 day 	 	.
So	one	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	more	convenient	than	a	car	.
And	two	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	be	more	 afford 	 able 	 	than	 to 	 day 	 	's	 car 	 s 	 	.
 Af 	 ford 	 able 	 	is	not	a	40,000	dollar	 s 	 ed 	 an 	 	,	right	?
 Al 	 right 	 	?	That	's	not	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	can	finance	or	buy	 to 	 day 	 	.
And	convenient	is	not	 some 	 thing 	 	that	you	drive	for	an	hour	and	charge	for	eight	.
So	we	're	bound	with	the	 law 	 s 	 	of	physics	and	the	 law 	 s 	 	of	 economic 	 s 	 	.
And	so	the	thought	that	I	 start 	 ed 	 	with	was	how	do	you	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	still	 with 	 in 	 	the	 bound 	 ary 	 	of	the	science	we	know	 to 	 day 	 	--	no	time	for	science	fair	,	no	time	for	 play 	 ing 	 	around	with	 thing 	 s 	 	or	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	the	magic	 batt 	 ery 	 	to	show	up	.
How	do	you	do	it	 with 	 in 	 	the	 economic 	 s 	 	that	we	have	 to 	 day 	 	?
How	do	you	do	it	from	the	power	of	the	consumer	up	?
And	not	from	the	power	of	an	 e 	 dict 	 	down	.
On	a	random	visit	to	Tesla	on	some	afternoon	,	I	 actual 	 ly 	 	found	out	that	the	answer	 come 	 s 	 	from	 separat 	 ing 	 	between	the	car	 owner 	 ship 	 	and	the	 batt 	 ery 	 	 owner 	 ship 	 	.
In	a	sense	if	you	want	to	think	about	it	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	classic	``	 batt 	 eries 	 	not	 include 	 d 	 	.	''
 N 	 ow 	 	if	you	 separat 	 e 	 	between	the	two	,	you	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	answer	the	need	for	a	convenient	car	by	creating	a	network	,	by	creating	a	network	before	the	 car 	 s 	 	show	up	.
The	network	 ha 	 s 	 	two	 component 	 s 	 	in	them	.
First	component	is	you	charge	the	car	 when 	 ever 	 	you	stop	--	 end 	 s 	 	up	that	 car 	 s 	 	are	these	strange	 beast 	 s 	 	that	drive	for	about	two	 hour 	 s 	 	and	park	for	about	22	 hour 	 s 	 	.
If	you	drive	a	car	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	and	drive	it	back	in	the	afternoon	the	ratio	of	charge	to	drive	is	about	a	minute	for	a	minute	.
And	so	the	first	thought	that	came	to	mind	is	,	 every 	 where 	 	we	park	we	have	electric	power	.
 N 	 ow 	 	it	 sound 	 s 	 	crazy	.	But	in	some	 place 	 s 	 	around	the	world	,	like	Scandinavia	,	you	 al 	 ready 	 	have	that	.
If	you	park	your	car	and	did	n't	plug	in	the	 heat 	 er 	 	,	when	you	come	back	you	do	n't	have	a	car	.	It	just	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	.
 N 	 ow 	 	that	last	mile	,	last	foot	,	in	a	sense	,	is	the	first	step	of	the	 infra 	 structure 	 	.
The	second	step	of	the	 infra 	 structure 	 	 need 	 s 	 	to	take	care	of	the	range	 extens 	 ion 	 	.
See	we	're	bound	by	 to 	 day 	 	's	technology	on	 batt 	 eries 	 	,	which	is	about	120	 mile 	 s 	 	if	you	want	to	stay	 with 	 in 	 	 reason 	 able 	 	space	and	weight	 limit 	 ations 	 	.
120	 mile 	 s 	 	is	a	good	 en 	 ough 	 	range	for	a	lot	of	people	.
But	you	never	want	to	get	 s 	 tuck 	 	.
So	what	we	 add 	 ed 	 	is	a	second	element	to	our	network	,	which	is	a	 batt 	 ery 	 	swap	system	.
You	drive	.	You	take	your	 deplete 	 d 	 	 batt 	 ery 	 	out	.
A	full	 batt 	 ery 	 	 come 	 s 	 	on	.	And	you	drive	on	.
You	do	n't	do	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	human	 be 	 ing 	 	.	You	do	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	machine	.
It	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	car	 wash 	 . 	 	You	come	 in 	 to 	 	your	car	wash	.
And	a	plate	 come 	 s 	 	up	,	 hold 	 s 	 	your	 batt 	 ery 	 	,	 take 	 s 	 	it	out	,	 put 	 s 	 	it	back	in	,	and	 with 	 in 	 	two	 minute 	 s 	 	you	're	back	on	the	road	and	you	can	go	 aga 	 in 	 	.
If	you	had	charge	 spot 	 s 	 	 every 	 where 	 	,	and	you	had	 batt 	 ery 	 	swap	 station 	 s 	 	 every 	 where 	 	,	how	often	would	you	do	it	?	And	it	 end 	 s 	 	up	that	you	'd	do	 swap 	 ping 	 	less	 time 	 s 	 	than	you	stop	at	a	gas	station	.
 A 	 s 	 	a	matter	of	fact	,	we	 add 	 ed 	 	to	the	contract	.
We	 s 	 aid 	 	that	if	you	stop	to	swap	your	 batt 	 ery 	 	more	than	50	 time 	 s 	 	a	year	we	start	 pay 	 ing 	 	you	money	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	an	 in 	 convenience 	 	.
 Th 	 en 	 	we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	question	of	the	 afford 	 ability 	 	.
We	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	question	,	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	the	 batt 	 ery 	 	is	 dis 	 connect 	 ed 	 	from	the	car	.
What	is	the	cost	of	that	 batt 	 ery 	 	?
 Every 	 body 	 	 tell 	 s 	 	us	 batt 	 eries 	 	are	so	expensive	.
What	we	found	out	,	when	you	move	from	 molecule 	 s 	 	to	 electron 	 s 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	.
We	can	go	back	to	the	original	 economic 	 s 	 	of	the	car	and	look	at	it	 aga 	 in 	 	.
The	 batt 	 ery 	 	is	not	the	gas	tank	,	in	a	sense	.
 Re 	 member 	 	in	your	car	you	have	a	gas	tank	.
You	have	the	 crud 	 e 	 	oil	.
And	you	have	 re 	 fin 	 ing 	 	and	 deliver 	 y 	 	of	that	 crud 	 e 	 	oil	 a 	 s 	 	what	we	call	 petro 	 l 	 	or	 gas 	 o 	 line 	 	.
The	 batt 	 ery 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	sense	,	is	the	 crud 	 e 	 	oil	.
We	have	a	 batt 	 ery 	 	 ba 	 y 	 	.	It	 cost 	 s 	 	the	same	hundred	 dollar 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	gas	tank	.
But	the	 crud 	 e 	 	oil	is	 replace 	 d 	 	with	a	 batt 	 ery 	 	.
Just	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	burn	.	It	 consum 	 es 	 	 it 	 self 	 	step	after	step	after	step	.
It	 ha 	 s 	 	2,000	life	 cycle 	 s 	 	these	 day 	 s 	 	.
And	so	it	's	sort	of	a	mini	well	.
We	 we 	 re 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	in	the	past	when	we	 b 	 ought 	 	an	electric	car	to	pay	for	the	entire	well	,	for	the	life	of	the	car	.
 No 	 body 	 	 want 	 s 	 	to	buy	a	mini	well	when	they	buy	a	car	.
In	a	sense	what	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	is	we	've	 create 	 d 	 	a	new	 consum 	 able 	 	.
You	,	 to 	 day 	 	,	buy	 gas 	 o 	 line 	 	 mile 	 s 	 	.
And	we	 create 	 d 	 	electric	 mile 	 s 	 	.
And	the	price	of	electric	 mile 	 s 	 	 end 	 s 	 	up	 be 	 ing 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	number	.
 To 	 day 	 	2010	,	in	volume	,	when	we	come	to	market	,	it	is	eight	 cent 	 s 	 	a	mile	.
 T 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	have	a	hard	time	 calcul 	 ating 	 	what	that	 mean 	 s 	 	--	in	the	average	consumer	environment	we	're	in	in	the	 U. 	 S 	 	.
20	 mile 	 s 	 	per	gallon	that	's	a	buck	50	,	a	buck	60	a	gallon	.
That	's	 cheap 	 er 	 	than	 to 	 day 	 	's	 gas 	 o 	 line 	 	,	even	in	the	 U. 	 S 	 	.
In	 Euro 	 pe 	 	where	 tax 	 es 	 	are	in	place	,	that	's	the	 equi 	 valent 	 	to	a	minus	60	dollar	barrel	.
But	 e 	 - 	 mile 	 s 	 	follow	 Mo 	 ore 	 	's	Law	.
 The 	 y 	 	go	from	eight	 cent 	 s 	 	a	mile	in	2010	,	to	four	 cent 	 s 	 	a	mile	in	2015	,	to	two	 cent 	 s 	 	a	mile	by	2020	.
Why	?	 Be 	 cause 	 	 batt 	 eries 	 	life	cycle	improve	--	a	bit	of	 improve 	 ment 	 	on	energy	density	,	which	 reduc 	 es 	 	the	price	.
And	these	 price 	 s 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	with	clean	 electron 	 s 	 	.
We	do	not	use	any	 electron 	 s 	 	that	come	from	coal	.
So	in	a	sense	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	absolute	 zero 	 - 	 carbon 	 	,	 zero 	 - 	 fossil 	 	fuel	electric	mile	at	two	 cent 	 s 	 	a	mile	by	2020	.
 N 	 ow 	 	even	if	we	get	to	40	 mile 	 s 	 	per	gallon	by	2020	,	which	is	our	 desir 	 e 	 	.
 Imagin 	 e 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	40	 mile 	 s 	 	per	gallon	 car 	 s 	 	would	be	on	the	road	.
That	is	an	80	cent	gallon	.
An	80	cent	gallon	 mean 	 s 	 	,	if	the	entire	Pacific	would	convert	to	 crud 	 e 	 	oil	,	and	we	'd	let	any	oil	company	 br 	 ing 	 	it	out	and	refine	it	,	they	still	ca	n't	compete	with	two	 cent 	 s 	 	a	mile	.
That	's	a	new	economic	factor	,	which	is	 fasci 	 nating 	 	to	most	people	.
 N 	 ow 	 	 th 	 is 	 	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	paper	.
That	's	how	I	 solve 	 d 	 	it	in	my	head	.	It	was	a	white	paper	I	 hand 	 ed 	 	out	to	 government 	 s 	 	.
And	some	 government 	 s 	 	told	me	that	it	's	 fasci 	 nating 	 	that	the	 young 	 er 	 	generation	 actual 	 ly 	 	 think 	 s 	 	about	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 Un 	 til 	 	I	got	to	the	true	young	global	 lead 	 er 	 	,	 Shi 	 mon 	 	 Per 	 es 	 	,	 P 	 resident 	 	of	Israel	,	and	he	ran	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 manipul 	 ation 	 	on	me	.
First	he	let	me	go	to	the	prime	 mini 	 ster 	 	of	the	country	,	who	told	me	,	if	you	can	find	the	money	you	need	for	 th 	 is 	 	network	,	200	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	and	if	you	can	find	a	car	company	that	will	build	that	car	in	mass	volume	,	in	two	million	 car 	 s 	 	--	that	's	what	we	 need 	 ed 	 	in	Israel	--	I	'll	give	you	country	to	invest	the	200	million	 in 	 to 	 	.
 Per 	 es 	 	thought	that	was	a	great	idea	.
So	we	went	out	,	and	we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	all	the	car	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	.
We	 s 	 ent 	 	 letter 	 s 	 	to	all	the	car	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	.
Three	of	them	never	 show 	 ed 	 	up	.	One	of	them	 ask 	 ed 	 	us	if	we	would	stay	with	 hybrid 	 s 	 	and	they	would	give	us	a	 dis 	 count 	 	.
But	one	of	them	 Carl 	 os 	 	Ghosn	,	CEO	of	 Ren 	 ault 	 	and	Nissan	,	when	 ask 	 ed 	 	about	 hybrid 	 s 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 fasci 	 nating 	 	.
He	 s 	 aid 	 	 hybrid 	 s 	 	are	like	 mer 	 maid 	 s 	 	.
When	you	want	a	fish	you	get	a	woman	and	when	you	need	a	woman	you	get	a	fish	.
And	Ghosn	came	up	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	I	have	the	car	,	 Mr 	 . 	 	 Per 	 es 	 	;	I	will	build	you	the	 car 	 s 	 	.	''
And	 actual 	 ly 	 	true	to	form	,	 Ren 	 ault 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	put	a	billion	and	a	half	 dollar 	 s 	 	in	building	nine	different	 type 	 s 	 	of	 car 	 s 	 	that	fit	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	model	that	will	come	 in 	 to 	 	the	market	in	mass	volume	--	mass	volume	 be 	 ing 	 	the	first	year	,	100	thousand	 car 	 s 	 	.
It	's	the	first	 mass 	 - 	 volume 	 	electric	car	,	 zero 	 - 	 e 	 mission 	 	electric	car	in	the	market	.
I	was	running	,	 a 	 s 	 	Chris	 s 	 aid 	 	,	to	be	the	CEO	of	a	large	 soft 	 ware 	 	company	 call 	 ed 	 	 SA 	 P 	 	And	then	 Per 	 es 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Well	wo	n't	you	run	 th 	 is 	 	project	?	''
And	I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	I	'm	ready	for	CEO	''	And	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Oh	no	no	no	no	no	.	You	've	got	to	explain	to	me	,	what	is	more	 import 	 ant 	 	than	saving	your	country	and	saving	the	world	,	that	you	would	go	and	do	?	''
And	I	had	to	quit	and	come	and	do	 th 	 is 	 	thing	 call 	 ed 	 	A	Better	Place	.
We	then	 decide 	 d 	 	to	scale	it	up	.
We	went	to	other	 count 	 ries 	 	.	 A 	 s 	 	I	 s 	 aid 	 	we	went	to	 Den 	 mark 	 	.
And	 Den 	 mark 	 	set	 th 	 is 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	policy	;	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 I 	 Q 	 	test	.
It	's	 in 	 verse 	 ly 	 	 proportion 	 al 	 	to	 tax 	 es 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	put	180	percent	tax	on	 gas 	 o 	 line 	 	 car 	 s 	 	and	zero	tax	on	 zero 	 - 	 e 	 mission 	 	 car 	 s 	 	.
So	if	you	want	to	buy	a	 gas 	 o 	 line 	 	car	in	 Den 	 mark 	 	,	it	 cost 	 s 	 	you	about	60,000	 Euro 	 s 	 	.
If	you	buy	our	car	it	's	about	20,000	 Euro 	 s 	 	.
If	you	fail	the	 I 	 Q 	 	test	they	ask	you	to	 leav 	 e 	 	the	country	.
We	then	 we 	 re 	 	sort	of	 co 	 in 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 guy 	 s 	 	who	run	 on 	 ly 	 	in	small	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	.
I	know	most	people	do	n't	think	of	Israel	 a 	 s 	 	a	small	 is 	 land 	 	,	but	Israel	is	an	 is 	 land 	 	--	it	's	a	 transport 	 ation 	 	 is 	 land 	 	.
If	your	car	is	 driv 	 ing 	 	 out 	 side 	 	Israel	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 stole 	 n 	 	.
If	you	're	 think 	 ing 	 	about	it	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	,	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	go	to	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 is 	 land 	 	that	we	could	find	,	and	that	was	Australia	.	The	third	country	we	 announce 	 d 	 	was	Australia	.
It	's	got	three	 center 	 s 	 	--	in	Brisbane	,	in	 Mel 	 bourne 	 	,	in	Sydney	--	and	one	 free 	 way 	 	,	one	electric	 free 	 way 	 	that	 connect 	 s 	 	them	.
The	next	 is 	 land 	 	was	not	too	hard	to	find	,	and	that	was	 Hawa 	 ii 	 	.
We	 decide 	 d 	 	to	come	 in 	 to 	 	the	 U. 	 S 	 	.
and	pick	the	two	best	 place 	 s 	 	--	the	one	where	you	did	n't	need	any	range	 extens 	 ion 	 	.
 Hawa 	 ii 	 	you	can	drive	around	the	 is 	 land 	 	on	one	 batt 	 ery 	 	.
And	if	you	 re 	 ally 	 	have	a	long	day	you	can	 s 	 witch 	 	,	and	keep	on	 driv 	 ing 	 	around	the	 is 	 land 	 	.
The	second	one	was	the	San	 Francis 	 co 	 	Bay	Area	where	 Ga 	 vin 	 	 New 	 som 	 	 create 	 d 	 	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	policy	 a 	 cross 	 	all	the	 mayor 	 s 	 	.
He	 decide 	 d 	 	that	he	's	going	to	take	over	the	state	,	 un 	 official 	 ly 	 	,	and	then	 official 	 ly 	 	,	and	then	 create 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 Reg 	 ion 	 	One	policy	.
In	the	San	 Francis 	 co 	 	Bay	Area	not	 on 	 ly 	 	do	you	have	the	highest	 concent 	 ration 	 	of	 Prius 	 es 	 	,	but	you	 al 	 so 	 	have	the	perfect	range	 extend 	 er 	 	.
It	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	other	car	.
 A 	 s 	 	we	 star 	 ed 	 	 scal 	 ing 	 	it	up	we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	what	is	the	problem	to	come	up	to	the	U.S.	?
Why	is	 th 	 is 	 	a	big	issue	?
And	the	most	 fasci 	 nating 	 	thing	we	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	is	that	,	when	you	have	small	 problem 	 s 	 	on	the	individual	level	,	like	the	price	of	 gas 	 o 	 line 	 	to	drive	every	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
You	do	n't	notice	it	,	but	when	the	 aggreg 	 ate 	 	 come 	 s 	 	up	you	're	dead	.	 Al 	 right 	 	?
So	the	price	of	oil	,	much	like	 lot 	 s 	 	of	other	 curv 	 es 	 	that	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	,	 go 	 es 	 	 a 	 long 	 	a	 deple 	 tion 	 	 curv 	 e 	 	.
The	 found 	 ation 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 curv 	 e 	 	is	that	we	keep	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	the	 well 	 s 	 	that	are	close	to	the	ground	.
And	we	keep	 get 	 ting 	 	 well 	 s 	 	that	are	 far 	 ther 	 	away	from	the	ground	.
It	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	more	and	more	and	more	expensive	to	dig	them	out	.
You	think	,	well	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	up	,	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	down	,	 it 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	up	,	it	's	going	to	keep	on	going	up	and	down	.
 He 	 re 	 	is	the	problem	:	at	147	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	barrel	,	which	we	 we 	 re 	 	in	six	 month 	 s 	 	ago	,	the	U.S.	 s 	 pent 	 	a	ton	of	money	to	get	oil	.
 Th 	 en 	 	we	lost	our	 eco 	 nomy 	 	and	we	went	back	down	to	47	--	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	it	's	40	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	it	's	50	.
 N 	 ow 	 	we	're	running	a	 stimul 	 us 	 	package	.
It	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 trillion 	 - 	 dollar 	 	 stimul 	 us 	 	package	.
We	're	going	to	 rev 	 ive 	 	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.	 Hop 	 e 	 fully 	 	it	 happen 	 s 	 	between	now	and	2015	,	 some 	 where 	 	in	that	space	.
What	 happen 	 s 	 	when	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	 re 	 cover 	 s 	 	?
By	2015	we	would	have	had	at	 l 	 east 	 	250	million	new	 car 	 s 	 	even	at	the	pace	we	're	going	at	right	now	.
That	's	 an 	 other 	 	30	percent	demand	on	oil	.
That	is	 an 	 other 	 	25	million	 barrel 	 s 	 	a	day	.
That	's	all	the	U.S.	 us 	 age 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
In	other	 word 	 s 	 	at	some	point	when	we	've	 re 	 cover 	 ed 	 	we	go	up	to	the	peak	.
And	then	we	do	the	OPEC	 stimul 	 us 	 	package	 al 	 so 	 	known	 a 	 s 	 	200	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	barrel	.
We	take	our	money	and	we	give	it	away	.
You	know	what	 happen 	 s 	 	at	that	point	?
We	go	back	down	.	It	's	going	to	go	up	and	down	.
And	the	 down 	 s 	 	are	going	to	be	much	 long 	 er 	 	and	the	 up 	 s 	 	are	going	to	be	much	 short 	 er 	 	.
And	that	's	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	 problem 	 s 	 	that	are	additive	,	like	CO2	,	which	we	go	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	up	and	then	we	tip	,	and	 problem 	 s 	 	that	are	 deple 	 t 	 ive 	 	,	in	which	we	lose	what	we	have	,	which	 oscill 	 ate 	 	,	and	they	 oscill 	 ate 	 	 un 	 til 	 	we	lose	 every 	 thing 	 	we	've	got	.
 N 	 ow 	 	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	at	what	the	answer	would	be	.
Right	?	 Re 	 member 	 	in	the	campaign	:	one	million	hybrid	 car 	 s 	 	by	2015	.
That	is	0.5	percent	of	the	U.S.	oil	consumption	.
That	is	oh	point	oh	well	percent	of	the	rest	of	the	world	.
That	wo	n't	do	much	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
We	 look 	 ed 	 	at	an	 MI 	 T 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	:	ten	million	electric	 car 	 s 	 	on	the	global	 road 	 s 	 	.
Ten	million	out	of	500	million	we	will	add	between	now	and	then	.
That	is	the	most	 pessim 	 istic 	 	number	you	can	have	.
It	's	 al 	 so 	 	the	most	 optimist 	 ic 	 	number	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 mean 	 s 	 	we	will	scale	 th 	 is 	 	industry	from	100	thousand	 car 	 s 	 	is	2011	,	to	10	million	 car 	 s 	 	by	2016	--	100	x	growth	in	less	than	five	 year 	 s 	 	.
You	have	to	remember	that	the	world	 to 	 day 	 	is	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	in	so	 man 	 y 	 	 car 	 s 	 	.
We	have	10	million	 car 	 s 	 	by	region	.
That	's	an	enormous	amount	of	 car 	 s 	 	.
China	is	 add 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 car 	 s 	 	--	India	,	Russia	,	Brazil	.
We	have	all	these	 region 	 s 	 	.
 Euro 	 pe 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 solve 	 d 	 	it	.	 The 	 y 	 	just	put	a	tax	on	 gas 	 o 	 line 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	'll	be	the	first	in	line	to	get	off	 be 	 cause 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 price 	 s 	 	are	high	.
China	 solve 	 s 	 	it	by	an	 e 	 dict 	 	.	At	some	point	they	'll	just	declare	that	no	 gas 	 o 	 line 	 	car	will	come	 in 	 to 	 	a	city	,	and	that	will	be	it	.
The	 Indian 	 s 	 	do	n't	even	understand	why	we	think	of	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	problem	 be 	 cause 	 	most	people	in	India	fill	two	or	three	 gallon 	 s 	 	every	time	.
For	them	to	get	a	 batt 	 ery 	 	that	 go 	 es 	 	120	 mile 	 s 	 	is	an	 extens 	 ion 	 	on	range	,	not	a	 r 	 eduction 	 	in	range	.
We	're	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 one 	 s 	 	who	do	n't	have	the	price	set	right	.
We	do	n't	have	the	industry	set	right	.
We	do	n't	have	any	incentive	to	go	and	 re 	 solve 	 	it	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 U. 	 S 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	where	is	the	car	industry	on	that	?
 Ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.	The	car	industry	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	focused	just	on	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	at	it	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Car	1.0	we	'll	solve	 every 	 thing 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	car	 it 	 self 	 	.	''
No	 infra 	 structure 	 	,	no	problem	.
We	 for 	 got 	 	about	the	entire	chain	around	us	.
All	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	that	 happen 	 s 	 	around	.
We	are	looking	at	the	emergence	of	a	car	2.0	--	a	whole	new	market	,	a	whole	new	business	model	.
The	business	model	in	which	the	money	that	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	coming	in	,	to	drive	the	car	--	the	 minute 	 s 	 	,	the	 mile 	 s 	 	if	you	want	,	that	you	are	all	familiar	with	--	subsidize	the	price	of	the	car	,	just	like	 cell 	 phone 	 s 	 	.	You	'll	pay	for	the	 mile 	 s 	 	.
And	some	of	it	will	go	back	to	the	car	maker	.
Some	of	it	will	go	back	to	your	own	pocket	.
But	our	 car 	 s 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	going	to	be	 cheap 	 er 	 	than	 gas 	 o 	 line 	 	 car 	 s 	 	.
You	're	looking	at	a	world	where	 car 	 s 	 	are	 match 	 ed 	 	with	 wind 	 mill 	 s 	 	.
In	 Den 	 mark 	 	,	we	will	drive	all	the	 car 	 s 	 	in	 Den 	 mark 	 	from	 wind 	 mill 	 s 	 	,	not	from	oil	.
In	Israel	,	we	've	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	put	a	solar	farm	in	the	south	of	Israel	.
And	people	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Oh	that	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	large	space	that	you	're	 ask 	 ing 	 	for	.	''
And	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	What	if	we	had	proven	that	in	the	same	space	we	found	oil	for	the	country	for	the	next	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	?	''
And	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	We	 tri 	 ed 	 	.	There	is	n't	any	.	''
We	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	No	no	,	but	what	if	we	prove	it	?	''
And	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Well	you	can	dig	.	''	And	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	dig	up	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 dig 	 ging 	 	down	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	perfect	 match 	 es 	 	to	one	 an 	 other 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	all	you	need	is	about	10	percent	of	the	 electric 	 ity 	 	generated	.
Think	of	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	project	that	 span 	 s 	 	over	about	10	 year 	 s 	 	.
That	's	one	percent	a	year	.
 N 	 ow 	 	when	we	're	looking	at	solving	big	 problem 	 s 	 	,	we	need	to	start	 think 	 ing 	 	in	two	 number 	 s 	 	.
And	 t 	 hose 	 	are	not	20	percent	by	2020	.
The	two	 number 	 s 	 	are	zero	--	 a 	 s 	 	in	zero	 foot 	 print 	 	or	zero	oil	--	and	scale	it	 in 	 fin 	 ity 	 	.
And	when	we	go	to	 CO 	 P 	 15 	 	at	the	end	of	 th 	 is 	 	year	we	ca	n't	stop	 think 	 ing 	 	of	 padd 	 ing 	 	CO2	.
We	have	to	start	 think 	 ing 	 	about	giving	 kick 	 ers 	 	to	 count 	 ries 	 	that	are	 will 	 ing 	 	to	go	to	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	scale	.
One	car	 emit 	 s 	 	four	 ton 	 s 	 	.
And	 actual 	 ly 	 	700	and	change	million	 car 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	emit	2.8	billion	 ton 	 s 	 	of	CO2	.
That	's	,	in	the	additive	,	about	25	percent	of	our	problem	.
 Car 	 s 	 	and	 truck 	 s 	 	add	up	to	about	25	percent	of	the	world	's	CO2	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	.
We	have	to	come	and	attack	 th 	 is 	 	problem	with	a	focus	,	with	an	effort	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	we	're	going	to	go	to	zero	before	the	world	 end 	 s 	 	.
I	 actual 	 ly 	 	 share 	 d 	 	that	with	some	 legisl 	 ators 	 	here	in	the	 U. 	 S 	 	.
I	 share 	 d 	 	it	with	a	 gentle 	 man 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 Bob 	 by 	 	 Ken 	 ned 	 y 	 	 Jr 	 . 	 	,	who	is	one	of	my	 idol 	 s 	 	.
I	told	him	one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	that	his	uncle	was	 remember 	 ed 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 s 	 aid 	 	we	're	going	to	 s 	 end 	 	a	man	to	the	moon	,	and	we	'll	do	it	by	the	end	of	the	decade	.
We	did	n't	say	we	're	going	to	 s 	 end 	 	a	man	20	percent	to	the	moon	.
And	there	will	be	about	a	20	percent	chance	we	'll	 re 	 cover 	 	him	.
He	 actual 	 ly 	 	 share 	 d 	 	with	me	 an 	 other 	 	story	,	which	is	from	about	200	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
200	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	in	Parliament	,	in	Great	 Brit 	 ain 	 	,	there	was	a	long	argument	over	 eco 	 nomy 	 	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	 moral 	 ity 	 	.
25	percent	--	just	like	25	percent	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	 come 	 s 	 	from	 car 	 s 	 	--	25	percent	of	 the 	 ir 	 	energy	for	the	entire	industrial	world	in	the	 U. 	 K 	 	.
came	from	a	source	of	energy	that	was	immoral	:	human	 slave 	 s 	 	.
And	there	was	an	argument	.	Should	we	stop	using	 slave 	 s 	 	?
And	what	would	it	do	to	our	 eco 	 nomy 	 	?
And	people	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Well	we	need	to	take	time	to	do	it	.
Let	's	not	do	it	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	.	 May 	 be 	 	we	free	the	 kid 	 s 	 	and	keep	the	 slave 	 s 	 	.
And	after	a	month	of	 argument 	 s 	 	they	 decide 	 d 	 	to	stop	 slave 	 ry 	 	,	and	the	industrial	revolution	 start 	 ed 	 	 with 	 in 	 	less	than	one	year	.
And	the	 U. 	 K. 	 	had	100	 year 	 s 	 	of	economic	growth	.
We	have	to	make	the	right	moral	decision	.
We	have	to	make	it	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	.
We	need	to	have	 p 	 resident 	 ial 	 	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	just	like	we	had	in	Israel	that	 s 	 aid 	 	we	will	end	oil	.
And	we	need	to	do	it	not	 with 	 in 	 	20	 year 	 s 	 	or	50	 year 	 s 	 	,	but	 with 	 in 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 p 	 resident 	 ial 	 	term	 be 	 cause 	 	if	we	do	n't	,	we	will	lose	our	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	right	after	we	'd	lost	our	 moral 	 ity 	 	.
Thank	you	all	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
Thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	,	Chris	.	 Every 	 body 	 	who	came	up	here	 s 	 aid 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 scar 	 ed 	 	.	I	do	n't	know	if	I	'm	 scar 	 ed 	 	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	first	time	of	 address 	 ing 	 	an	audience	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
And	I	do	n't	have	any	smart	technology	for	you	to	look	at	.
There	are	no	 slide 	 s 	 	,	so	you	'll	just	have	to	be	content	with	me	.
What	I	want	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	is	share	with	you	a	couple	of	 st 	 ories 	 	and	talk	about	a	different	 Afri 	 ca 	 	.
 Al 	 ready 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	there	 we 	 re 	 	some	 all 	 usion 	 s 	 	to	the	 Afri 	 ca 	 	that	you	hear	about	all	the	time	:	the	 Afri 	 ca 	 	of	 HIV 	 / 	 AIDS 	 	,	the	 Afri 	 ca 	 	of	malaria	,	the	 Afri 	 ca 	 	of	poverty	,	the	 Afri 	 ca 	 	of	conflict	,	and	the	 Afri 	 ca 	 	of	 disaster 	 s 	 	.
 Whi 	 le 	 	it	is	true	that	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	are	going	on	,	there	's	an	 Afri 	 ca 	 	that	you	do	n't	hear	about	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
And	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	I	'm	 puzzl 	 ed 	 	,	and	I	ask	 my 	 self 	 	why	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	 Afri 	 ca 	 	that	is	changing	,	that	Chris	 allud 	 ed 	 	to	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	 Afri 	 ca 	 	of	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	 Afri 	 ca 	 	where	people	want	to	take	charge	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 future 	 s 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 de 	 s 	 tin 	 ies 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 Afri 	 ca 	 	where	people	are	looking	for	 partner 	 ship 	 s 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.	That	's	what	I	want	to	talk	about	 to 	 day 	 	.
And	I	want	to	start	by	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	a	story	about	that	change	in	 Afri 	 ca 	 	.
On	15th	of	September	2005	,	 Mr 	 . 	 	 Diepr 	 eye 	 	 Al 	 amieyeseigha 	 	,	a	 govern 	 or 	 	of	one	of	the	 oil 	 - 	 rich 	 	 state 	 s 	 	of	 Niger 	 ia 	 	,	was	 arrest 	 ed 	 	by	the	London	 Metro 	 politan 	 	 Poli 	 ce 	 	on	a	visit	to	London	.
He	was	 arrest 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	there	 we 	 re 	 	 transfer 	 s 	 	of	eight	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	that	went	 in 	 to 	 	some	 dorm 	 ant 	 	 account 	 s 	 	that	 belong 	 ed 	 	to	him	and	his	family	.
 Th 	 is 	 	arrest	 occur 	 red 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	there	was	 co 	 operation 	 	between	the	London	 Metro 	 politan 	 	 Poli 	 ce 	 	and	the	 Eco 	 nomic 	 	and	Financial	 Crime 	 s 	 	 Com 	 mission 	 	of	 Niger 	 ia 	 	--	led	by	one	of	our	most	able	and	 courage 	 ous 	 	people	:	 Mr 	 . 	 	 Nu 	 hu 	 	Ribadu	.
 Al 	 amieyeseigha 	 	was	 arra 	 ign 	 ed 	 	in	London	.
 Du 	 e 	 	to	some	 slip 	 - 	 up 	 s 	 	,	he	 manage 	 d 	 	to	 es 	 cape 	 	 dress 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	woman	and	ran	from	London	back	to	 Niger 	 ia 	 	where	,	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	our	 constit 	 ution 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	in	 off 	 ice 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 govern 	 ors 	 	,	 p 	 resident 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	in	 man 	 y 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	--	have	 immun 	 ity 	 	and	can	not	be	 prosecut 	 ed 	 	.	But	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	:	people	 we 	 re 	 	so	 out 	 rag 	 ed 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	behavior	that	it	was	possible	for	his	state	 legisl 	 ature 	 	to	 im 	 peach 	 	him	and	get	him	out	of	 off 	 ice 	 	.
 To 	 day 	 	,	 Al 	 am 	 s 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	we	call	him	for	short	--	is	in	jail	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	story	about	the	fact	that	people	in	 Afri 	 ca 	 	are	no	 long 	 er 	 	 will 	 ing 	 	to	 toler 	 ate 	 	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	from	 the 	 ir 	 	 lead 	 ers 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	story	about	the	fact	that	people	want	 the 	 ir 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	 manage 	 d 	 	 proper 	 ly 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	good	,	and	not	taken	out	to	 place 	 s 	 	where	they	'll	benefit	just	a	few	of	the	elite	.
And	 there 	 fore 	 	,	when	you	hear	about	the	corrupt	 Afri 	 ca 	 	--	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	all	the	time	--	I	want	you	to	know	that	the	people	and	the	 government 	 s 	 	are	 try 	 ing 	 	hard	to	fight	 th 	 is 	 	in	some	of	the	 count 	 ries 	 	,	and	that	some	 success 	 es 	 	are	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	.
 Do 	 es 	 	it	mean	the	problem	is	over	?	The	answer	is	no	.
There	's	still	a	long	way	to	go	,	but	that	there	's	a	will	there	.
And	that	 success 	 es 	 	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 chalk 	 ed 	 	up	on	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	fight	.
So	when	you	hear	about	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	,	do	n't	just	feel	that	 noth 	 ing 	 	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 d 	 one 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	--	that	you	ca	n't	 oper 	 ate 	 	in	any	African	country	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 overwhelm 	 ing 	 	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	.	That	is	not	the	case	.
There	's	a	will	to	fight	,	and	in	 man 	 y 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	,	that	fight	is	 on 	 going 	 	and	is	 be 	 ing 	 	won	.	In	 other 	 s 	 	,	like	mine	,	where	there	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	long	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 dictator 	 ship 	 	in	 Niger 	 ia 	 	,	the	fight	is	 on 	 going 	 	and	we	have	a	long	way	to	go	.
But	the	truth	of	the	matter	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	on	.
The	 result 	 s 	 	are	 show 	 ing 	 	:	 in 	 dependent 	 	 monitor 	 ing 	 	by	the	World	Bank	and	other	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	show	that	in	 man 	 y 	 	 in 	 stance 	 s 	 	the	trend	is	 down 	 ward 	 s 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	,	and	 govern 	 ance 	 	is	 improv 	 ing 	 	.
A	 stud 	 y 	 	by	the	 Eco 	 nomic 	 	 Com 	 mission 	 	for	 Afri 	 ca 	 	 show 	 ed 	 	a	clear	trend	 up 	 ward 	 s 	 	in	 govern 	 ance 	 	in	28	African	 count 	 ries 	 	.
And	let	me	say	just	one	more	thing	before	I	 leav 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	area	of	 govern 	 ance 	 	.
That	is	that	people	talk	about	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	,	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	.
All	the	time	when	they	talk	about	it	you	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	think	about	 Afri 	 ca 	 	.
That	's	the	image	:	African	 count 	 ries 	 	.	But	let	me	say	 th 	 is 	 	:	if	 Al 	 am 	 s 	 	was	able	to	export	eight	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	an	account	in	London	--	if	the	other	people	who	had	taken	money	,	 estimate 	 d 	 	at	20	to	40	billion	now	of	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	'	 mon 	 ies 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	 a 	 broad 	 	in	the	 develop 	 ed 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	--	if	they	're	able	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	what	is	that	?	 I 	 s 	 	that	not	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	?
In	 th 	 is 	 	country	,	if	you	 receiv 	 e 	 	 stole 	 n 	 	 good 	 s 	 	,	are	you	not	 prosecut 	 ed 	 	?
So	when	we	talk	about	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	,	let	us	 al 	 so 	 	think	about	what	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	on	the	other	side	of	the	 glob 	 e 	 	--	where	the	money	's	going	and	what	can	be	 d 	 one 	 	to	stop	it	.
I	'm	 work 	 ing 	 	on	an	 initi 	 ative 	 	now	,	 a 	 long 	 	with	the	World	Bank	,	on	asset	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	what	we	can	to	get	the	 mon 	 ies 	 	that	have	 be 	 en 	 	taken	 a 	 broad 	 	--	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	'	 money 	 s 	 	--	to	get	that	 s 	 ent 	 	back	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	if	we	can	get	the	20	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	out	there	back	,	it	may	be	far	more	for	some	of	these	 count 	 ries 	 	than	all	the	aid	that	is	 be 	 ing 	 	put	together	.
The	second	thing	I	want	to	talk	about	is	the	will	for	reform	.
 African 	 s 	 	,	after	--	they	're	 tire 	 d 	 	,	we	're	 tire 	 d 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	the	subject	of	 every 	 body 	 	's	 char 	 ity 	 	and	care	.
We	are	 grat 	 e 	 ful 	 	,	but	we	know	that	we	can	take	charge	of	our	own	 de 	 s 	 tin 	 ies 	 	if	we	have	the	will	to	reform	.
And	what	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	 man 	 y 	 	African	 count 	 ries 	 	now	is	a	 real 	 ization 	 	that	no	one	can	do	it	but	us	.	We	have	to	do	it	.
We	can	 invit 	 e 	 	 partner 	 s 	 	who	can	support	us	,	but	we	have	to	start	.
We	have	to	reform	our	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	,	change	our	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	,	 be 	 come 	 	more	 democrat 	 ic 	 	,	be	more	open	to	change	and	to	information	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	 start 	 ed 	 	to	do	in	one	of	the	largest	 count 	 ries 	 	on	the	continent	,	 Niger 	 ia 	 	.
In	fact	,	if	you	're	not	in	 Niger 	 ia 	 	,	you	're	not	in	 Afri 	 ca 	 	.
I	want	to	tell	you	that	.
One	in	four	 sub 	 - 	 Saharan 	 	 African 	 s 	 	is	 Niger 	 ian 	 	,	and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	140	million	dynamic	people	--	chaotic	people	--	but	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	people	.	You	'll	never	be	 bor 	 ed 	 	.
What	we	 start 	 ed 	 	to	do	was	to	 real 	 ize 	 	that	we	had	to	take	charge	and	reform	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
And	with	the	support	of	a	 lead 	 er 	 	who	was	 will 	 ing 	 	,	at	the	time	,	to	do	the	 reform 	 s 	 	,	we	put	forward	a	 comprehens 	 ive 	 	reform	program	,	which	we	 develop 	 ed 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
Not	the	 Inter 	 national 	 	 Mon 	 et 	 ary 	 	Fund	.	Not	the	World	Bank	,	where	I	 work 	 ed 	 	for	21	 year 	 s 	 	and	rose	to	be	a	vice	 p 	 resident 	 	.
No	one	can	do	it	for	you	.	You	have	to	do	it	for	 your 	 self 	 	.
We	put	together	a	program	that	would	,	one	:	get	the	state	out	of	 business 	 es 	 	it	had	 noth 	 ing 	 	--	it	had	no	business	 be 	 ing 	 	in	.
The	state	should	not	be	in	the	business	of	producing	 good 	 s 	 	and	 service 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 in 	 efficient 	 	and	 in 	 compete 	 nt 	 	.
So	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	 privat 	 ize 	 	 man 	 y 	 	of	our	 enterprise 	 s 	 	.
We	--	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	,	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	 liberal 	 ize 	 	 man 	 y 	 	of	our	 market 	 s 	 	.
Can	you	 believ 	 e 	 	that	prior	to	 th 	 is 	 	reform	--	which	 start 	 ed 	 	at	the	end	of	2003	,	when	I	left	 Wash 	 ington 	 	to	go	and	take	up	the	post	of	 Fin 	 ance 	 	 Mini 	 ster 	 	--	we	had	a	 tele 	 communication 	 s 	 	company	that	was	 on 	 ly 	 	able	to	develop	4,500	 land 	 lines 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	entire	30-year	 histo 	 ry 	 	?
 Hav 	 ing 	 	a	 tele 	 phone 	 	in	my	country	was	a	huge	 luxur 	 y 	 	.
You	could	n't	get	it	.	You	had	to	bribe	.
You	had	to	do	 every 	 thing 	 	to	get	your	phone	.
When	 P 	 resident 	 	 Ob 	 asanjo 	 	 support 	 ed 	 	and	 launch 	 ed 	 	the	 liberal 	 ization 	 	of	the	 tele 	 communication 	 s 	 	sector	,	we	went	from	4,500	 land 	 lines 	 	to	32	million	 G 	 SM 	 	lines	,	and	 count 	 ing 	 	.
 Niger 	 ia 	 	's	 tele 	 com 	 s 	 	market	is	the	 second 	 - 	 fast 	 est 	 	growing	in	the	world	,	after	China	.	We	are	 get 	 ting 	 	 invest 	 ments 	 	of	about	a	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	year	in	 tele 	 com 	 s 	 	.	And	 no 	 body 	 	 know 	 s 	 	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	a	few	smart	people	.
The	 smart 	 est 	 	one	,	first	to	come	in	,	was	the	 MT 	 N 	 	company	of	South	 Afri 	 ca 	 	.
And	in	the	three	 year 	 s 	 	that	I	was	 Fin 	 ance 	 	 Mini 	 ster 	 	,	they	made	an	average	of	360	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	profit	per	year	.
360	million	in	a	market	--	in	a	country	that	is	a	poor	country	,	with	an	average	per	capita	income	just	under	500	 dollar 	 s 	 	per	capita	.
So	the	market	is	there	.
When	they	 ke 	 pt 	 	 th 	 is 	 	under	 wrap 	 s 	 	,	but	soon	 other 	 s 	 	got	to	know	.
 Niger 	 ians 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	to	develop	some	 wire 	 less 	 	 tele 	 communication 	 s 	 	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	,	and	three	or	four	 other 	 s 	 	have	come	in	.
But	there	's	a	huge	market	out	there	,	and	people	do	n't	know	about	it	,	or	they	do	n't	want	to	know	.
So	 privat 	 ization 	 	is	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	.
The	other	thing	we	've	 al 	 so 	 	 d 	 one 	 	is	to	manage	our	 finance 	 s 	 	better	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	 no 	 body 	 	's	going	to	help	you	and	support	you	if	you	're	not	 man 	 aging 	 	your	own	 finance 	 s 	 	well	.
And	 Niger 	 ia 	 	,	with	the	oil	sector	,	had	the	reputation	of	 be 	 ing 	 	corrupt	and	not	 man 	 aging 	 	 it 	 s 	 	own	public	 finance 	 s 	 	well	.
So	what	did	we	try	to	do	?	We	 introduc 	 ed 	 	a	 fisc 	 al 	 	rule	that	 de 	 - 	 linked 	 	our	budget	from	the	oil	price	.
 Be 	 fore 	 	we	used	to	just	budget	on	 what 	 ever 	 	oil	we	 br 	 ing 	 	in	,	 be 	 cause 	 	oil	is	the	 big 	 gest 	 	,	most	 revenue 	 - 	 earn 	 ing 	 	sector	in	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	:	70	percent	of	our	 revenue 	 s 	 	come	from	oil	.
We	 de 	 - 	 linked 	 	that	,	and	once	we	did	it	,	we	 beg 	 an 	 	to	budget	at	a	price	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	lower	than	the	oil	price	and	 s 	 ave 	 	 what 	 ever 	 	was	above	that	price	.
We	did	n't	know	we	could	pull	it	off	;	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	controversial	.
But	what	it	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	did	was	that	the	 volatil 	 ity 	 	that	had	 be 	 en 	 	present	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	our	economic	 develop 	 ment 	 	--	where	,	even	if	oil	 price 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	high	,	we	would	grow	 ver 	 y 	 	fast	.
When	they	 crash 	 ed 	 	,	we	 crash 	 ed 	 	.
And	we	could	 hard 	 ly 	 	even	pay	 any 	 thing 	 	,	any	 s 	 al 	 aries 	 	,	in	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
That	 smooth 	 ened 	 	out	.	We	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	 s 	 ave 	 	,	just	before	I	left	,	27	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	.	 Where 	 a 	 s 	 	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	went	to	our	 re 	 serve 	 s 	 	--	when	I	 arriv 	 ed 	 	in	2003	,	we	had	seven	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	in	 re 	 serve 	 s 	 	.
By	the	time	I	left	,	we	had	gone	up	to	 al 	 most 	 	30	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	.	And	 a 	 s 	 	we	speak	now	,	we	have	about	40	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	in	 re 	 serve 	 s 	 	due	to	proper	management	of	our	 finance 	 s 	 	.
And	that	 shore 	 s 	 	up	our	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	 make 	 s 	 	it	 s 	 table 	 	.
Our	 ex 	 change 	 	rate	that	used	to	 fluctu 	 ate 	 	all	the	time	is	now	 fair 	 ly 	 	 s 	 table 	 	and	 be 	 ing 	 	 manage 	 d 	 	so	that	business	people	have	a	 predict 	 ability 	 	of	 price 	 s 	 	in	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
We	 br 	 ought 	 	 infla 	 tion 	 	down	from	28	percent	to	about	11	percent	.
And	we	had	 G 	 DP 	 	grow	from	an	average	of	2.3	percent	the	previous	decade	to	about	6.5	percent	now	.
So	all	the	 change 	 s 	 	and	 reform 	 s 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	make	have	 show 	 n 	 	up	in	 result 	 s 	 	that	are	 measur 	 able 	 	in	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
And	what	is	more	 import 	 ant 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	want	to	get	away	from	oil	and	 divers 	 ify 	 	--	and	there	are	so	 man 	 y 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	one	big	country	,	 a 	 s 	 	in	 man 	 y 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	in	 Afri 	 ca 	 	--	what	was	 remark 	 able 	 	is	that	much	of	 th 	 is 	 	growth	came	not	from	the	oil	sector	 al 	 one 	 	,	but	from	 non 	 - 	 oil 	 	.
 Agri 	 culture 	 	grew	at	better	than	eight	percent	.
 A 	 s 	 	 tele 	 com 	 s 	 	sector	grew	,	housing	and	construction	,	and	I	could	go	on	and	on	.	And	 th 	 is 	 	is	to	 illustr 	 ate 	 	to	you	that	once	you	get	the	 macro 	 - 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	 straight 	 ened 	 	out	,	the	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	in	 vari 	 ous 	 	other	 sector 	 s 	 	are	enormous	.
We	have	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	in	 agricultur 	 e 	 	,	like	I	 s 	 aid 	 	.
We	have	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	in	solid	 mineral 	 s 	 	.	We	have	a	lot	of	 mineral 	 s 	 	that	no	one	 ha 	 s 	 	even	 invest 	 ed 	 	in	or	 explore 	 d 	 	.	And	we	 real 	 ized 	 	that	 with 	 out 	 	the	proper	 legisl 	 ation 	 	to	make	that	possible	,	that	would	n't	happen	.	So	we	've	now	got	a	 min 	 ing 	 	code	that	is	 compar 	 able 	 	with	some	of	the	best	in	the	world	.
We	have	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	in	housing	and	real	 e 	 state 	 	.
There	was	 noth 	 ing 	 	in	a	country	of	140	million	people	--	no	 shop 	 ping 	 	 mall 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	you	know	them	here	.
 Th 	 is 	 	was	an	 invest 	 ment 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	for	 some 	 one 	 	that	 excit 	 ed 	 	the	 imagin 	 ation 	 	of	people	.
And	now	,	we	have	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	in	which	the	 business 	 es 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	mall	are	 do 	 ing 	 	four	 time 	 s 	 	the	 turn 	 over 	 	that	they	had	 project 	 ed 	 	.
So	,	huge	 thing 	 s 	 	in	construction	,	real	 e 	 state 	 	,	mortgage	 market 	 s 	 	.	Financial	 service 	 s 	 	:	we	had	89	 bank 	 s 	 	.	Too	 man 	 y 	 	not	 do 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	real	business	.
We	 con 	 solid 	 ated 	 	them	from	89	to	25	 bank 	 s 	 	by	 requir 	 ing 	 	that	they	 in 	 crease 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	capital	--	share	capital	.
And	it	went	from	about	25	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	to	150	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
The	 bank 	 s 	 	--	these	 bank 	 s 	 	are	now	 con 	 solid 	 ated 	 	,	and	that	 strength 	 en 	 ing 	 	of	the	 bank 	 ing 	 	system	 ha 	 s 	 	 attract 	 ed 	 	a	lot	of	 invest 	 ment 	 	from	 out 	 side 	 	.
 Bar 	 clay 	 s 	 	Bank	of	the	 U. 	 K. 	 	is	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	in	500	million	.
Standard	 Chart 	 er 	 ed 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	in	140	million	.
And	I	can	go	on	.	 Dollar 	 s 	 	,	on	and	on	,	 in 	 to 	 	the	system	.
We	are	 do 	 ing 	 	the	same	with	the	 insur 	 ance 	 	sector	.
So	in	financial	 service 	 s 	 	,	a	great	deal	of	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.
In	 tour 	 ism 	 	,	in	 man 	 y 	 	African	 count 	 ries 	 	,	a	great	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.
And	that	's	what	 man 	 y 	 	people	know	East	 Afri 	 ca 	 	for	:	the	 wild 	 life 	 	,	the	 elephant 	 s 	 	,	and	so	on	.
But	 man 	 aging 	 	the	 tour 	 ism 	 	market	in	a	way	that	can	 re 	 ally 	 	benefit	the	people	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
So	what	am	I	 try 	 ing 	 	to	say	?	I	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	tell	you	that	there	's	a	new	wave	on	the	continent	.
A	new	wave	of	 open 	 ness 	 	and	 democrat 	 ization 	 	in	which	,	since	2000	,	more	than	 two 	 - 	 third 	 s 	 	of	African	 count 	 ries 	 	have	had	 multi 	 - 	 party 	 	 democrat 	 ic 	 	 election 	 s 	 	.
Not	all	of	them	have	 be 	 en 	 	perfect	,	or	will	be	,	but	the	trend	is	 ver 	 y 	 	clear	.
I	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	tell	you	that	since	the	past	three	 year 	 s 	 	,	the	average	rate	of	growth	on	the	continent	 ha 	 s 	 	 move 	 d 	 	from	about	2.5	percent	to	about	five	percent	per	annum	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	better	than	the	performance	of	 man 	 y 	 	 O 	 E 	 CD 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	.
So	it	's	clear	that	 thing 	 s 	 	are	changing	.
 Conflict 	 s 	 	are	down	on	the	continent	;	from	about	12	 conflict 	 s 	 	a	decade	ago	,	we	are	down	to	three	or	four	 conflict 	 s 	 	--	one	of	the	most	 terr 	 ible 	 	,	of	course	,	of	which	is	 Dar 	 fur 	 	.
And	,	you	know	,	you	have	the	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	effect	where	if	 some 	 thing 	 	is	going	on	in	one	part	of	the	continent	,	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	the	entire	continent	is	 affect 	 ed 	 	.
But	you	should	know	that	 th 	 is 	 	continent	is	not	--	is	a	continent	of	 man 	 y 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	,	not	one	country	.
And	if	we	are	down	to	three	or	four	 conflict 	 s 	 	,	it	 mean 	 s 	 	that	there	are	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	to	invest	in	 s 	 table 	 	,	growing	,	 excit 	 ing 	 	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	where	there	's	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.
And	I	want	to	just	make	one	point	about	 th 	 is 	 	 invest 	 ment 	 	.
The	best	way	to	help	 African 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	is	to	help	them	to	stand	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	feet	.
And	the	best	way	to	do	that	is	by	 help 	 ing 	 	create	 job 	 s 	 	.
There	's	no	issue	with	 fight 	 ing 	 	malaria	and	 put 	 ting 	 	money	in	that	and	saving	children	's	 live 	 s 	 	.	That	's	not	what	I	'm	 say 	 ing 	 	.	That	is	fine	.
But	imagine	the	impact	on	a	family	:	if	the	 parent 	 s 	 	can	be	 employ 	 ed 	 	and	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	 the 	 ir 	 	children	go	to	school	,	that	they	can	buy	the	 drug 	 s 	 	to	fight	the	disease	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
If	we	can	invest	in	 place 	 s 	 	where	you	 your 	 s 	 elves 	 	make	money	whilst	creating	 job 	 s 	 	and	 help 	 ing 	 	people	stand	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	feet	,	is	n't	that	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	?	 I 	 s 	 	n't	that	the	way	to	go	?
And	I	want	to	say	that	some	of	the	best	people	to	invest	in	on	the	continent	are	the	women	.
I	have	a	CD	here	.	I	'm	sorry	that	I	did	n't	say	 any 	 thing 	 	on	time	.
 Other 	 wise 	 	,	I	would	have	 like 	 d 	 	you	to	have	 s 	 een 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
It	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 Afri 	 ca 	 	:	Open	for	 Bu 	 s 	 iness 	 	.	''
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	video	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	won	an	 a 	 ward 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	best	 document 	 ary 	 	of	the	year	.
 Under 	 stand 	 	that	the	woman	who	made	it	is	going	to	be	in	Tanzania	,	where	they	're	 hav 	 ing 	 	the	session	in	 Ju 	 ne 	 	.
But	it	 show 	 s 	 	you	 African 	 s 	 	,	and	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	African	women	,	who	against	all	 odd 	 s 	 	have	 develop 	 ed 	 	 business 	 es 	 	,	some	of	them	 world 	 - 	 class 	 	.
One	of	the	women	in	 th 	 is 	 	video	,	Adenike	Ogunlesi	,	making	children	's	 clothe 	 s 	 	--	which	she	 start 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	hobby	and	grew	 in 	 to 	 	a	business	.
 Mix 	 ing 	 	African	 material 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	have	,	with	 material 	 s 	 	from	 else 	 where 	 	.
So	,	she	'll	make	a	little	pair	of	 dung 	 are 	 es 	 	with	 cord 	 uro 	 y 	 s 	 	,	with	African	material	 mix 	 ed 	 	in	.	 Ver 	 y 	 	creative	 design 	 s 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 reach 	 ed 	 	a	stage	where	she	even	had	an	order	from	 Wal 	 - 	 Mart 	 	.
For	10,000	 piece 	 s 	 	.
So	that	 show 	 s 	 	you	that	we	have	people	who	are	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 do 	 ing 	 	.
And	the	women	are	diligent	.	 The 	 y 	 	are	focused	;	they	work	hard	.
I	could	go	on	giving	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	:	Beatrice	Gakuba	of	Rwanda	,	who	 open 	 ed 	 	up	a	flower	business	and	is	now	 export 	 ing 	 	to	the	Dutch	auction	in	Amsterdam	each	 morn 	 ing 	 	and	is	 employ 	 ing 	 	200	other	women	and	men	to	work	with	her	.
 How 	 ever 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	of	these	are	 starv 	 ed 	 	for	capital	to	expand	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 no 	 body 	 	 believ 	 es 	 	 out 	 side 	 	of	our	 count 	 ries 	 	that	we	can	do	what	is	 necess 	 ary 	 	.	 No 	 body 	 	 think 	 s 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	a	market	.
 No 	 body 	 	 think 	 s 	 	there	's	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.
But	I	'm	 stand 	 ing 	 	here	 say 	 ing 	 	that	 t 	 hose 	 	who	 mis 	 s 	 	the	boat	now	,	will	 mis 	 s 	 	it	 fore 	 ver 	 	.
So	if	you	want	to	be	in	 Afri 	 ca 	 	,	think	about	 invest 	 ing 	 	.
Think	about	the	 Beatrice 	 s 	 	,	think	about	the	 Adenike 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	world	,	who	are	 do 	 ing 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	that	are	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	them	 in 	 to 	 	the	global	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	whilst	at	the	same	time	making	 s 	 ure 	 	that	 the 	 ir 	 	fellow	men	and	women	are	 employ 	 ed 	 	,	and	that	the	children	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 house 	 hold 	 s 	 	get	educated	 be 	 cause 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	are	 earn 	 ing 	 	 ad 	 equate 	 	income	.
So	I	 invit 	 e 	 	you	to	explore	the	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	.
When	you	go	to	Tanzania	,	listen	 care 	 fully 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	I	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	you	will	hear	of	the	 vari 	 ous 	 	 open 	 ing 	 s 	 	that	there	will	be	for	you	to	get	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 some 	 thing 	 	that	will	do	good	for	the	continent	,	for	the	people	and	for	 your 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
Thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
One	of	the	 problem 	 s 	 	of	writing	,	and	 work 	 ing 	 	,	and	looking	at	the	Internet	is	that	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	 separat 	 e 	 	fashion	from	deep	change	.
And	so	,	to	start	 help 	 ing 	 	that	,	I	want	to	take	us	back	to	1835	.
In	1835	,	 Jam 	 es 	 	 G 	 or 	 don 	 	 Ben 	 nett 	 	 found 	 ed 	 	the	first	 mass 	 - 	 circul 	 ation 	 	 news 	 paper 	 	in	New	York	City	.
And	it	cost	about	500	 dollar 	 s 	 	to	start	it	,	which	was	about	the	 equi 	 valent 	 	of	10,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	of	 to 	 day 	 	.
By	15	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	by	1850	,	 do 	 ing 	 	the	same	thing	--	 start 	 ing 	 	what	was	 experience 	 d 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	mass	--	 circul 	 ation 	 	 dai 	 ly 	 	paper	--	would	come	to	cost	two	and	a	half	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
10,000	,	two	and	a	half	million	,	15	 year 	 s 	 	.
That	's	the	critical	change	that	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 in 	 vert 	 ed 	 	by	the	Net	.
And	that	's	what	I	want	to	talk	about	 to 	 day 	 	,	and	how	that	 relat 	 es 	 	to	the	emergence	of	social	production	.
 Start 	 ing 	 	with	 news 	 paper 	 s 	 	,	what	we	saw	was	high	cost	 a 	 s 	 	an	 initi 	 al 	 	 requir 	 ement 	 	for	making	information	,	knowledge	and	culture	,	which	led	to	a	 star 	 k 	 	 bifurc 	 ation 	 	between	 produce 	 rs 	 	--	who	had	to	be	able	to	raise	financial	capital	,	just	like	any	other	industrial	 organ 	 ization 	 	--	and	 pass 	 ive 	 	 consumer 	 s 	 	that	could	 choos 	 e 	 	from	a	certain	set	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	industrial	model	could	produce	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	the	term	``	information	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	''	``	information	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	''	for	a	 ver 	 y 	 	long	time	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	used	 a 	 s 	 	the	thing	that	 come 	 s 	 	after	the	industrial	revolution	.	But	in	fact	,	for	 purpose 	 s 	 	of	 understand 	 ing 	 	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	that	's	wrong	.	 Be 	 cause 	 	for	150	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	've	had	an	information	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
It	's	just	 be 	 en 	 	industrial	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	producing	had	to	have	a	way	of	raising	money	to	pay	 t 	 hose 	 	two	and	a	half	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	and	 lat 	 er 	 	,	more	for	the	 tele 	 graph 	 	,	and	the	radio	 transmit 	 ter 	 	,	and	the	 tele 	 vision 	 	,	and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	the	 main 	 frame 	 	.
And	that	 me 	 ant 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	market	based	,	or	they	 we 	 re 	 	government	owned	,	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	what	kind	of	system	they	 we 	 re 	 	in	.	And	 th 	 is 	 	 character 	 ized 	 	and	 anchor 	 ed 	 	the	way	information	and	knowledge	 we 	 re 	 	 produce 	 d 	 	for	the	next	150	 year 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	let	me	tell	you	a	different	story	.	 A 	 round 	 	 Ju 	 ne 	 	2002	,	the	world	of	 super 	 computer 	 s 	 	had	a	 bomb 	 shell 	 	.
The	 Japan 	 ese 	 	had	,	for	the	first	time	,	 create 	 d 	 	the	 fast 	 est 	 	 super 	 computer 	 	--	the	NEC	Earth	 Simul 	 ator 	 	--	taking	the	 prim 	 ary 	 	from	the	U.S.	,	and	about	two	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	,	by	the	way	,	is	 measur 	 ing 	 	the	trillion	 float 	 ing 	 - 	 point 	 	 operation 	 s 	 	per	second	that	the	computer	's	 cap 	 able 	 	of	running	--	 sig 	 h 	 	of	relief	:	IBM	[	Blue	Gene	]	 ha 	 s 	 	just	 ed 	 ged 	 	 a 	 head 	 	of	the	NEC	Earth	 Simul 	 ator 	 	.
All	of	 th 	 is 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	 ignor 	 es 	 	the	fact	that	 through 	 out 	 	 th 	 is 	 	period	,	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	 super 	 computer 	 	running	in	the	world	--	 SE 	 TI 	 	@	home	.
Four	and	a	half	million	 user 	 s 	 	around	the	world	,	 con 	 trib 	 uting 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 left 	 over 	 	computer	 cycle 	 s 	 	,	 when 	 ever 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	computer	is	n't	 work 	 ing 	 	,	by	running	a	screen	saver	,	and	together	sharing	 the 	 ir 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	to	create	a	massive	 super 	 computer 	 	that	 NAS 	 A 	 	 harness 	 es 	 	to	 analyz 	 e 	 	the	data	coming	from	radio	 tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	.
What	 th 	 is 	 	picture	 suggest 	 s 	 	to	us	is	that	we	've	got	a	radical	change	in	the	way	information	production	and	 ex 	 change 	 	is	 capital 	 ized 	 	.	Not	that	it	's	 be 	 come 	 	less	capital	intensive	--	that	there	's	less	money	that	's	 requir 	 ed 	 	--	but	that	the	 owner 	 ship 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	capital	,	the	way	the	 capital 	 ization 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	,	is	 radical 	 ly 	 	 distribut 	 ed 	 	.	 E 	 ach 	 	of	us	,	in	these	 advance 	 d 	 	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	one	of	these	,	or	 some 	 thing 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	like	it	--	a	computer	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	not	 radical 	 ly 	 	different	from	 route 	 rs 	 	 in 	 side 	 	the	middle	of	the	network	.
And	computation	,	 s 	 to 	 rage 	 	and	 communication 	 s 	 	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	are	in	the	 hand 	 s 	 	of	 practical 	 ly 	 	every	 connect 	 ed 	 	person	--	and	these	are	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	physical	capital	 mean 	 s 	 	 necess 	 ary 	 	for	producing	information	,	knowledge	and	culture	,	in	the	 hand 	 s 	 	of	 some 	 thing 	 	like	600	million	to	a	billion	people	around	the	planet	.
What	 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	is	that	for	the	first	time	since	the	industrial	revolution	,	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	,	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 component 	 s 	 	of	the	core	economic	 activ 	 ities 	 	--	remember	,	we	are	in	an	information	 eco 	 nomy 	 	--	of	the	most	 advance 	 d 	 	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	,	and	there	more	than	 any 	 where 	 	else	,	are	in	the	 hand 	 s 	 	of	the	population	at	large	.	 Th 	 is 	 	is	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	than	what	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	since	the	industrial	revolution	.	So	we	've	got	 communication 	 s 	 	and	computation	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	in	the	 hand 	 s 	 	of	the	entire	population	,	and	we	've	got	human	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	,	human	 wis 	 dom 	 	,	human	experience	--	the	other	major	experience	,	the	other	major	 in 	 put 	 	--	which	 un 	 like 	 	simple	labor	--	stand	here	 turn 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	lever	all	day	long	--	is	not	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	the	same	or	fungible	among	people	.
Any	one	of	you	who	 ha 	 s 	 	taken	 some 	 one 	 	else	's	job	,	or	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	give	 your 	 s 	 	to	 some 	 one 	 	else	,	no	matter	how	 detail 	 ed 	 	the	manual	,	you	can	not	transmit	what	you	know	,	what	you	will	intuit	under	a	certain	set	of	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	.
In	that	we	're	 un 	 ique 	 	,	and	each	of	us	 hold 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	critical	 in 	 put 	 	 in 	 to 	 	production	 a 	 s 	 	we	hold	 th 	 is 	 	machine	.
What	's	the	effect	of	 th 	 is 	 	?	So	,	the	story	that	most	people	know	is	the	story	of	free	or	open	source	 soft 	 ware 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	market	share	of	 Ap 	 ache 	 	Web	 serv 	 er 	 	--	one	of	the	critical	 application 	 s 	 	in	 Web 	 - 	 based 	 	 communication 	 s 	 	.
In	1995	,	two	 group 	 s 	 	of	people	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 W 	 ow 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	the	Web	!	We	need	a	much	better	Web	 serv 	 er 	 	!	''
One	was	a	 mot 	 ley 	 	 collect 	 ion 	 	of	 volunteer 	 s 	 	who	just	 decide 	 d 	 	,	you	know	,	we	 re 	 ally 	 	need	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	should	write	one	,	and	what	are	we	going	to	do	with	what	--	well	,	we	're	gon	na	share	it	!	And	other	people	will	be	able	to	develop	it	.
The	other	was	 Micro 	 soft 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	if	I	told	you	that	10	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	the	 mot 	 ley 	 	crew	of	people	,	who	did	n't	control	 any 	 thing 	 	that	they	 produce 	 d 	 	,	 acquir 	 ed 	 	20	percent	of	the	market	and	was	the	red	line	,	it	would	be	 amaz 	 ing 	 	!	Right	?
Think	of	it	in	 mini 	 van 	 s 	 	.	A	group	of	 auto 	 mobile 	 	 engineer 	 s 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 week 	 end 	 s 	 	are	 com 	 pet 	 ing 	 	with	 Toy 	 ota 	 	.	Right	?
But	,	in	fact	,	of	course	,	the	story	is	it	's	the	70	percent	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	the	major	 e 	 - 	 commerce 	 	 s 	 ite 	 	--	70	percent	of	a	critical	application	on	which	 Web 	 - 	 based 	 	 communication 	 s 	 	and	 application 	 s 	 	work	is	 produce 	 d 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	form	,	in	direct	 com 	 petition 	 	with	 Micro 	 soft 	 	.	Not	in	a	side	issue	--	in	a	central	 strat 	 egic 	 	decision	to	try	to	capture	a	component	of	the	Net	.
 So 	 ft 	 ware 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	 th 	 is 	 	in	a	way	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	visible	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 measur 	 able 	 	.	But	the	thing	to	see	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	 through 	 out 	 	the	Web	.
So	,	 NAS 	 A 	 	,	at	some	point	,	did	an	experiment	where	they	took	 image 	 s 	 	of	 Mar 	 s 	 	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	mapping	,	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 hav 	 ing 	 	three	or	four	fully	trained	 Ph.D 	 . 	 s 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	all	the	time	,	let	's	break	it	up	 in 	 to 	 	small	 component 	 s 	 	,	put	it	up	on	the	Web	,	and	see	if	people	,	using	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 inter 	 face 	 	,	will	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 pend 	 	five	 minute 	 s 	 	here	,	10	 minute 	 s 	 	there	,	 click 	 ing 	 	.	After	six	 month 	 s 	 	,	85,000	people	used	 th 	 is 	 	to	generate	mapping	at	a	 fast 	 er 	 	rate	than	the	 image 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	coming	in	,	which	was	,	quote	,	``	 practical 	 ly 	 	 in 	 distinguish 	 able 	 	from	the	 mark 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	a	fully-trained	 Ph.D 	 . 	 	,	''	once	you	 show 	 ed 	 	it	to	a	number	of	people	and	 compute 	 d 	 	the	average	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	if	you	have	a	little	girl	,	and	she	 go 	 es 	 	and	 write 	 s 	 	to	--	well	,	not	so	little	,	medium	little	--	tries	to	do	research	on	Barbie	.
And	she	'll	come	to	 En 	 cart 	 a 	 	,	one	of	the	main	 on 	 line 	 	 encyclopedia 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	what	you	'll	find	out	about	Barbie	.	 Th 	 is 	 	is	it	,	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	more	to	the	definition	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	,	``	 manufactur 	 ers 	 	''	--	plural	--	``	now	more	 common 	 ly 	 	produce	 ethnic 	 ally 	 	 divers 	 e 	 	 doll 	 s 	 	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	black	Barbie	.	''	 Whi 	 ch 	 	is	 vast 	 ly 	 	better	than	what	you	'll	find	in	the	 encyclopedia 	 .com 	 	,	which	is	Barbie	,	 K 	 laus 	 	.
On	the	other	hand	,	if	they	go	to	Wikipedia	,	they	'll	find	a	genuine	article	--	and	I	wo	n't	talk	a	lot	about	Wikipedia	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 Jim 	 my 	 	 Wal 	 es 	 	is	here	--	but	 rough 	 ly 	 	 equi 	 valent 	 	to	what	you	would	find	in	the	 Brit 	 annica 	 	,	 different 	 ly 	 	written	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	the	 contr 	 over 	 s 	 ies 	 	over	body	image	and	 commercial 	 ization 	 	,	the	 claim 	 s 	 	about	the	way	in	which	she	's	a	good	role	model	,	etc	.
 An 	 other 	 	 port 	 ion 	 	is	not	 on 	 ly 	 	how	content	is	 produce 	 d 	 	,	but	how	relevance	is	 produce 	 d 	 	.
The	claim	to	fame	of	 Ya 	 hoo 	 	!	was	,	we	hire	people	to	look	--	 original 	 ly 	 	,	not	 any 	 more 	 	--	we	hire	people	to	look	at	 web 	 s 	 ites 	 	and	tell	you	--	if	they	're	in	the	index	,	they	're	good	.	 Th 	 is 	 	,	on	the	other	hand	,	is	what	60,000	passionate	 volunteer 	 s 	 	produce	in	the	Open	 Direct 	 ory 	 	Project	,	each	one	 will 	 ing 	 	to	 s 	 pend 	 	an	hour	or	two	on	 some 	 thing 	 	they	 re 	 ally 	 	care	about	,	to	say	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	good	.	So	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	Open	 Direct 	 ory 	 	Project	,	with	60,000	 volunteer 	 s 	 	,	each	one	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	a	little	bit	of	time	,	 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	a	few	hundred	fully	paid	 employ 	 ees 	 	.	No	one	 own 	 s 	 	it	,	no	one	 own 	 s 	 	the	 out 	 put 	 	,	it	's	free	for	 any 	 one 	 	to	use	and	it	's	the	 out 	 put 	 	of	people	 act 	 ing 	 	out	of	social	and	 psycho 	 logical 	 	 motiv 	 ations 	 	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 out 	 side 	 	of	 business 	 es 	 	.	When	you	think	of	what	is	the	critical	 innov 	 ation 	 	of	Google	,	the	critical	 innov 	 ation 	 	is	 out 	 sourcing 	 	the	one	most	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	--	the	decision	about	what	's	relevant	--	to	the	community	of	the	Web	 a 	 s 	 	a	whole	,	 do 	 ing 	 	 what 	 ever 	 	they	want	to	do	:	so	,	page	rank	.
The	critical	 innov 	 ation 	 	here	is	 in 	 stead 	 	of	our	 engineer 	 s 	 	,	or	our	people	 say 	 ing 	 	which	is	the	most	relevant	,	we	're	going	to	go	out	and	count	what	you	,	people	out	there	on	the	Web	,	for	 what 	 ever 	 	reason	--	 van 	 ity 	 	,	pleasure	--	 produce 	 d 	 	 link 	 s 	 	,	and	 ti 	 ed 	 	to	each	other	.	We	're	going	to	count	 t 	 hose 	 	,	and	count	them	up	.
And	 aga 	 in 	 	,	here	,	you	see	 Barbie 	 .com 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	 Adi 	 os 	 barb 	 ie 	 .com 	 	,	the	body	image	for	every	 s 	 ize 	 	.	A	 contest 	 ed 	 	cultural	object	,	which	you	wo	n't	find	 any 	 where 	 	soon	on	 Over 	 ture 	 	,	which	is	the	classic	 market 	 - 	 based 	 	 mechan 	 ism 	 	:	 who 	 ever 	 	 pay 	 s 	 	the	most	is	highest	on	the	list	.
So	,	all	of	that	is	in	the	creation	of	content	,	of	relevance	,	 bas 	 ic 	 	human	 express 	 ion 	 	.
But	remember	,	the	 computer 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 so 	 	physical	.	Just	physical	 material 	 s 	 	--	our	 PC 	 s 	 	--	we	share	them	together	.	We	 al 	 so 	 	see	 th 	 is 	 	in	 wire 	 less 	 	.
It	used	to	be	 wire 	 less 	 	was	one	person	owned	the	 licens 	 e 	 	,	they	 transmit 	 ted 	 	in	an	area	,	and	it	had	to	be	 decide 	 d 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	they	would	be	 licens 	 ed 	 	or	based	on	 proper 	 ty 	 	.
What	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	now	is	that	 computer 	 s 	 	and	 radio 	 s 	 	are	 be 	 coming 	 	so	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	that	we	're	 develop 	 ing 	 	 algorithm 	 s 	 	to	let	people	own	 machine 	 s 	 	,	like	 Wi 	 - 	 Fi 	 	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	,	and	 over 	 lay 	 	them	with	a	sharing	 proto 	 col 	 	that	would	allow	a	community	like	 th 	 is 	 	to	build	 it 	 s 	 	own	 wire 	 less 	 	 broad 	 band 	 	network	 simpl 	 y 	 	from	the	simple	principle	:	When	I	'm	 listen 	 ing 	 	,	when	I	'm	not	using	,	I	can	help	you	transfer	your	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	;	and	when	you	're	not	using	,	you	'll	help	me	transfer	 your 	 s 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	an	 ideal 	 ized 	 	version	.	 Th 	 ese 	 	are	 work 	 ing 	 	 model 	 s 	 	that	at	 l 	 east 	 	in	some	 place 	 s 	 	in	the	 Unit 	 ed 	 	 Stat 	 es 	 	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 implement 	 ed 	 	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	for	public	security	.
If	in	1999	I	told	you	,	let	's	build	a	data	 s 	 to 	 rage 	 	and	 retr 	 ieval 	 	system	.
It	's	got	to	store	 tera 	 byte 	 s 	 	.	It	's	got	to	be	 avail 	 able 	 	24	 hour 	 s 	 	a	day	,	seven	 day 	 s 	 	a	week	.	It	's	got	to	be	 avail 	 able 	 	from	 any 	 where 	 	in	the	world	.
It	 ha 	 s 	 	to	support	over	100	million	 user 	 s 	 	at	any	 give 	 n 	 	moment	.	It	's	got	to	be	 ro 	 bust 	 	to	attack	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 clo 	 s 	 ing 	 	the	main	index	,	 inject 	 ing 	 	 m 	 alicious 	 	 file 	 s 	 	,	 arm 	 ed 	 	seizure	of	some	major	 nod 	 es 	 	.	You	'd	say	that	would	take	 year 	 s 	 	.
It	would	take	 million 	 s 	 	.	But	of	course	,	what	I	'm	 de 	 s 	 crib 	 ing 	 	is	P2P	file	sharing	.
Right	?	We	 al 	 ways 	 	think	of	it	 a 	 s 	 	 steal 	 ing 	 	music	,	but	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	a	 distribut 	 ed 	 	data	 s 	 to 	 rage 	 	and	 retr 	 ieval 	 	system	,	where	people	,	for	 ver 	 y 	 	obvious	 reason 	 s 	 	,	are	 will 	 ing 	 	to	share	 the 	 ir 	 	 band 	 width 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 s 	 to 	 rage 	 	to	create	 some 	 thing 	 	.
So	,	 essential 	 ly 	 	what	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	is	the	emergence	of	a	fourth	 trans 	 action 	 al 	 	 frame 	 work 	 	.	It	used	to	be	that	there	 we 	 re 	 	two	 prim 	 ary 	 	 dimension 	 s 	 	 a 	 long 	 	which	you	could	divide	 thing 	 s 	 	.	 The 	 y 	 	could	be	market	based	,	or	 non 	 - 	 market 	 	based	;	they	could	be	 de 	 central 	 ized 	 	,	or	 central 	 ized 	 	.
The	price	system	was	a	 market 	 - 	 based 	 	and	 de 	 central 	 ized 	 	system	.
If	 thing 	 s 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	better	 be 	 cause 	 	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	had	 some 	 body 	 	 organ 	 izing 	 	them	,	you	had	 firm 	 s 	 	,	if	you	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	in	the	market	--	or	you	had	 government 	 s 	 	or	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 large 	 r 	 	 non 	 - 	 profit 	 s 	 	in	the	 non 	 - 	 market 	 	.
It	was	too	expensive	to	have	 de 	 central 	 ized 	 	social	production	,	to	have	 de 	 central 	 ized 	 	action	in	 socie 	 ty 	 	.	That	was	not	about	 socie 	 ty 	 	 it 	 self 	 	.
That	was	,	in	fact	,	economic	.
But	what	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	now	is	the	emergence	of	 th 	 is 	 	fourth	system	of	social	sharing	and	 ex 	 change 	 	.
Not	that	it	's	the	first	time	that	we	do	nice	 thing 	 s 	 	to	each	other	,	or	for	each	other	,	 a 	 s 	 	social	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	.	We	do	it	all	the	time	.
It	's	that	it	's	the	first	time	that	it	's	 hav 	 ing 	 	major	economic	impact	.
What	 character 	 ize 	 s 	 	them	is	 de 	 central 	 ized 	 	 author 	 ity 	 	.
You	do	n't	have	to	ask	 per 	 mission 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	do	in	a	 proper 	 ty 	 - 	 based 	 	system	.
May	I	do	 th 	 is 	 	?	It	's	open	for	 any 	 one 	 	to	create	and	 innov 	 ate 	 	and	share	,	if	they	want	to	,	by	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	or	with	 other 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 proper 	 ty 	 	is	one	 mechan 	 ism 	 	of	 coordi 	 nation 	 	.
But	it	's	not	the	 on 	 ly 	 	one	.
 In 	 stead 	 	,	what	we	see	are	social	 frame 	 work 	 s 	 	for	all	of	the	critical	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	use	 proper 	 ty 	 	and	contract	in	the	market	:	information	 flow 	 s 	 	to	decide	what	are	 interest 	 ing 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	;	who	's	 avail 	 able 	 	and	good	for	 some 	 thing 	 	;	 motiv 	 ation 	 	 structure 	 s 	 	--	remember	,	money	is	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	the	best	 motiv 	 ator 	 	.
If	you	 leav 	 e 	 	a	$	50	check	after	 d 	 inner 	 	with	 friend 	 s 	 	,	you	do	n't	 in 	 crease 	 	the	 prob 	 ability 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 invit 	 ed 	 	back	.
And	if	 d 	 inner 	 	is	n't	 entire 	 ly 	 	obvious	,	think	of	 s 	 ex 	 	.
It	 al 	 so 	 	 requir 	 es 	 	certain	new	 organ 	 ization 	 al 	 	 approach 	 es 	 	.
And	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	what	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	is	task	 organ 	 ization 	 	.
You	have	to	hire	people	who	know	what	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	.
You	have	to	hire	them	to	 s 	 pend 	 	a	lot	of	time	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	take	the	same	problem	,	chunk	it	 in 	 to 	 	little	 modul 	 es 	 	,	and	 motiv 	 ations 	 	 be 	 come 	 	trivial	.
Five	 minute 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 watch 	 ing 	 	TV	?
Five	 minute 	 s 	 	I	'll	 s 	 pend 	 	just	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	.	Just	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 f 	 un 	 	.
Just	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 give 	 s 	 	me	a	certain	sense	of	meaning	,	or	,	in	 place 	 s 	 	that	are	more	 involve 	 d 	 	,	like	Wikipedia	,	 give 	 s 	 	me	a	certain	set	of	social	 relation 	 s 	 	.
So	,	a	new	social	 phenomen 	 on 	 	is	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	.
It	's	creating	,	and	it	's	most	visible	when	we	see	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	new	form	of	 com 	 petition 	 	.
 Pe 	 er 	 - 	 to 	 - 	 peer 	 	 network 	 s 	 	 assault 	 ing 	 	the	 record 	 ing 	 	industry	;	free	and	open	source	 soft 	 ware 	 	taking	market	share	from	 Micro 	 soft 	 	;	 Sky 	 pe 	 	 potential 	 ly 	 	 threaten 	 ing 	 	 tradition 	 al 	 	 tele 	 com 	 s 	 	;	Wikipedia	 com 	 pet 	 ing 	 	with	 on 	 line 	 	 encyclopedia 	 s 	 	.
But	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	new	source	of	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	for	 business 	 es 	 	.
 A 	 s 	 	you	see	a	new	set	of	social	 relation 	 s 	 	and	 behavior 	 s 	 	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	,	you	have	new	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	.	Some	of	them	are	 tool 	 makers 	 	.
 In 	 stead 	 	of	building	 well 	 - 	 behav 	 ed 	 	 appli 	 ance 	 s 	 	--	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	know	what	they	'll	do	in	advance	--	you	begin	to	build	more	open	 tool 	 s 	 	.	There	's	a	new	set	of	 value 	 s 	 	,	a	new	set	of	 thing 	 s 	 	people	value	.
You	build	 platform 	 s 	 	for	 self 	 - 	 express 	 ion 	 	and	 collabor 	 ation 	 	.
Like	Wikipedia	,	like	the	Open	 Direct 	 ory 	 	Project	,	you	're	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	build	 platform 	 s 	 	,	and	you	see	that	 a 	 s 	 	a	model	.
And	you	see	 surf 	 ers 	 	,	people	who	see	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	,	and	in	some	sense	build	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	supply	chain	,	which	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 cur 	 ious 	 	one	.	Right	?
You	have	a	belief	:	stuff	will	flow	out	of	 connect 	 ed 	 	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
That	'll	give	me	 some 	 thing 	 	I	can	use	,	and	I	'm	going	to	contract	with	 some 	 one 	 	.
I	will	deliver	 some 	 thing 	 	based	on	what	 happen 	 s 	 	.	It	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 scar 	 y 	 	--	that	's	what	Google	 do 	 es 	 	,	 essential 	 ly 	 	.
That	's	what	IBM	 do 	 es 	 	in	 soft 	 ware 	 	 service 	 s 	 	,	and	they	've	 d 	 one 	 	 reason 	 ably 	 	well	.
So	,	social	production	is	a	real	fact	,	not	a	fad	.
It	is	the	critical	 long 	 - 	 term 	 	shift	 caus 	 ed 	 	by	the	Internet	.
 So 	 cial 	 	 relation 	 s 	 	and	 ex 	 change 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 significant 	 ly 	 	more	 import 	 ant 	 	than	they	ever	 we 	 re 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	economic	 phenomen 	 on 	 	.	In	some	 con 	 text 	 s 	 	,	it	's	even	more	efficient	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	quality	of	the	information	,	the	ability	to	find	the	best	person	,	the	lower	 trans 	 action 	 	 cost 	 s 	 	.	It	's	 sustain 	 able 	 	and	growing	fast	.
But	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	dark	lining	--	it	is	 threaten 	 ed 	 	by	--	in	the	same	way	that	it	 threaten 	 s 	 	--	the	 in 	 cum 	 bent 	 	industrial	 system 	 s 	 	.
So	next	time	you	open	the	paper	,	and	you	see	an	intellectual	 proper 	 ty 	 	decision	,	a	 tele 	 com 	 s 	 	decision	,	it	's	not	about	 some 	 thing 	 	small	and	technical	.
It	is	about	the	future	of	the	 free 	 dom 	 	to	be	 a 	 s 	 	social	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	with	each	other	,	and	the	way	information	,	knowledge	and	culture	will	be	 produce 	 d 	 	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	it	is	in	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 text 	 	that	we	see	a	battle	over	how	easy	or	hard	it	will	be	for	the	industrial	information	 eco 	 nomy 	 	to	 simpl 	 y 	 	go	on	 a 	 s 	 	it	 go 	 es 	 	,	or	for	the	new	model	of	production	to	begin	to	develop	 a 	 long 	 side 	 	that	industrial	model	,	and	change	the	way	we	begin	to	see	the	world	and	report	what	it	is	that	we	see	.
Thank	you	.
Do	you	worry	about	what	is	going	to	kill	you	?
Heart	disease	,	cancer	,	a	car	accident	?
 Mo 	 st 	 	of	us	worry	about	 thing 	 s 	 	we	ca	n't	control	,	like	war	,	 terror 	 ism 	 	,	the	tragic	 earth 	 quake 	 	that	just	 occur 	 red 	 	in	Haiti	.
But	what	 re 	 ally 	 	 threaten 	 s 	 	 human 	 ity 	 	?
A	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 Profess 	 or 	 	 Vac 	 lav 	 	Smil	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	 calcul 	 ate 	 	the	 prob 	 ability 	 	of	sudden	 disaster 	 s 	 	large	 en 	 ough 	 	to	change	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
He	 call 	 ed 	 	these	,	``	 massive 	 ly 	 	fatal	 dis 	 continu 	 ities 	 	,	''	meaning	that	they	could	kill	up	to	100	million	people	in	the	next	50	 year 	 s 	 	.
He	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	 odd 	 s 	 	of	 an 	 other 	 	world	war	,	of	a	massive	 volcan 	 ic 	 	 erupt 	 ion 	 	,	even	of	an	 a 	 steroid 	 	hitting	the	Earth	.
But	he	 place 	 d 	 	the	 like 	 li 	 hood 	 	of	one	 s 	 uch 	 	event	above	all	 other 	 s 	 	at	close	to	100	percent	,	and	that	is	a	severe	flu	 pan 	 demic 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	you	might	think	of	flu	 a 	 s 	 	just	a	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	cold	,	but	it	can	be	a	death	sentence	.
Every	year	,	36,000	people	in	the	 Unit 	 ed 	 	 Stat 	 es 	 	die	of	 season 	 al 	 	flu	.
In	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	,	the	data	is	much	 sketch 	 ier 	 	but	the	death	toll	is	 al 	 most 	 	 certain 	 ly 	 	 high 	 er 	 	.
You	know	,	the	problem	is	if	 th 	 is 	 	virus	 occasion 	 ally 	 	 mut 	 ates 	 	so	 dramat 	 ically 	 	,	it	 essential 	 ly 	 	is	a	new	virus	and	then	we	get	a	 pan 	 demic 	 	.
In	1918	,	a	new	virus	 appear 	 ed 	 	that	 kill 	 ed 	 	some	50	to	100	million	people	.
It	spread	like	 wild 	 fire 	 	and	some	 di 	 ed 	 	 with 	 in 	 	 hour 	 s 	 	of	 develop 	 ing 	 	 symptom 	 s 	 	.
 A 	 re 	 	we	 safe 	 r 	 	 to 	 day 	 	?
Well	,	we	seem	to	have	 dodge 	 d 	 	the	 dead 	 ly 	 	 pan 	 demic 	 	 th 	 is 	 	year	that	most	of	us	 fear 	 ed 	 	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	threat	could	 re 	 appear 	 	at	any	time	.
The	good	news	is	that	we	're	at	a	moment	in	time	when	science	,	technology	,	 global 	 ization 	 	is	 converg 	 ing 	 	to	create	an	unprecedented	 possibil 	 ity 	 	:	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	to	make	 histo 	 ry 	 	by	 prevent 	 ing 	 	 infect 	 ious 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	that	still	account	for	 one 	 - 	 fifth 	 	of	all	 death 	 s 	 	and	 count 	 less 	 	 mis 	 ery 	 	on	Earth	.
We	can	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
We	're	 al 	 ready 	 	 prevent 	 ing 	 	 million 	 s 	 	of	 death 	 s 	 	with	 exist 	 ing 	 	 vaccin 	 es 	 	,	and	if	we	get	these	to	more	people	,	we	can	 certain 	 ly 	 	 s 	 ave 	 	more	 live 	 s 	 	.
But	with	new	or	better	 vaccin 	 es 	 	for	malaria	,	TB	,	HIV	,	 pneumo 	 nia 	 	,	 dia 	 rrhea 	 	,	flu	,	we	could	end	 suffer 	 ing 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	on	the	Earth	since	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	time	.
So	,	I	'm	here	to	 trump 	 et 	 	 vaccin 	 es 	 	for	you	.
But	first	,	I	have	to	explain	why	they	're	 import 	 ant 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 vaccin 	 es 	 	,	the	power	of	them	,	is	 re 	 ally 	 	like	a	whisper	.
When	they	work	,	they	can	make	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	but	after	a	while	you	can	 bare 	 ly 	 	hear	them	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	some	of	us	are	old	 en 	 ough 	 	to	have	a	small	,	 circul 	 ar 	 	scar	on	our	 arm 	 s 	 	from	an	 inocul 	 ation 	 	we	 receiv 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	children	.
But	when	was	the	last	time	you	 worri 	 ed 	 	about	 small 	 pox 	 	,	a	disease	that	 kill 	 ed 	 	half	a	billion	people	last	century	and	no	 long 	 er 	 	is	with	us	?
Or	 poli 	 o 	 	?	How	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	remember	the	iron	lung	?
We	do	n't	see	 scene 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	 any 	 more 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 vaccin 	 es 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	it	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	there	are	30-odd	 disease 	 s 	 	that	can	be	 treat 	 ed 	 	with	 vaccin 	 es 	 	now	,	but	we	're	still	 threaten 	 ed 	 	by	 thing 	 s 	 	like	HIV	and	flu	.
Why	is	that	?
Well	,	here	's	the	 dirt 	 y 	 	little	secret	.
 Un 	 til 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	we	have	n't	had	to	know	 exact 	 ly 	 	how	a	 vaccin 	 e 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	.
We	 k 	 new 	 	they	 work 	 ed 	 	through	 old 	 - 	 fashion 	 ed 	 	trial	and	error	.
You	took	a	pathogen	,	you	 modifi 	 ed 	 	it	,	you	 inject 	 ed 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	person	or	an	animal	and	you	saw	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	well	for	most	 pathogen 	 s 	 	,	 some 	 what 	 	well	for	 craft 	 y 	 	 bug 	 s 	 	like	flu	,	but	not	at	all	for	HIV	,	for	which	 human 	 s 	 	have	no	natural	 immun 	 ity 	 	.
So	let	's	explore	how	 vaccin 	 es 	 	work	.
 The 	 y 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	create	a	cache	of	 weapon 	 s 	 	for	your	 immun 	 e 	 	system	which	you	can	deploy	when	 need 	 ed 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	when	you	get	a	viral	 infect 	 ion 	 	,	what	 normal 	 ly 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	is	it	 take 	 s 	 	 day 	 s 	 	or	 week 	 s 	 	for	your	body	to	fight	back	at	full	strength	,	and	that	might	be	too	late	.
When	you	're	 pre 	 - 	 immun 	 ized 	 	,	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	you	have	 force 	 s 	 	in	your	body	 pre 	 - 	 trained 	 	to	 recogn 	 ize 	 	and	defeat	specific	 foe 	 s 	 	.
So	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	how	 vaccin 	 es 	 	work	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	let	's	take	a	look	at	a	video	that	we	're	 debut 	 ing 	 	at	TED	,	for	the	first	time	,	on	how	an	effective	HIV	 vaccin 	 e 	 	might	work	.
 Nar 	 rator 	 	:	A	 vaccin 	 e 	 	 train 	 s 	 	the	body	in	advance	how	to	 recogn 	 ize 	 	and	 neutral 	 ize 	 	a	specific	 invad 	 er 	 	.
After	HIV	 penetrate 	 s 	 	the	body	's	 mucosa 	 l 	 	 bar 	 rier 	 s 	 	,	it	 infect 	 s 	 	 immun 	 e 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	to	replicate	.
The	 invad 	 er 	 	 draw 	 s 	 	the	attention	of	the	 immun 	 e 	 	system	's	 front 	 - 	 line 	 	 troop 	 s 	 	.
 Den 	 dritic 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	,	or	 macro 	 phage 	 s 	 	,	capture	the	virus	and	 dis 	 play 	 	 piece 	 s 	 	of	it	.
 Memo 	 ry 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	generated	by	the	HIV	 vaccin 	 e 	 	are	 activate 	 d 	 	when	they	learn	HIV	is	present	from	the	 front 	 - 	 line 	 	 troop 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	 memor 	 y 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	deploy	the	exact	 weapon 	 s 	 	 need 	 ed 	 	.
 Memo 	 ry 	 	B	 cell 	 s 	 	turn	 in 	 to 	 	plasma	 cell 	 s 	 	,	which	produce	wave	after	wave	of	the	specific	 anti 	 bodies 	 	that	latch	onto	HIV	to	prevent	it	from	 infect 	 ing 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	,	while	 s 	 quad 	 ron 	 s 	 	of	killer	T	 cell 	 s 	 	seek	out	and	destroy	 cell 	 s 	 	that	are	 al 	 ready 	 	HIV	 infect 	 ed 	 	.
The	virus	is	 defeat 	 ed 	 	.
 With 	 out 	 	a	 vaccin 	 e 	 	,	these	 respons 	 es 	 	would	have	taken	more	than	a	week	.
By	that	time	,	the	battle	against	HIV	would	 al 	 ready 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	lost	.
 Se 	 th 	 	 Berk 	 ley 	 	:	 Re 	 ally 	 	cool	video	,	is	n't	it	?
The	 anti 	 bodies 	 	you	just	saw	in	 th 	 is 	 	video	,	in	action	,	are	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	make	most	 vaccin 	 es 	 	work	.
So	the	real	question	then	is	:	How	do	we	ensure	that	your	body	 make 	 s 	 	the	exact	 one 	 s 	 	that	we	need	to	protect	against	flu	and	HIV	?
The	principal	 challeng 	 e 	 	for	both	of	these	viruses	is	that	they	're	 al 	 ways 	 	changing	.
So	let	's	take	a	look	at	the	flu	virus	.
In	 th 	 is 	 	 render 	 ing 	 	of	the	flu	virus	,	these	different	 color 	 ed 	 	 spike 	 s 	 	are	what	it	uses	to	infect	you	.
And	 al 	 so 	 	,	what	the	 anti 	 bodies 	 	use	is	a	handle	to	 essential 	 ly 	 	grab	and	 neutral 	 ize 	 	the	virus	.
When	these	 mut 	 ate 	 	,	they	change	 the 	 ir 	 	shape	,	and	the	 anti 	 bodies 	 	do	n't	know	what	they	're	looking	at	 any 	 more 	 	.
So	that	's	why	every	year	you	can	catch	a	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	different	 s 	 train 	 	of	flu	.
It	's	 al 	 so 	 	why	in	the	spring	,	we	have	to	make	a	best	guess	at	which	three	 s 	 train 	 s 	 	are	going	to	prevail	the	next	year	,	put	 t 	 hose 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	single	 vaccin 	 e 	 	and	rush	 t 	 hose 	 	 in 	 to 	 	production	for	the	fall	.
Even	 wo 	 rse 	 	,	the	most	common	influenza	--	influenza	A	--	 al 	 so 	 	 infect 	 s 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	that	live	in	close	 proxim 	 ity 	 	to	 human 	 s 	 	,	and	they	can	 re 	 combine 	 	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	.
In	 add 	 ition 	 	,	wild	 aqua 	 tic 	 	 bird 	 s 	 	carry	all	known	 s 	 train 	 s 	 	of	influenza	.
So	,	you	've	got	 th 	 is 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	:	In	2003	,	we	had	an	 H5N 	 1 	 	virus	that	 jump 	 ed 	 	from	 bird 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 human 	 s 	 	in	a	few	 isolate 	 d 	 	 case 	 s 	 	with	an	 ap 	 parent 	 	 mortal 	 ity 	 	rate	of	70	percent	.
 N 	 ow 	 	 luck 	 ily 	 	,	that	 part 	 icular 	 	virus	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 scar 	 y 	 	at	the	time	,	did	not	transmit	from	person	to	person	 ver 	 y 	 	 eas 	 ily 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	year	's	 H1N 	 1 	 	threat	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	human	,	 av 	 ian 	 	,	 s 	 wine 	 	 mix 	 ture 	 	that	 a 	 rose 	 	in	Mexico	.
It	was	 eas 	 ily 	 	 transmit 	 ted 	 	,	but	,	 luck 	 ily 	 	,	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	mild	.
And	so	,	in	a	sense	,	our	luck	is	 hold 	 ing 	 	out	,	but	you	know	,	 an 	 other 	 	wild	bird	could	fly	over	at	 any 	 time 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	let	's	take	a	look	at	HIV	.
 A 	 s 	 	 vari 	 able 	 	 a 	 s 	 	flu	is	,	HIV	 make 	 s 	 	flu	look	like	the	Rock	of	 Gib 	 ral 	 tar 	 	.
The	virus	that	 cause 	 s 	 	AIDS	is	the	 trick 	 iest 	 	pathogen	 scientist 	 s 	 	have	ever	 confront 	 ed 	 	.
It	 mut 	 ates 	 	 fur 	 iously 	 	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 decoy 	 s 	 	to	 evad 	 e 	 	the	 immun 	 e 	 	system	,	it	 attack 	 s 	 	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	that	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	fight	it	and	it	 quick 	 ly 	 	 hide 	 s 	 	 it 	 self 	 	in	your	genome	.
 He 	 re 	 	's	a	slide	looking	at	the	genetic	 vari 	 ation 	 	of	flu	and	 compar 	 ing 	 	that	to	HIV	,	a	much	 wild 	 er 	 	target	.
In	the	video	a	moment	ago	,	you	saw	 fleet 	 s 	 	of	new	viruses	 launch 	 ing 	 	from	 infect 	 ed 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	 real 	 ize 	 	that	in	a	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 infect 	 ed 	 	person	,	there	are	 million 	 s 	 	of	these	 ship 	 s 	 	;	each	one	is	just	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	different	.
 Find 	 ing 	 	a	weapon	that	 recogn 	 ize 	 s 	 	and	 sink 	 s 	 	all	of	them	 make 	 s 	 	the	job	that	much	 hard 	 er 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	in	the	27	 year 	 s 	 	since	HIV	was	identified	 a 	 s 	 	the	cause	of	AIDS	,	we	've	 develop 	 ed 	 	more	 drug 	 s 	 	to	treat	HIV	than	all	other	viruses	put	together	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	 drug 	 s 	 	are	n't	 cure 	 s 	 	,	but	they	represent	a	huge	triumph	of	science	 be 	 cause 	 	they	take	away	the	 autom 	 atic 	 	death	sentence	from	a	 diagnos 	 is 	 	of	HIV	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	for	 t 	 hose 	 	who	can	access	them	.
The	 vaccin 	 e 	 	effort	 th 	 ough 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	different	.
Large	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	 move 	 d 	 	away	from	it	 be 	 cause 	 	they	thought	the	science	was	so	difficult	and	 vaccin 	 es 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 een 	 	 a 	 s 	 	poor	business	.
 Man 	 y 	 	thought	that	it	was	just	 im 	 possible 	 	to	make	an	AIDS	 vaccin 	 e 	 	,	but	 to 	 day 	 	,	evidence	 tell 	 s 	 	us	 other 	 wise 	 	.
In	September	,	we	had	surprising	but	 excit 	 ing 	 	 find 	 ing 	 s 	 	from	a	 clinic 	 al 	 	trial	that	took	place	in	 Thai 	 land 	 	.
For	the	first	time	,	we	saw	an	AIDS	 vaccin 	 e 	 	work	in	 human 	 s 	 	--	albeit	,	 quit 	 e 	 	 modest 	 ly 	 	--	and	that	 part 	 icular 	 	 vaccin 	 e 	 	was	made	 al 	 most 	 	a	decade	ago	.
 New 	 er 	 	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	and	early	 test 	 ing 	 	now	show	even	 great 	 er 	 	promise	in	the	best	of	our	animal	 model 	 s 	 	.
But	in	the	past	few	 month 	 s 	 	,	 research 	 ers 	 	have	 al 	 so 	 	 isolate 	 d 	 	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	new	 broad 	 ly 	 	 neutral 	 izing 	 	 anti 	 bodies 	 	from	the	blood	of	an	HIV	 infect 	 ed 	 	individual	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	what	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	mean	?
We	saw	 ear 	 lier 	 	that	HIV	is	 high 	 ly 	 	 vari 	 able 	 	,	that	a	broad	 neutral 	 izing 	 	 anti 	 body 	 	 latch 	 es 	 	on	and	 dis 	 able 	 s 	 	 multi 	 ple 	 	 vari 	 ations 	 	of	the	virus	.
If	you	take	these	and	you	put	them	in	the	best	of	our	monkey	 model 	 s 	 	,	they	provide	full	 protect 	 ion 	 	from	 infect 	 ion 	 	.
In	 add 	 ition 	 	,	these	 research 	 ers 	 	found	a	new	 s 	 ite 	 	on	HIV	where	the	 anti 	 bodies 	 	can	grab	onto	,	and	what	's	so	special	about	 th 	 is 	 	spot	is	that	it	 change 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	little	 a 	 s 	 	the	virus	 mut 	 ates 	 	.
It	's	like	,	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	virus	 change 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 clothe 	 s 	 	,	it	's	still	 wear 	 ing 	 	the	same	 sock 	 s 	 	,	and	now	our	job	is	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	we	get	the	body	to	 re 	 ally 	 	hate	 t 	 hose 	 	 sock 	 s 	 	.
So	what	we	've	got	is	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
The	Thai	 result 	 s 	 	tell	us	we	can	make	an	AIDS	 vaccin 	 e 	 	,	and	the	 anti 	 body 	 	 find 	 ing 	 s 	 	tell	us	how	we	might	do	that	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	,	 work 	 ing 	 	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	from	an	 anti 	 body 	 	to	create	a	 vaccin 	 e 	 	 candid 	 ate 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	never	 be 	 en 	 	 d 	 one 	 	before	in	 vaccin 	 e 	 	research	.
It	's	 call 	 ed 	 	 retro 	 - 	 vaccin 	 ology 	 	,	and	 it 	 s 	 	 implic 	 ations 	 	extend	way	beyond	that	of	just	HIV	.
So	think	of	it	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
We	've	got	these	new	 anti 	 bodies 	 	we	've	identified	,	and	we	know	that	they	latch	onto	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 vari 	 ations 	 	of	the	virus	.
We	know	that	they	have	to	latch	onto	a	specific	part	,	so	if	we	can	figure	out	the	precise	structure	of	that	part	,	present	that	through	a	 vaccin 	 e 	 	,	what	we	hope	is	we	can	prompt	your	 immun 	 e 	 	system	to	make	these	 match 	 ing 	 	 anti 	 bodies 	 	.
And	that	would	create	a	universal	HIV	 vaccin 	 e 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	it	 sound 	 s 	 	 eas 	 ier 	 	than	it	is	 be 	 cause 	 	the	structure	 actual 	 ly 	 	 look 	 s 	 	more	like	 th 	 is 	 	blue	 anti 	 body 	 	 dia 	 gram 	 	 attach 	 ed 	 	to	 it 	 s 	 	yellow	 bind 	 ing 	 	 s 	 ite 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	imagine	,	these	 three 	 - 	 dimensional 	 	 structure 	 s 	 	are	much	 hard 	 er 	 	to	work	on	.
And	if	you	 guy 	 s 	 	have	 idea 	 s 	 	to	help	us	solve	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	'd	love	to	hear	about	it	.
But	,	you	know	,	the	research	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 occur 	 red 	 	from	HIV	now	 ha 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 help 	 ed 	 	with	 innov 	 ation 	 	with	other	 disease 	 s 	 	.
So	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	a	 bio 	 technology 	 	company	 ha 	 s 	 	now	found	 broad 	 ly 	 	 neutral 	 izing 	 	 anti 	 bodies 	 	to	influenza	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	a	new	 anti 	 body 	 	target	on	the	flu	virus	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	 current 	 ly 	 	making	a	 cock 	 tail 	 	--	an	 anti 	 body 	 	 cock 	 tail 	 	--	that	can	be	used	to	treat	severe	,	 overwhelm 	 ing 	 	 case 	 s 	 	of	flu	.
In	the	 long 	 er 	 	term	,	what	they	can	do	is	use	these	 tool 	 s 	 	of	 retro 	 - 	 vaccin 	 ology 	 	to	make	a	 prevent 	 ive 	 	flu	 vaccin 	 e 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	 retro 	 - 	 vaccin 	 ology 	 	is	just	one	 techni 	 que 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	ambit	of	 so 	 - 	 call 	 ed 	 	rational	 vaccin 	 e 	 	design	.
Let	me	give	you	 an 	 other 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
We	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	before	the	H	and	N	 spike 	 s 	 	on	the	surface	of	the	flu	virus	.
 Not 	 ice 	 	these	other	,	 small 	 er 	 	 pro 	 tub 	 er 	 ance 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	 large 	 ly 	 	 hid 	 den 	 	from	the	 immun 	 e 	 	system	.
 N 	 ow 	 	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	these	 spot 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	do	n't	change	much	when	the	virus	 mut 	 ates 	 	.
If	you	can	 c 	 ripple 	 	these	with	specific	 anti 	 bodies 	 	,	you	could	 c 	 ripple 	 	all	 version 	 s 	 	of	the	flu	.
So	far	,	animal	 test 	 s 	 	 indic 	 ate 	 	that	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 vaccin 	 e 	 	could	prevent	severe	disease	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	you	might	get	a	mild	case	.
So	if	 th 	 is 	 	 work 	 s 	 	in	 human 	 s 	 	,	what	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	is	a	universal	flu	 vaccin 	 e 	 	,	one	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	need	to	change	every	year	and	would	 re 	 move 	 	the	threat	of	death	.
We	 re 	 ally 	 	could	think	of	flu	,	then	,	 a 	 s 	 	just	a	bad	cold	.
Of	course	,	the	best	 vaccin 	 e 	 	 imagin 	 able 	 	is	 on 	 ly 	 	 valu 	 able 	 	to	the	 ex 	 tent 	 	we	get	it	to	 every 	 one 	 	who	 need 	 s 	 	it	.
So	to	do	that	,	we	have	to	combine	smart	 vaccin 	 e 	 	design	with	smart	production	 method 	 s 	 	and	,	of	course	,	smart	 deliver 	 y 	 	 method 	 s 	 	.
So	I	want	you	to	think	back	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	ago	.
In	 Ju 	 ne 	 	,	the	World	Health	 Organ 	 ization 	 	 declare 	 d 	 	the	first	global	flu	 pan 	 demic 	 	in	41	 year 	 s 	 	.
The	U.S.	government	 promise 	 d 	 	150	million	 dose 	 s 	 	of	 vaccin 	 e 	 	by	 Oct 	 ob 	 er 	 	15th	for	the	flu	peak	.
 Vacci 	 nes 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 promise 	 d 	 	to	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	.
 Hundred 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 pent 	 	and	 flow 	 ed 	 	to	 accele 	 rating 	 	 vaccin 	 e 	 	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	.
So	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	?
Well	,	we	first	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	how	to	make	flu	 vaccin 	 es 	 	,	how	to	produce	them	,	in	the	early	1940s	.
It	was	a	 s 	 low 	 	,	 cum 	 ber 	 some 	 	process	that	 depend 	 ed 	 	on	chicken	 egg 	 s 	 	,	 million 	 s 	 	of	living	chicken	 egg 	 s 	 	.
 Virus 	 es 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	grow	in	living	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	so	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	that	,	for	flu	,	chicken	 egg 	 s 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	well	.
For	most	 s 	 train 	 s 	 	,	you	could	get	one	to	two	 dose 	 s 	 	of	 vaccin 	 e 	 	per	egg	.
 Luc 	 ki 	 ly 	 	for	us	,	we	live	in	an	era	of	 breath 	 taking 	 	 bio 	 medical 	 	 advance 	 s 	 	.
So	 to 	 day 	 	,	we	get	our	flu	 vaccin 	 es 	 	from	...
chicken	 egg 	 s 	 	,	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	chicken	 egg 	 s 	 	.
 Al 	 most 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	.
The	system	is	 reli 	 able 	 	but	the	problem	is	you	never	know	how	well	a	 s 	 train 	 	is	going	to	grow	.
 Th 	 is 	 	year	's	 s 	 wine 	 	flu	 s 	 train 	 	grew	 ver 	 y 	 	 poor 	 ly 	 	in	early	production	:	 bas 	 ically 	 	.6	 dose 	 s 	 	per	egg	.
So	,	here	's	an	 alarm 	 ing 	 	thought	.
What	if	that	wild	bird	flies	by	 aga 	 in 	 	?
You	could	see	an	 av 	 ian 	 	 s 	 train 	 	that	would	infect	the	 po 	 ul 	 try 	 	 flock 	 s 	 	,	and	then	we	would	have	no	 egg 	 s 	 	for	our	 vaccin 	 es 	 	.
So	,	Dan	[	 Bar 	 ber 	 	]	,	if	you	want	 billion 	 s 	 	of	chicken	 pel 	 lets 	 	for	your	fish	farm	,	I	know	where	to	get	them	.
So	right	now	,	the	world	can	produce	about	350	million	 dose 	 s 	 	of	flu	 vaccin 	 e 	 	for	the	three	 s 	 train 	 s 	 	,	and	we	can	up	that	to	about	1.2	billion	 dose 	 s 	 	if	we	want	to	target	a	single	 vari 	 ant 	 	like	 s 	 wine 	 	flu	.
But	 th 	 is 	 	 assum 	 es 	 	that	our	 factor 	 ies 	 	are	humming	 be 	 cause 	 	,	in	2004	,	the	U.S.	supply	was	cut	in	half	by	 contami 	 nation 	 	at	one	single	plant	.
And	the	process	still	 take 	 s 	 	more	than	half	a	year	.
So	are	we	better	prepared	than	we	 we 	 re 	 	in	1918	?
Well	,	with	the	new	 techno 	 logies 	 	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	now	,	I	hope	we	can	say	 definitive 	 ly 	 	,	``	Yes	.	''
 Imagin 	 e 	 	we	could	produce	 en 	 ough 	 	flu	 vaccin 	 e 	 	for	 every 	 one 	 	in	the	entire	world	for	less	than	half	of	what	we	're	 current 	 ly 	 	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	now	in	the	 Unit 	 ed 	 	 Stat 	 es 	 	.
With	a	range	of	new	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	we	could	.
 He 	 re 	 	's	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	:	A	company	I	'm	 engag 	 ed 	 	with	 ha 	 s 	 	found	a	specific	piece	of	the	H	spike	of	flu	that	 spark 	 s 	 	the	 immun 	 e 	 	system	.
If	you	lop	 th 	 is 	 	off	and	attach	it	to	the	tail	of	a	different	 bacter 	 ium 	 	,	which	 create 	 s 	 	a	 vigor 	 ous 	 	 immun 	 e 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	,	they	've	 create 	 d 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	flu	 fight 	 er 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 vaccin 	 e 	 	is	so	small	it	can	be	grown	in	a	common	bacteria	,	E.	coli	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	know	,	bacteria	 re 	 produce 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	--	it	's	like	making	yogurt	--	and	so	we	could	produce	 en 	 ough 	 	 s 	 wine 	 	origin	flu	for	the	entire	world	in	a	few	 factor 	 ies 	 	,	in	a	few	 week 	 s 	 	,	with	no	 egg 	 s 	 	,	for	a	fraction	of	the	cost	of	current	 method 	 s 	 	.
So	here	's	a	 compar 	 ison 	 	of	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	of	these	new	 vaccin 	 e 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	.
And	,	 a 	 side 	 	from	the	 radical 	 ly 	 	 in 	 crease 	 d 	 	production	and	huge	cost	 saving 	 s 	 	--	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	the	E.	coli	method	I	just	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	--	look	at	the	time	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	:	 th 	 is 	 	would	be	 live 	 s 	 	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	.
The	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	,	 most 	 ly 	 	left	out	of	the	current	 respons 	 e 	 	,	 s 	 ees 	 	the	potential	of	these	alternate	 techno 	 logies 	 	and	they	're	 leapfrog 	 ging 	 	the	West	.
India	,	Mexico	and	 other 	 s 	 	are	 al 	 ready 	 	making	 experiment 	 al 	 	flu	 vaccin 	 es 	 	,	and	they	may	be	the	first	place	we	see	these	 vaccin 	 es 	 	in	use	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	these	 techno 	 logies 	 	are	so	efficient	and	 relat 	 ively 	 	cheap	,	 billion 	 s 	 	of	people	can	have	access	to	 life 	 saving 	 	 vaccin 	 es 	 	if	we	can	figure	out	how	to	deliver	them	.
 N 	 ow 	 	think	of	where	 th 	 is 	 	 lead 	 s 	 	us	.
New	 infect 	 ious 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	appear	or	 re 	 appear 	 	every	few	 year 	 s 	 	.
Some	day	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	soon	,	we	'll	have	a	virus	that	is	going	to	threaten	all	of	us	.
Will	we	be	quick	 en 	 ough 	 	to	react	before	 million 	 s 	 	die	?
 Luc 	 ki 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	year	's	flu	was	 relat 	 ively 	 	mild	.
I	say	,	``	 luck 	 ily 	 	''	in	part	 be 	 cause 	 	 virtual 	 ly 	 	no	one	in	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	was	 vaccin 	 ated 	 	.
So	if	we	have	the	 politic 	 al 	 	and	financial	 fore 	 sight 	 	to	sustain	our	 invest 	 ments 	 	,	we	will	master	these	and	new	 tool 	 s 	 	of	 vaccin 	 ology 	 	,	and	with	these	 tool 	 s 	 	we	can	produce	 en 	 ough 	 	 vaccin 	 e 	 	for	 every 	 one 	 	at	low	cost	and	ensure	 health 	 y 	 	productive	 live 	 s 	 	.
No	 long 	 er 	 	must	flu	have	to	kill	half	a	million	people	a	year	.
No	 long 	 er 	 	 do 	 es 	 	AIDS	need	to	kill	two	million	a	year	.
No	 long 	 er 	 	do	the	poor	and	 vulner 	 able 	 	need	to	be	 threaten 	 ed 	 	by	 infect 	 ious 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	,	or	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	 any 	 body 	 	.
 In 	 stead 	 	of	 hav 	 ing 	 	 Vac 	 lav 	 	Smil	's	``	 massive 	 ly 	 	fatal	 dis 	 continu 	 ity 	 	''	of	life	,	we	can	ensure	the	 continu 	 ity 	 	of	life	.
What	the	world	 need 	 s 	 	now	are	these	new	 vaccin 	 es 	 	,	and	we	can	make	it	happen	.
Thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
Chris	 And 	 er 	 son 	 	:	Thank	you	.
Thank	you	.
So	,	the	science	is	changing	.
In	your	mind	,	 Se 	 th 	 	--	I	mean	,	you	must	dream	about	 th 	 is 	 	--	what	is	the	kind	of	time	scale	on	,	let	's	start	with	HIV	,	for	a	 game 	 - 	 changing 	 	 vaccin 	 e 	 	that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	out	there	and	 us 	 able 	 	?
 S 	 B 	 	:	The	game	change	can	come	at	any	time	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	problem	we	have	now	is	we	've	 show 	 n 	 	we	can	get	a	 vaccin 	 e 	 	to	work	in	 human 	 s 	 	;	we	just	need	a	better	one	.
And	with	these	 type 	 s 	 	of	 anti 	 bodies 	 	,	we	know	 human 	 s 	 	can	make	them	.
So	,	if	we	can	figure	out	how	to	do	that	,	then	we	have	the	 vaccin 	 e 	 	,	and	what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	is	there	 al 	 ready 	 	is	some	evidence	that	we	're	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	crack	that	problem	.
So	,	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	is	full	speed	 a 	 head 	 	.
CA	:	In	your	gut	,	do	you	think	it	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	going	to	be	at	 l 	 east 	 	 an 	 other 	 	five	 year 	 s 	 	?
 S 	 B 	 	:	You	know	,	 every 	 body 	 	 say 	 s 	 	it	's	10	 year 	 s 	 	,	but	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	10	 year 	 s 	 	every	10	 year 	 s 	 	.
So	I	hate	to	put	a	 time 	 line 	 	on	scientific	 innov 	 ation 	 	,	but	the	 invest 	 ments 	 	that	have	 occur 	 red 	 	are	now	 pay 	 ing 	 	 divid 	 end 	 s 	 	.
CA	:	And	that	's	the	same	with	universal	flu	 vaccin 	 e 	 	,	the	same	kind	of	thing	?
 S 	 B 	 	:	I	think	flu	is	different	.	I	think	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	with	flu	is	we	've	got	a	bunch	--	I	just	 show 	 ed 	 	some	of	 th 	 is 	 	--	a	bunch	of	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	and	 use 	 ful 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	that	are	ready	to	go	now	.
 The 	 y 	 	look	good	.	The	problem	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	that	,	what	we	did	is	we	 invest 	 ed 	 	in	 tradition 	 al 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	what	we	 we 	 re 	 	 comfort 	 able 	 	with	.
You	 al 	 so 	 	can	use	 adjuv 	 ants 	 	,	which	are	 chemical 	 s 	 	you	mix	.
That	's	what	 Euro 	 pe 	 	is	 do 	 ing 	 	,	so	we	could	have	 di 	 lute 	 d 	 	out	our	supply	of	flu	and	made	more	 avail 	 able 	 	,	but	,	going	back	to	what	Michael	 Spect 	 er 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	the	 anti 	 - 	 vaccin 	 e 	 	crowd	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	want	that	to	happen	.
CA	:	And	malaria	's	even	further	 be 	 hind 	 	?
 S 	 B 	 	:	No	,	malaria	,	there	is	a	 candid 	 ate 	 	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 show 	 ed 	 	 e 	 ff 	 ic 	 acy 	 	in	an	 ear 	 lier 	 	trial	and	is	 current 	 ly 	 	in	phase	three	 trial 	 s 	 	now	.
It	 prob 	 ably 	 	is	n't	the	perfect	 vaccin 	 e 	 	,	but	it	's	moving	 a 	 long 	 	.
CA	:	 Se 	 th 	 	,	most	of	us	do	work	where	every	month	,	we	produce	 some 	 thing 	 	;	we	get	that	kind	of	 grat 	 ification 	 	.
You	've	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 lav 	 ing 	 	away	at	 th 	 is 	 	for	more	than	a	decade	,	and	I	 salut 	 e 	 	you	and	your	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	for	what	you	do	.
The	world	 need 	 s 	 	people	like	you	.	Thank	you	.
 S 	 B 	 	:	Thank	you	.
 Bas 	 ically 	 	,	there	's	a	major	 demo 	 graphic 	 	event	going	on	.
And	it	may	be	that	 pass 	 ing 	 	the	50	percent	urban	point	is	an	economic	 tip 	 ping 	 	point	.	So	the	world	now	is	a	map	of	 connect 	 ivity 	 	.
It	used	to	be	that	Paris	and	London	and	New	York	 we 	 re 	 	the	largest	cities	.
What	we	have	now	is	the	end	of	the	rise	of	the	West	.	That	's	over	.
The	 aggreg 	 ate 	 	 number 	 s 	 	are	 overwhelm 	 ing 	 	.
So	what	's	 re 	 ally 	 	going	on	?	Well	,	 village 	 s 	 	of	the	world	are	 empty 	 ing 	 	out	.
The	question	is	,	why	?
And	here	's	the	 un 	 romantic 	 	truth	--	and	the	city	air	 make 	 s 	 	you	free	,	they	 s 	 aid 	 	in	 Ren 	 aiss 	 ance 	 	 German 	 y 	 	.	So	some	people	go	to	 place 	 s 	 	like	 Sha 	 n 	 ghai 	 	but	most	go	to	the	 squat 	 ter 	 	cities	where	 aesthetic 	 s 	 	rule	.
And	these	are	not	 re 	 ally 	 	a	people	 oppress 	 ed 	 	by	poverty	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	people	 get 	 ting 	 	out	of	poverty	 a 	 s 	 	fast	 a 	 s 	 	they	can	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	the	 domin 	 ant 	 	 build 	 ers 	 	and	to	a	large	 ex 	 tent 	 	,	the	 domin 	 ant 	 	 design 	 ers 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	have	 home 	 - 	 brew 	 ed 	 	 infra 	 structure 	 	and	 vib 	 rant 	 	urban	life	.
 One 	 - 	 sixth 	 	of	the	 G 	 DP 	 	in	India	is	coming	out	of	Mumbai	.
 The 	 y 	 	are	 constant 	 ly 	 	 up 	 grad 	 ing 	 	,	and	in	a	few	 case 	 s 	 	,	the	government	 help 	 s 	 	.
 Educ 	 ation 	 	is	the	main	event	that	can	happen	in	cities	.
What	's	going	on	in	the	street	in	Mumbai	?
Al	 Go 	 re 	 	 know 	 s 	 	.	It	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	.
There	's	no	 un 	 employ 	 ment 	 	in	 squat 	 ter 	 	cities	.	 Every 	 one 	 	 work 	 s 	 	.
 One 	 - 	 sixth 	 	of	 human 	 ity 	 	is	there	.	It	's	soon	going	to	be	more	than	that	.
So	here	's	the	first	punch	line	:	cities	have	 de 	 fused 	 	the	population	bomb	.
And	here	's	the	second	punch	line	.
That	's	the	news	from	 down 	 town 	 	.	 He 	 re 	 	it	is	in	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	.
 Star 	 s 	 	have	 shin 	 ed 	 	down	on	earth	's	life	for	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	we	're	 shin 	 ing 	 	right	back	up	.
Thank	you	.
Well	,	first	of	all	,	let	me	thank	Emeka	--	 a 	 s 	 	a	matter	of	fact	,	TED	Global	--	for	 put 	 ting 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	together	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	is	going	to	rank	 a 	 s 	 	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	in	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	the	21st	century	.
Think	African	 government 	 s 	 	will	put	together	a	 con 	 ference 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	?
You	think	the	 A. 	 U 	 	.	will	put	together	a	 con 	 ference 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	?
Even	before	they	do	that	they	will	ask	for	foreign	aid	.
I	would	 al 	 so 	 	like	to	pay	 hom 	 age 	 	and	honor	to	the	TED	 Fellow 	 s 	 	 Ju 	 ne 	 	Arunga	,	 Jam 	 es 	 	 Shi 	 kwati 	 	,	 Andre 	 w 	 	,	and	the	other	TED	 Fellow 	 s 	 	.
I	call	them	the	Cheetah	 Gene 	 ration 	 	.
The	Cheetah	 Gene 	 ration 	 	is	a	new	breed	of	 African 	 s 	 	who	brook	no	 non 	 sense 	 	about	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	understand	what	 account 	 ability 	 	and	 demo 	 cracy 	 	is	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	not	going	to	wait	for	government	to	do	 thing 	 s 	 	for	them	.
That	's	the	Cheetah	 Gene 	 ration 	 	,	and	 Afri 	 ca 	 	's	 salv 	 ation 	 	 rest 	 s 	 	on	the	 back 	 s 	 	of	these	 Cheetah 	 s 	 	.
In	contrast	,	of	course	,	we	have	the	Hippo	 Gene 	 ration 	 	.
The	Hippo	 Gene 	 ration 	 	are	the	 rul 	 ing 	 	 elite 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	are	 s 	 tuck 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	intellectual	patch	.
 Com 	 plain 	 ing 	 	about	 colonial 	 ism 	 	and	 imperial 	 ism 	 	,	they	would	n't	move	one	foot	.
If	you	ask	them	to	reform	the	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	,	they	're	not	going	to	reform	it	 be 	 cause 	 	they	benefit	from	the	 rot 	 ten 	 	 stat 	 us 	 	quo	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	there	are	a	lot	of	 African 	 s 	 	who	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 ang 	 ry 	 	,	 ang 	 ry 	 	at	the	condition	of	 Afri 	 ca 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	a	continent	that	is	not	poor	.
It	is	rich	in	mineral	 resource 	 s 	 	,	natural	mineral	 resource 	 s 	 	.
But	the	mineral	wealth	of	 Afri 	 ca 	 	is	not	 be 	 ing 	 	 util 	 ized 	 	to	lift	 it 	 s 	 	people	out	of	poverty	.
That	's	what	 make 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	 African 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 ang 	 ry 	 	.
And	in	a	way	,	 Afri 	 ca 	 	is	more	than	a	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	,	in	more	ways	than	one	.
There	's	 an 	 other 	 	 endur 	 ing 	 	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	,	and	that	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	is	that	there	are	so	 man 	 y 	 	people	,	so	 man 	 y 	 	 government 	 s 	 	,	so	 man 	 y 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	who	want	to	help	the	people	in	 Afri 	 ca 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	do	n't	understand	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	we	're	not	 say 	 ing 	 	do	n't	help	 Afri 	 ca 	 	.
 Help 	 ing 	 	 Afri 	 ca 	 	is	noble	.
But	 help 	 ing 	 	 Afri 	 ca 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	theater	of	the	absurd	.
It	's	like	the	blind	 lead 	 ing 	 	the	 clue 	 less 	 	.
There	are	certain	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	need	to	 recogn 	 ize 	 	.
 Afri 	 ca 	 	's	 beg 	 ging 	 - 	 bowl 	 	 leak 	 s 	 	.
Did	you	know	that	40	percent	of	the	wealth	 create 	 d 	 	in	 Afri 	 ca 	 	is	not	 invest 	 ed 	 	here	in	 Afri 	 ca 	 	?
It	's	taken	out	of	 Afri 	 ca 	 	.
That	's	what	the	World	Bank	 say 	 s 	 	.
Look	at	 Afri 	 ca 	 	's	 beg 	 ging 	 - 	 bowl 	 	.
It	 leak 	 s 	 	 horr 	 ibly 	 	.
There	are	people	who	think	that	we	should	pour	more	money	,	more	aid	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	bowl	which	 leak 	 s 	 	.
What	are	the	 leak 	 age 	 s 	 	?
 Cor 	 rup 	 tion 	 	 al 	 one 	 	 cost 	 s 	 	 Afri 	 ca 	 	148	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	year	.
Yes	,	put	that	 a 	 side 	 	.
 Cap 	 ital 	 	flight	out	of	 Afri 	 ca 	 	,	80	billion	a	year	.
Put	that	 a 	 side 	 	.
Let	's	take	food	 import 	 s 	 	.
Every	year	 Afri 	 ca 	 	 s 	 pend 	 s 	 	20	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	to	import	food	.
Just	add	that	up	,	all	these	 leak 	 age 	 s 	 	.
That	's	far	more	than	the	50	billion	 T 	 ony 	 	Blair	 want 	 s 	 	to	raise	for	 Afri 	 ca 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	back	in	the	1960s	 Afri 	 ca 	 	not	 on 	 ly 	 	fed	 it 	 self 	 	,	it	 al 	 so 	 	 export 	 ed 	 	food	.
Not	 any 	 more 	 	.
We	know	that	 some 	 thing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	gone	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	wrong	.
You	know	it	,	I	know	it	,	but	let	's	not	waste	our	time	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	these	 mistak 	 es 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	'll	 s 	 pend 	 	all	day	here	.
Let	's	move	on	,	and	flip	over	to	the	next	chapter	,	and	that	's	what	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	is	all	about	--	the	next	chapter	.
The	next	chapter	 begin 	 s 	 	with	first	of	all	,	 ask 	 ing 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	 th 	 is 	 	fundamental	question	,	``	 W 	 hom 	 	do	we	want	to	help	in	 Afri 	 ca 	 	?	''
There	is	the	people	,	and	then	there	is	the	government	or	 lead 	 ers 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	the	previous	speaker	before	me	,	Idris	 Mo 	 ham 	 med 	 	,	 indic 	 ated 	 	that	we	've	had	 a 	 by 	 s 	 mal 	 	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	in	 Afri 	 ca 	 	.
That	 character 	 ization 	 	,	in	my	view	,	is	even	more	 char 	 it 	 able 	 	.
I	belong	to	an	Internet	 discuss 	 ion 	 	forum	,	an	African	Internet	 discuss 	 ion 	 	forum	,	and	I	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	,	I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Since	1960	,	we	've	had	 exact 	 ly 	 	204	African	 head 	 s 	 	of	state	,	since	1960	.	''
And	I	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	to	name	me	just	20	good	 lead 	 ers 	 	,	just	20	good	 lead 	 ers 	 	--	you	may	want	to	take	 th 	 is 	 	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	 challeng 	 e 	 	 your 	 self 	 	.
I	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	to	name	me	just	20	.
 Every 	 body 	 	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	 Nel 	 son 	 	 Man 	 del 	 a 	 	,	of	course	.
 Kwa 	 me 	 	Nkrumah	,	 Nye 	 re 	 re 	 	,	 Kenya 	 tta 	 	--	 some 	 body 	 	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	 I 	 di 	 	 A 	 min 	 	.
I	let	that	pass	.
My	point	is	,	they	could	n't	go	beyond	15	.
Even	if	they	had	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	name	me	20	,	what	 do 	 es 	 	that	tell	you	?
20	out	of	204	 mean 	 s 	 	that	the	vast	 major 	 ity 	 	of	the	African	 lead 	 ers 	 	 fail 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	people	.
And	if	you	look	at	them	,	the	 s 	 late 	 	of	the	 post 	 - 	 colonial 	 	 lead 	 ers 	 	--	an	 assort 	 ment 	 	of	 militar 	 y 	 	 fu 	 fu 	 	 head 	 s 	 	,	 Swiss 	 - 	 bank 	 	 social 	 ists 	 	,	crocodile	 liber 	 ators 	 	,	vampire	 elite 	 s 	 	,	 qu 	 ack 	 	 revolution 	 aries 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	is	a	far	cry	from	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	 lead 	 ers 	 	that	 African 	 s 	 	have	known	for	centuries	.
The	second	false	 pre 	 mise 	 	that	we	make	when	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	help	 Afri 	 ca 	 	is	that	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	we	think	that	there	is	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	a	government	in	 Afri 	 ca 	 	that	 care 	 s 	 	about	 it 	 s 	 	people	,	 serve 	 s 	 	the	 interest 	 s 	 	of	the	people	,	and	 represent 	 s 	 	the	people	.
There	is	one	 part 	 icular 	 	quote	--	a	 Les 	 oth 	 o 	 	chief	once	 s 	 aid 	 	that	``	 He 	 re 	 	in	 Les 	 oth 	 o 	 	,	we	've	got	two	 problem 	 s 	 	:	 rat 	 s 	 	and	the	government	.	''
What	you	and	I	understand	 a 	 s 	 	a	government	 do 	 es 	 	n't	exist	in	 man 	 y 	 	African	 count 	 ries 	 	.
In	fact	,	what	we	call	our	 government 	 s 	 	are	vampire	 state 	 s 	 	.
 Vampire 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	suck	the	economic	 vital 	 ity 	 	out	of	 the 	 ir 	 	people	.
Government	is	the	problem	in	 Afri 	 ca 	 	.
A	vampire	state	is	the	government	--	--	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 hijack 	 ed 	 	by	a	 phal 	 anx 	 	of	 bandit 	 s 	 	and	 crook 	 s 	 	who	use	the	 instrument 	 s 	 	of	state	power	to	enrich	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 cr 	 onies 	 	,	and	 tribe 	 s 	 men 	 	and	exclude	 every 	 body 	 	else	.
The	 rich 	 est 	 	people	in	 Afri 	 ca 	 	are	 head 	 s 	 - 	 of 	 - 	 state 	 	and	 mini 	 sters 	 	,	and	 quit 	 e 	 	often	the	chief	bandit	is	the	 head 	 - 	 of 	 - 	 state 	 	 him 	 self 	 	.
Where	do	they	get	 the 	 ir 	 	money	?
By	creating	wealth	?
No	.
By	 rak 	 ing 	 	it	off	the	 back 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 suffer 	 ing 	 	people	.
That	's	not	wealth	creation	.	It	's	wealth	 re 	 distribut 	 ion 	 	.
The	third	fundamental	issue	that	we	have	to	 recogn 	 ize 	 	is	that	if	we	want	to	help	the	African	people	,	we	must	know	where	the	African	people	are	.
Take	any	African	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
An	African	 eco 	 nomy 	 	can	be	broken	up	 in 	 to 	 	three	 sector 	 s 	 	.
There	is	the	modern	sector	,	there	is	the	 inform 	 al 	 	sector	and	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	sector	.
The	modern	sector	is	the	 abo 	 de 	 	of	the	 elite 	 s 	 	.
It	's	the	seat	of	government	.
In	 man 	 y 	 	African	 count 	 ries 	 	the	modern	sector	is	lost	.
It	's	 dy 	 s 	 functional 	 	.
It	is	a	 mere 	 tric 	 ious 	 	 fan 	 dan 	 go 	 	of	 import 	 ed 	 	 system 	 s 	 	,	which	the	 elite 	 s 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	do	n't	understand	.
That	is	the	source	of	 man 	 y 	 	of	 Afri 	 ca 	 	's	 problem 	 s 	 	where	the	 struggle 	 s 	 	for	 politic 	 al 	 	power	emanate	and	then	 s 	 pill 	 	over	onto	the	 inform 	 al 	 	and	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	sector	,	 claim 	 ing 	 	 innoc 	 ent 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	the	modern	sector	,	of	course	,	is	where	a	lot	of	the	 develop 	 ment 	 	aid	and	 resource 	 s 	 	went	 in 	 to 	 	.
 Mo 	 re 	 	than	80	percent	of	 Ivo 	 ry 	 	Coast	's	 develop 	 ment 	 	went	 in 	 to 	 	the	modern	sector	.
The	other	 sector 	 s 	 	,	the	 inform 	 al 	 	and	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	 sector 	 s 	 	,	are	where	you	find	the	 major 	 ity 	 	of	the	African	people	,	the	real	people	in	 Afri 	 ca 	 	.	That	's	where	you	find	them	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	it	 make 	 s 	 	common	sense	that	if	you	want	to	help	the	people	,	you	go	where	the	people	are	.
But	that	's	not	what	we	did	.
 A 	 s 	 	a	matter	of	fact	,	we	 neglect 	 ed 	 	the	 inform 	 al 	 	and	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	 sector 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	 tradition 	 al 	 	sector	is	where	 Afri 	 ca 	 	 produce 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 agricultur 	 e 	 	,	which	is	one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	why	 Afri 	 ca 	 	ca	n't	feed	 it 	 self 	 	,	and	that	's	why	it	must	import	food	.
All	right	,	you	can	not	develop	 Afri 	 ca 	 	by	 ignor 	 ing 	 	the	 inform 	 al 	 	and	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	 sector 	 s 	 	.
And	you	ca	n't	develop	the	 inform 	 al 	 	and	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	 sector 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	an	 operation 	 al 	 	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	how	these	two	 sector 	 s 	 	work	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	two	 sector 	 s 	 	,	let	me	 de 	 scribe 	 	to	you	,	have	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 indi 	 genous 	 	 institution 	 s 	 	.
First	one	is	the	 politic 	 al 	 	system	.
 Tradition 	 ally 	 	,	 African 	 s 	 	hate	 government 	 s 	 	.	 The 	 y 	 	hate	 tyrann 	 y 	 	.
If	you	look	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 tradition 	 al 	 	 system 	 s 	 	,	 African 	 s 	 	organize	 the 	 ir 	 	 state 	 s 	 	in	two	 type 	 s 	 	.
The	first	one	 belong 	 s 	 	to	 t 	 hose 	 	ethnic	 socie 	 ties 	 	who	 believ 	 e 	 	that	the	state	was	 necess 	 arily 	 	 tyrann 	 ous 	 	,	so	they	did	n't	want	to	have	 any 	 thing 	 	to	do	with	any	 central 	 ized 	 	 author 	 ity 	 	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	 socie 	 ties 	 	are	the	 I 	 bo 	 	,	the	Somali	,	the	Kikuyus	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	.	 The 	 y 	 	have	no	 chief 	 s 	 	.
The	other	ethnic	 group 	 s 	 	,	which	did	have	 chief 	 s 	 	,	made	 s 	 ure 	 	that	they	 surround 	 ed 	 	the	 chief 	 s 	 	with	 council 	 s 	 	 up 	 on 	 	 council 	 s 	 	 up 	 on 	 	 council 	 s 	 	to	prevent	them	from	 ab 	 using 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	power	.
In	 Ash 	 anti 	 	tradition	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	the	chief	can	not	make	any	decision	 with 	 out 	 	the	 con 	 curr 	 ence 	 	of	the	council	of	 elder 	 s 	 	.
 With 	 out 	 	the	council	the	chief	ca	n't	pass	any	law	,	and	if	the	chief	 do 	 es 	 	n't	govern	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	the	will	of	the	people	he	will	be	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	.
If	not	,	the	people	will	abandon	the	chief	,	go	 some 	 where 	 	else	and	set	up	a	new	 settle 	 ment 	 	.
And	even	if	you	look	in	ancient	African	 empire 	 s 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	all	 organize 	 d 	 	around	one	 part 	 icular 	 	principle	--	the	 con 	 fed 	 er 	 acy 	 	principle	,	which	is	 character 	 ized 	 	by	a	great	deal	of	 d 	 evolution 	 	of	 author 	 ity 	 	,	 de 	 central 	 ization 	 	of	power	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	I	have	 de 	 scribed 	 	to	you	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	part	of	 Afri 	 ca 	 	's	 indi 	 genous 	 	 politic 	 al 	 	heritage	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	 compar 	 e 	 	that	to	the	modern	 system 	 s 	 	the	 rul 	 ing 	 	 elite 	 s 	 	 establish 	 ed 	 	on	 Afri 	 ca 	 	.
It	is	a	total	far	cry	.
In	the	economic	system	in	 tradition 	 al 	 	 Afri 	 ca 	 	,	the	 mean 	 s 	 	of	production	is	 private 	 ly 	 	owned	.
It	's	owned	by	 extend 	 ed 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	.
You	see	,	in	the	West	,	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	economic	and	social	unit	is	the	individual	.
The	American	will	say	,	``	I	am	 be 	 cause 	 	I	am	,	and	I	can	damn	well	do	 any 	 thing 	 	I	want	,	 any 	 time 	 	.	''
The	accent	is	on	the	``	I	.	''
In	 Afri 	 ca 	 	,	the	 African 	 s 	 	say	,	``	I	am	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	are	.	''
The	``	we	''	 con 	 note 	 s 	 	community	--	the	 extend 	 ed 	 	family	system	.
The	 extend 	 ed 	 	family	system	 pool 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	together	.
 The 	 y 	 	own	 farm 	 s 	 	.	 The 	 y 	 	decide	what	to	do	,	what	to	produce	.
 The 	 y 	 	do	n't	take	any	 order 	 s 	 	from	 the 	 ir 	 	 chief 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	decide	what	to	do	.
And	when	they	produce	 the 	 ir 	 	 crop 	 s 	 	,	they	sell	the	 sur 	 plus 	 	on	 market 	 place 	 s 	 	.
When	they	make	a	profit	it	is	 the 	 ir 	 s 	 	to	keep	,	not	for	the	chief	to	 sequest 	 er 	 	it	from	them	.
So	,	in	a	 nut 	 shell 	 	,	what	we	had	in	 tradition 	 al 	 	 Afri 	 ca 	 	was	a	 free 	 - 	 market 	 	system	.
There	 we 	 re 	 	 market 	 s 	 	in	 Afri 	 ca 	 	before	the	 colonial 	 ists 	 	 steppe 	 d 	 	foot	on	the	continent	.
 Tim 	 buktu 	 	was	one	great	big	market	town	.
 Ka 	 no 	 	,	 Sal 	 aga 	 	--	they	 we 	 re 	 	all	there	.
Even	if	you	go	to	West	 Afri 	 ca 	 	,	you	notice	that	market	activity	in	West	 Afri 	 ca 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 dominate 	 d 	 	by	women	.
So	,	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	appropriate	that	 th 	 is 	 	section	is	 call 	 ed 	 	a	 market 	 place 	 	.
The	market	is	not	alien	to	 Afri 	 ca 	 	.
What	 African 	 s 	 	 practice 	 d 	 	was	a	different	form	of	 capital 	 ism 	 	,	but	then	after	 in 	 depend 	 ence 	 	,	all	of	a	sudden	,	 market 	 s 	 	,	 capital 	 ism 	 	 be 	 came 	 	a	western	institution	,	and	the	 lead 	 ers 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	 African 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	ready	for	 social 	 ism 	 	.
 Non 	 sense 	 	.
And	even	then	,	what	kind	of	 social 	 ism 	 	did	they	practice	?
The	 social 	 ism 	 	that	they	 practice 	 d 	 	was	a	peculiar	form	of	 Swiss 	 - 	 bank 	 	 social 	 ism 	 	,	which	 allow 	 ed 	 	the	 head 	 s 	 	of	 state 	 s 	 	and	the	 mini 	 sters 	 	to	rape	and	plunder	 Afri 	 ca 	 	's	 treasu 	 ries 	 	for	deposit	in	 Switzer 	 land 	 	.
That	is	not	the	kind	of	system	 African 	 s 	 	had	known	for	centuries	.
What	do	we	do	now	?
Go	back	to	 Afri 	 ca 	 	's	 indi 	 genous 	 	 institution 	 s 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	we	charge	the	 Cheetah 	 s 	 	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	the	 inform 	 al 	 	 sector 	 s 	 	,	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	 sector 	 s 	 	.
That	's	where	you	find	the	African	people	.
And	I	'd	like	to	show	you	a	quick	little	video	about	the	 inform 	 al 	 	sector	,	about	the	 boat 	 - 	 building 	 	that	I	,	 my 	 self 	 	,	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	mobilize	 African 	 s 	 	in	the	Diaspora	to	invest	in	.
 Cou 	 ld 	 	you	 pleas 	 e 	 	show	that	?
The	men	are	going	 fish 	 ing 	 	in	these	small	 boat 	 s 	 	.
Yes	,	it	's	an	enterprise	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	by	a	local	 Ghana 	 ian 	 	entrepreneur	,	using	his	own	capital	.
He	's	 get 	 ting 	 	no	 assist 	 ance 	 	from	the	government	,	and	he	's	building	a	second	,	 big 	 ger 	 	boat	.
A	 big 	 ger 	 	boat	will	mean	more	fish	will	be	caught	and	 land 	 ed 	 	.
It	 mean 	 s 	 	that	he	will	be	able	to	employ	more	 Ghana 	 ians 	 	.
It	 al 	 so 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	that	he	will	be	able	to	generate	wealth	.
And	then	it	will	have	what	 economist 	 s 	 	call	external	 effect 	 s 	 	on	a	local	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
All	that	you	need	to	do	,	all	that	the	 elite 	 s 	 	need	to	do	,	is	to	move	 th 	 is 	 	operation	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	 en 	 closed 	 	so	that	the	operation	can	be	made	more	efficient	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	it	is	not	just	 th 	 is 	 	 inform 	 al 	 	sector	.
There	is	 al 	 so 	 	 tradition 	 al 	 	medicine	.
80	percent	of	 African 	 s 	 	still	 re 	 ly 	 	on	 tradition 	 al 	 	medicine	.
The	modern	 health 	 care 	 	sector	 ha 	 s 	 	 total 	 ly 	 	 collapse 	 d 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	area	--	I	mean	,	there	is	a	 treasu 	 re 	 	trove	of	wealth	in	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	medicine	area	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	where	we	need	to	mobilize	 African 	 s 	 	,	in	the	Diaspora	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	,	to	invest	in	 th 	 is 	 	.
We	 al 	 so 	 	need	to	mobilize	 African 	 s 	 	in	the	Diaspora	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	 sector 	 s 	 	,	but	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	 agricultur 	 e 	 	and	 al 	 so 	 	to	 in 	 stig 	 ate 	 	change	from	 with 	 in 	 	.
We	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	mobilize	 Ghana 	 ians 	 	in	the	Diaspora	to	 in 	 stig 	 ate 	 	change	in	Ghana	and	 br 	 ing 	 	about	 demo 	 cracy 	 	in	Ghana	.
And	I	know	that	with	the	 Cheetah 	 s 	 	,	we	can	take	 Afri 	 ca 	 	back	one	village	at	a	time	.
Thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
Thank	you	so	much	,	Chris	.	And	it	's	 tru 	 ly 	 	a	great	honor	to	have	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	come	to	 th 	 is 	 	stage	twice	.	I	'm	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 grat 	 e 	 ful 	 	.
I	have	 be 	 en 	 	blown	away	by	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 ference 	 	,	and	I	want	to	thank	all	of	you	for	the	 man 	 y 	 	nice	 comment 	 s 	 	about	what	I	had	to	say	the	other	night	.
And	I	say	that	 since 	 re 	 ly 	 	,	 part 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	--	--	I	need	that	!
Put	 your 	 s 	 elves 	 	in	my	position	!
I	flew	on	Air	Force	Two	for	eight	 year 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	I	have	to	take	off	my	 shoe 	 s 	 	or	 boot 	 s 	 	to	get	on	an	 air 	 plane 	 	!
I	'll	tell	you	one	quick	story	to	 illustr 	 ate 	 	what	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	like	for	me	.
It	's	a	true	story	--	every	bit	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	true	.
Soon	after	 Tip 	 per 	 	and	I	left	the	--	--	White	House	--	--	we	 we 	 re 	 	 driv 	 ing 	 	from	our	home	in	 Nash 	 ville 	 	to	a	little	farm	we	have	50	 mile 	 s 	 	east	of	 Nash 	 ville 	 	--	 driv 	 ing 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
I	know	it	 sound 	 s 	 	like	a	little	thing	to	you	,	but	--	--	I	 look 	 ed 	 	in	the	 rear 	 view 	 	mirror	and	all	of	a	sudden	it	just	hit	me	.
There	was	no	 motor 	 ca 	 de 	 	back	there	.
You	've	heard	of	phantom	limb	pain	?
 Th 	 is 	 	was	a	 rent 	 ed 	 	 For 	 d 	 	 Tau 	 rus 	 	.	It	was	 d 	 inner 	 time 	 	,	and	we	 start 	 ed 	 	looking	for	a	place	to	eat	.
We	 we 	 re 	 	on	 I 	 - 	 40 	 	.	We	got	to	 Ex 	 it 	 	238	,	 Le 	 ba 	 non 	 	,	 Ten 	 ness 	 ee 	 	.
We	got	off	the	exit	,	 start 	 ed 	 	looking	for	a	--	we	found	a	 S 	 honey 	 	's	restaurant	.
 Low 	 - 	 cost 	 	family	restaurant	chain	,	for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	do	n't	know	it	.
We	went	in	and	 s 	 at 	 	down	at	the	booth	,	and	the	 wait 	 re 	 s 	 s 	 	came	over	,	made	a	big	 com 	 motion 	 	over	 Tip 	 per 	 	.
She	took	our	order	,	and	then	went	to	the	couple	in	the	booth	next	to	us	,	and	she	 lower 	 ed 	 	her	voice	so	much	I	had	to	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 train 	 	to	hear	what	she	was	 say 	 ing 	 	.
She	 s 	 aid 	 	``	Yes	,	that	's	 form 	 er 	 	 V 	 ice 	 	 P 	 resident 	 	Al	 Go 	 re 	 	and	his	wife	 Tip 	 per 	 	.	''
And	the	man	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	He	's	come	down	a	long	way	,	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	he	?	''
There	's	 be 	 en 	 	kind	of	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 epiph 	 anie 	 s 	 	.
The	 ver 	 y 	 	next	day	,	 continu 	 ing 	 	a	 total 	 ly 	 	true	story	,	I	got	on	a	 G 	 - 	 5 	 	to	fly	to	 Afri 	 ca 	 	to	make	a	speech	in	 Niger 	 ia 	 	,	in	the	city	of	 La 	 go 	 s 	 	,	on	the	 top 	 ic 	 	of	energy	.
I	 beg 	 an 	 	the	speech	by	 tell 	 ing 	 	them	the	story	of	what	had	just	 happen 	 ed 	 	the	day	before	in	 Nash 	 ville 	 	.
I	told	it	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	the	same	way	I	've	just	 share 	 d 	 	it	with	you	:	 Tip 	 per 	 	and	I	 we 	 re 	 	 driv 	 ing 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	 S 	 honey 	 	's	,	 low 	 - 	 cost 	 	family	restaurant	chain	,	what	the	man	 s 	 aid 	 	--	they	 laugh 	 ed 	 	.
I	 g 	 ave 	 	my	speech	,	then	went	back	out	to	the	 air 	 port 	 	to	fly	back	home	.
I	fell	 a 	 sleep 	 	on	the	plane	,	 un 	 til 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	middle	of	the	night	,	we	 land 	 ed 	 	on	the	Azores	 Island 	 s 	 	for	 re 	 fuel 	 ing 	 	.
I	 wok 	 e 	 	up	,	they	 open 	 ed 	 	the	door	,	I	went	out	to	get	some	fresh	air	,	and	I	 look 	 ed 	 	and	there	was	a	man	running	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 run 	 way 	 	.
And	he	was	 wav 	 ing 	 	a	piece	of	paper	,	and	he	was	 yell 	 ing 	 	,	``	Call	 Wash 	 ington 	 	!	Call	 Wash 	 ington 	 	!	''
And	I	thought	to	 my 	 self 	 	,	in	the	middle	of	the	night	,	in	the	middle	of	the	Atlantic	,	what	in	the	world	could	be	wrong	in	 Wash 	 ington 	 	?
 Th 	 en 	 	I	 remember 	 ed 	 	it	could	be	a	bunch	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
But	what	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	to	be	was	that	my	staff	was	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 up 	 set 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	one	of	the	wire	 service 	 s 	 	in	 Niger 	 ia 	 	had	 al 	 ready 	 	written	a	story	about	my	speech	.

And	the	story	 beg 	 an 	 	,	``	 Form 	 er 	 	 V 	 ice 	 	 P 	 resident 	 	Al	 Go 	 re 	 	 announce 	 d 	 	in	 Niger 	 ia 	 	 yester 	 day 	 	,	'My	wife	 Tip 	 per 	 	and	I	have	 open 	 ed 	 	a	 low 	 - 	 cost 	 	family	restaurant	,	named	 S 	 honey 	 	's	,	and	we	are	running	it	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.

Three	 day 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	I	got	a	nice	,	long	,	 hand 	 written 	 	letter	from	my	friend	and	partner	and	 col 	 league 	 	Bill	Clinton	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	 Con 	 grat 	 ul 	 ations 	 	on	the	new	restaurant	,	Al	!	''
We	like	to	 celebr 	 ate 	 	each	other	's	 success 	 es 	 	in	life	.
I	was	going	to	talk	about	information	 eco 	 logy 	 	.
But	I	was	 think 	 ing 	 	that	since	I	plan	to	make	a	 life 	 long 	 	habit	of	coming	back	to	TED	,	that	 may 	 be 	 	I	could	talk	about	that	 an 	 other 	 	time	.
Chris	 And 	 er 	 son 	 	:	It	's	a	deal	!
Al	 Go 	 re 	 	:	I	want	to	focus	on	what	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	have	 s 	 aid 	 	you	would	like	me	to	elaborate	on	.
What	can	you	do	about	the	climate	crisis	?	I	want	to	start	with	--	I	'm	going	to	show	some	new	 image 	 s 	 	,	and	I	'm	going	to	recapitulate	just	four	or	five	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	the	slide	show	.	I	update	the	slide	show	every	time	I	give	it	.
I	add	new	 image 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	I	learn	more	about	it	every	time	I	give	it	.
It	's	like	 beach 	 comb 	 ing 	 	,	you	know	?	Every	time	the	tide	 come 	 s 	 	in	and	out	,	you	find	some	more	 shell 	 s 	 	.
Just	in	the	last	two	 day 	 s 	 	,	we	got	the	new	temperature	 record 	 s 	 	in	 Jan 	 uary 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	just	for	the	 Unit 	 ed 	 	 Stat 	 es 	 	of	America	.	 Historic 	 al 	 	average	for	 Jan 	 uary 	 	is	31	 degree 	 s 	 	.	Last	month	was	39.5	 degree 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	I	know	that	you	 want 	 ed 	 	some	more	bad	news	about	the	environment	--	I	'm	 kid 	 d 	 ing 	 	--	but	these	are	the	 re 	 cap 	 it 	 ul 	 ation 	 	 slide 	 s 	 	,	and	then	I	'm	going	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	new	material	about	what	you	can	do	.
But	I	 want 	 ed 	 	to	elaborate	on	a	couple	of	these	.
First	of	all	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	we	're	 project 	 ed 	 	to	go	with	the	U.S.	 con 	 trib 	 ution 	 	to	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	,	under	business	 a 	 s 	 	usual	.	 Effici 	 ency 	 	in	 end 	 - 	 use 	 	 electric 	 ity 	 	and	 end 	 - 	 use 	 	of	all	energy	is	the	 low 	 - 	 hang 	 ing 	 	fruit	.	 Effici 	 ency 	 	and	 conserv 	 ation 	 	:	it	's	not	a	cost	;	it	's	a	profit	.	The	sign	is	wrong	.
It	's	not	negative	;	it	's	positive	.	 Th 	 ese 	 	are	 invest 	 ments 	 	that	pay	for	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
But	they	are	 al 	 so 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	effective	in	 deflect 	 ing 	 	our	path	.
 Car 	 s 	 	and	 truck 	 s 	 	--	I	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	that	in	the	 slide 	 show 	 	,	but	I	want	you	to	put	it	in	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	.
It	's	an	easy	,	visible	target	of	concern	,	and	it	should	be	,	but	there	is	more	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	 poll 	 ution 	 	that	 come 	 s 	 	from	 building 	 s 	 	than	from	 car 	 s 	 	and	 truck 	 s 	 	.
 Car 	 s 	 	and	 truck 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	significant	,	and	we	have	the	 low 	 est 	 	 standard 	 s 	 	in	the	world	,	and	so	we	should	address	that	.	But	it	's	part	of	the	 puzzl 	 e 	 	.
Other	 transport 	 ation 	 	efficiency	is	 a 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 car 	 s 	 	and	 truck 	 s 	 	!
 Re 	 new 	 able 	 s 	 	at	the	current	 level 	 s 	 	of	 techno 	 logical 	 	efficiency	can	make	 th 	 is 	 	much	 differ 	 ence 	 	,	and	with	what	 Vi 	 nod 	 	,	and	John	 Do 	 er 	 r 	 	,	and	 other 	 s 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	here	--	a	lot	of	people	 direct 	 ly 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	wedge	is	going	to	grow	much	more	 rapid 	 ly 	 	than	the	current	 project 	 ion 	 	 show 	 s 	 	it	.
Carbon	 Cap 	 ture 	 	and	 Sequ 	 est 	 ration 	 	--	that	's	what	 CC 	 S 	 	 stand 	 s 	 	for	--	is	 like 	 ly 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	the	killer	app	that	will	 en 	 able 	 	us	to	 continu 	 e 	 	to	use	fossil	 fuel 	 s 	 	in	a	way	that	is	safe	.
Not	 quit 	 e 	 	there	yet	.
 O 	 K. 	 	 N 	 ow 	 	,	what	can	you	do	?	 Red 	 uce 	 	 e 	 mission 	 s 	 	in	your	home	.

 T 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	are	good	at	 brand 	 ing 	 	,	I	'd	love	to	get	your	 ad 	 vice 	 	and	help	on	how	to	say	 th 	 is 	 	in	a	way	that	 connect 	 s 	 	with	the	most	people	.

 Aga 	 in 	 	,	the	 Re 	 public 	 an 	 s 	 	here	,	 th 	 is 	 	should	n't	be	partisan	.

We	are	one	.
Thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	,	I	appreciate	it	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	ocean	 a 	 s 	 	I	used	to	know	it	.
And	I	find	that	since	I	've	 be 	 en 	 	in	the	Gulf	a	couple	of	 time 	 s 	 	,	I	 re 	 ally 	 	kind	of	am	 trauma 	 t 	 ized 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 when 	 ever 	 	I	look	at	the	ocean	now	,	no	matter	where	I	am	,	even	where	I	know	 non 	 e 	 	of	the	oil	 ha 	 s 	 	gone	,	I	sort	of	see	 s 	 lick 	 s 	 	,	and	I	'm	 find 	 ing 	 	that	I	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	much	 haunt 	 ed 	 	by	it	.
But	what	I	want	to	talk	to	you	about	 to 	 day 	 	is	a	lot	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	try	to	put	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	in	 con 	 text 	 	,	not	just	about	the	oil	 erupt 	 ion 	 	,	but	what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	and	why	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
First	,	just	a	little	bit	about	me	.
I	'm	 bas 	 ically 	 	just	a	guy	that	 like 	 s 	 	to	go	 fish 	 ing 	 	ever	since	I	was	a	little	kid	,	and	 be 	 cause 	 	I	did	,	I	wound	up	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	sea	 bird 	 s 	 	to	try	to	stay	in	the	 coast 	 al 	 	 habit 	 at 	 s 	 	that	I	so	 love 	 d 	 	.
And	now	I	 main 	 ly 	 	write	 book 	 s 	 	about	how	the	ocean	is	changing	,	and	the	ocean	is	 certain 	 ly 	 	changing	 ver 	 y 	 	 rapid 	 ly 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	we	saw	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	graphic	 ear 	 lier 	 	on	,	that	we	 re 	 ally 	 	live	on	a	hard	 mar 	 ble 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	just	a	 s 	 light 	 	bit	of	 wet 	 ness 	 	to	it	.
It	's	like	you	dipped	a	 mar 	 ble 	 	in	water	.
And	the	same	thing	with	the	atmosphere	:	If	you	took	all	the	atmosphere	and	 roll 	 ed 	 	it	up	in	a	ball	,	you	would	get	that	little	sphere	of	gas	on	the	right	.
So	we	live	on	the	most	fragile	,	little	soap	bubble	you	can	imagine	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	sacred	soap	bubble	,	but	one	that	is	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	easy	to	affect	.
And	all	the	 burn 	 ing 	 	of	oil	and	coal	and	gas	,	all	the	fossil	 fuel 	 s 	 	,	have	 change 	 d 	 	the	atmosphere	 great 	 ly 	 	.
Carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	level	 ha 	 s 	 	gone	up	and	up	and	up	.
We	're	 warm 	 ing 	 	the	climate	.
So	the	 blow 	 out 	 	in	the	Gulf	is	just	a	little	piece	of	a	much	 large 	 r 	 	problem	that	we	have	with	the	energy	that	we	use	to	run	 civil 	 ization 	 	.
Beyond	 warm 	 ing 	 	,	we	have	the	problem	of	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	more	 acid 	 ified 	 	--	and	 al 	 ready 	 	 measur 	 ably 	 	so	,	and	 al 	 ready 	 	 affect 	 ing 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	in	the	 labor 	 atory 	 	,	if	you	take	a	clam	and	you	put	it	in	the	pH	that	is	--	not	8.1	,	which	is	the	normal	pH	of	 sea 	 water 	 	--	but	7.5	,	it	 dis 	 solve 	 s 	 	in	about	three	 day 	 s 	 	.
If	you	take	a	sea	urchin	larva	from	8.1	,	put	it	in	a	pH	of	7.7	--	not	a	huge	change	--	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 de 	 form 	 ed 	 	and	dies	.
And	 al 	 ready 	 	,	commercial	oyster	 larva 	 e 	 	are	 dy 	 ing 	 	at	large	 scale 	 s 	 	in	some	 place 	 s 	 	.
 Cor 	 al 	 	 reef 	 s 	 	are	growing	 s 	 lower 	 	in	some	 place 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	problem	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 matter 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	let	's	take	a	little	tour	around	the	Gulf	a	little	bit	.
One	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 impress 	 es 	 	me	about	the	people	in	the	Gulf	:	 The 	 y 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 aqua 	 tic 	 	people	.
And	they	can	handle	water	.
 The 	 y 	 	can	handle	a	hurricane	that	 come 	 s 	 	and	 go 	 es 	 	.
When	the	water	 go 	 es 	 	down	,	they	know	what	to	do	.
But	when	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	other	than	water	,	and	 the 	 ir 	 	water	 habit 	 at 	 	 change 	 s 	 	,	they	do	n't	have	 man 	 y 	 	 option 	 s 	 	.
In	fact	,	 t 	 hose 	 	entire	 commun 	 ities 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	do	n't	have	 man 	 y 	 	 option 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	do	n't	have	 an 	 other 	 	thing	they	can	do	.
 The 	 y 	 	ca	n't	go	and	work	in	the	local	hotel	business	 be 	 cause 	 	there	is	n't	one	in	 the 	 ir 	 	community	.
If	you	go	to	the	Gulf	and	you	look	around	,	you	do	see	a	lot	of	oil	.
You	see	a	lot	of	oil	on	the	ocean	.
You	see	a	lot	of	oil	on	the	 shore 	 line 	 	.
If	you	go	to	the	 s 	 ite 	 	of	the	 blow 	 out 	 	,	it	 look 	 s 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	 un 	 believ 	 able 	 	.
It	 look 	 s 	 	like	you	just	 empti 	 ed 	 	the	oil	pan	in	your	car	,	and	you	just	 dump 	 ed 	 	it	in	the	ocean	.
And	one	of	the	 re 	 ally 	 	most	 in 	 credible 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	I	think	,	is	that	there	's	 no 	 body 	 	out	there	 try 	 ing 	 	to	collect	it	at	the	 s 	 ite 	 	where	it	is	 dense 	 st 	 	.
 Part 	 s 	 	of	the	ocean	there	look	just	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 apocalyp 	 tic 	 	.
You	go	in	 a 	 long 	 	the	shore	,	you	can	find	it	 every 	 where 	 	.
It	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 mess 	 y 	 	.
If	you	go	to	the	 place 	 s 	 	where	it	's	just	 arriv 	 ing 	 	,	like	the	eastern	part	of	the	Gulf	,	in	 Al 	 ab 	 ama 	 	,	there	's	still	people	using	the	beach	while	there	are	people	 clean 	 ing 	 	up	the	beach	.
And	they	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	strange	way	of	 clean 	 ing 	 	up	the	beach	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	not	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	put	more	than	10	 pound 	 s 	 	of	sand	in	a	50-gallon	plastic	bag	.
 The 	 y 	 	have	 thousand 	 s 	 	and	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	plastic	 bag 	 s 	 	.
I	do	n't	know	what	they	're	going	to	do	with	all	that	stuff	.
 Mean 	 while 	 	,	there	are	still	people	 try 	 ing 	 	to	use	the	beach	.
 The 	 y 	 	do	n't	see	the	little	,	 tin 	 y 	 	sign	that	 say 	 s 	 	:	``	Stay	out	of	the	water	.	''
 T 	 heir 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	are	in	the	water	;	they	're	 get 	 ting 	 	tar	all	over	 the 	 ir 	 	 clothe 	 s 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 sand 	 al 	 s 	 	.	It	's	a	mess	.
If	you	go	to	the	place	where	the	oil	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	while	,	it	's	an	even	 big 	 ger 	 	mess	.
And	there	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	 no 	 body 	 	there	 any 	 more 	 	,	a	few	people	 try 	 ing 	 	to	keep	using	it	.
You	see	people	who	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 shell 	 - 	 shock 	 ed 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 hard 	 work 	 ing 	 	people	.
All	they	know	about	life	is	they	get	up	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	and	if	 the 	 ir 	 	engine	 start 	 s 	 	,	they	go	to	work	.
 The 	 y 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	felt	that	they	could	 re 	 ly 	 	on	the	 assurance 	 s 	 	that	nature	 br 	 ought 	 	them	through	the	 eco 	 system 	 	of	the	Gulf	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	 find 	 ing 	 	that	 the 	 ir 	 	world	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 col 	 lap 	 s 	 ing 	 	.
And	so	you	can	see	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	 sign 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	shock	,	 sign 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 out 	 rage 	 	,	 sign 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	anger	,	and	 sign 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	grief	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	can	see	.
There	's	a	lot	you	ca	n't	see	,	 al 	 so 	 	,	 under 	 water 	 	.
What	's	going	on	 under 	 water 	 	?
Well	,	some	people	say	there	are	oil	 plume 	 s 	 	.
Some	people	say	there	are	not	oil	 plume 	 s 	 	.
And	 Congress 	 man 	 	 Mar 	 key 	 	 ask 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	``	 I 	 s 	 	it	going	to	take	a	 sub 	 marine 	 	ride	to	see	if	there	are	 re 	 ally 	 	oil	 plume 	 s 	 	?	''
But	I	could	n't	take	a	 sub 	 marine 	 	ride	--	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	between	the	time	I	 k 	 new 	 	I	was	coming	here	and	 to 	 day 	 	--	so	I	had	to	do	a	little	experiment	 my 	 self 	 	to	see	if	there	was	oil	in	the	Gulf	of	Mexico	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	Gulf	of	Mexico	,	 spark 	 ling 	 	place	full	of	fish	.
I	 create 	 d 	 	a	little	oil	 s 	 pill 	 	in	the	Gulf	of	Mexico	.
And	I	 learn 	 ed 	 	--	in	fact	,	I	 confirm 	 ed 	 	--	the	 hypo 	 thesis 	 	that	oil	and	water	do	n't	mix	 un 	 til 	 	you	add	a	 dispers 	 ant 	 	,	and	then	they	start	 mix 	 ing 	 	.
And	you	add	a	little	energy	from	the	wind	and	the	 wave 	 s 	 	,	and	you	get	a	big	mess	,	a	big	mess	that	you	ca	n't	possibly	clean	,	you	ca	n't	touch	,	you	ca	n't	 ex 	 tract 	 	and	,	I	think	most	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	I	think	--	you	ca	n't	see	it	.
I	think	it	's	 be 	 ing 	 	 hid 	 den 	 	on	purpose	.
 N 	 ow 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 catastroph 	 e 	 	and	 s 	 uch 	 	a	mess	,	that	 lot 	 s 	 	of	stuff	is	 leak 	 ing 	 	out	on	the	 edge 	 s 	 	of	the	information	stream	.
But	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	people	have	 s 	 aid 	 	,	there	's	a	large	attempt	to	suppress	what	's	going	on	.
 Personal 	 ly 	 	,	I	think	that	the	 dispers 	 ants 	 	are	a	major	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	to	hide	the	body	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	put	the	 murder 	 er 	 	in	charge	of	the	crime	scene	.
But	you	can	see	it	.
You	can	see	where	the	oil	is	 concent 	 rated 	 	at	the	surface	,	and	then	it	is	 attack 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	do	n't	want	the	evidence	,	in	my	opinion	.
 Oka 	 y 	 	.
We	heard	that	bacteria	eat	oil	?
So	do	sea	 turtle 	 s 	 	.
When	it	 break 	 s 	 	up	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	long	way	to	go	before	it	 get 	 s 	 	down	to	bacteria	.
 Turtle 	 s 	 	eat	it	.	It	 get 	 s 	 	in	the	 gill 	 s 	 	of	fish	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	 guy 	 s 	 	have	to	swim	around	through	it	.
I	heard	the	most	 in 	 credible 	 	story	 to 	 day 	 	when	I	was	on	the	train	coming	here	.
A	writer	named	 T 	 ed 	 	 William 	 s 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	me	,	and	he	was	 ask 	 ing 	 	me	a	couple	of	 question 	 s 	 	about	what	I	saw	,	 be 	 cause 	 	he	's	writing	an	article	for	 Au 	 dub 	 on 	 	magazine	.
He	 s 	 aid 	 	that	he	had	 be 	 en 	 	in	the	Gulf	a	little	while	ago	--	like	about	a	week	ago	--	and	a	guy	who	had	 be 	 en 	 	a	 re 	 creation 	 al 	 	 fish 	 ing 	 	guide	took	him	out	to	show	him	what	's	going	on	.
That	guide	's	entire	calendar	year	is	 cancel 	 ed 	 	 book 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
He	 ha 	 s 	 	no	 book 	 ing 	 s 	 	left	.
 Every 	 body 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	deposit	back	.	 Every 	 body 	 	is	 flee 	 ing 	 	.
That	's	the	story	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	.
But	he	told	 T 	 ed 	 	that	on	the	last	day	he	went	out	,	a	 bottle 	 nose 	 	dolphin	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 appear 	 ed 	 	next	to	the	boat	,	and	it	was	 s 	 plat 	 tering 	 	oil	out	 it 	 s 	 	 blow 	 hole 	 	.
And	he	 move 	 d 	 	away	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	his	last	 fish 	 ing 	 	trip	,	and	he	 k 	 new 	 	that	the	 dolphin 	 s 	 	 s 	 care 	 	fish	.
So	he	 move 	 d 	 	away	from	it	,	 turn 	 ed 	 	around	a	few	 minute 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	it	was	right	next	to	the	side	of	the	boat	 aga 	 in 	 	.
He	 s 	 aid 	 	that	in	30	 year 	 s 	 	of	 fish 	 ing 	 	he	had	never	 s 	 een 	 	a	dolphin	do	that	.
And	he	felt	that	--	he	felt	that	it	was	coming	to	ask	for	help	.	 So 	 rry 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	in	the	 Ex 	 x 	 on 	 	Valdez	 s 	 pill 	 	,	about	30	percent	of	the	killer	 whale 	 s 	 	 di 	 ed 	 	in	the	first	few	 month 	 s 	 	.
 T 	 heir 	 	 number 	 s 	 	have	never	 re 	 cover 	 ed 	 	.
So	the	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	rate	of	all	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	is	going	to	be	 vari 	 able 	 	.
It	's	going	to	take	 long 	 er 	 	for	some	 thing 	 s 	 	.
And	some	 thing 	 s 	 	,	I	think	,	will	 prob 	 ably 	 	come	back	a	little	 fast 	 er 	 	.
The	other	thing	about	the	Gulf	that	is	 import 	 ant 	 	is	that	there	are	a	lot	of	 animal 	 s 	 	that	 concent 	 rate 	 	in	the	Gulf	at	certain	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	year	.
So	the	Gulf	is	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	piece	of	water	--	more	 import 	 ant 	 	than	a	similar	volume	of	water	in	the	open	Atlantic	Ocean	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	tuna	swim	the	entire	ocean	.
 The 	 y 	 	get	in	the	Gulf	 St 	 re 	 am 	 	.	 The 	 y 	 	go	all	the	way	to	 Euro 	 pe 	 	.
When	it	 come 	 s 	 	time	to	spawn	,	they	come	 in 	 side 	 	,	and	these	two	tuna	that	 we 	 re 	 	 tag 	 ged 	 	,	you	can	see	them	on	the	 spawn 	 ing 	 	 ground 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	right	in	the	area	of	the	 s 	 lick 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	 prob 	 ably 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	,	at	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 l 	 east 	 	,	a	 catastroph 	 ic 	 	 spawn 	 ing 	 	season	 th 	 is 	 	year	.
I	'm	 hop 	 ing 	 	that	 may 	 be 	 	the	 adult 	 s 	 	are	 avoid 	 ing 	 	that	 dirt 	 y 	 	water	.
 The 	 y 	 	do	n't	 usual 	 ly 	 	like	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	water	that	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 cloud 	 y 	 	 any 	 way 	 	.
But	these	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 high 	 - 	 performance 	 	athletic	 animal 	 s 	 	.
I	do	n't	know	what	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	stuff	will	do	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 gill 	 s 	 	.
I	do	n't	know	if	it	'll	affect	the	 adult 	 s 	 	.
If	it	's	not	,	it	's	 certain 	 ly 	 	 affect 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 egg 	 s 	 	and	 larva 	 e 	 	,	I	would	 certain 	 ly 	 	think	.
But	if	you	look	at	that	graph	that	 go 	 es 	 	down	and	down	and	down	,	that	's	what	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	species	through	 over 	 fish 	 ing 	 	over	 man 	 y 	 	 decade 	 s 	 	.
So	while	the	oil	 s 	 pill 	 	,	the	leak	,	the	 erupt 	 ion 	 	,	is	a	 catastroph 	 e 	 	,	I	think	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	keep	in	mind	that	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	a	lot	to	affect	what	's	in	the	ocean	for	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	long	time	.
It	's	not	like	we	're	 start 	 ing 	 	with	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
We	're	 start 	 ing 	 	with	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	had	a	lot	of	 stress 	 es 	 	and	a	lot	of	 problem 	 s 	 	to	begin	with	.
If	you	look	around	at	the	 bird 	 s 	 	,	there	are	a	lot	of	 bird 	 s 	 	in	the	Gulf	that	 concent 	 rate 	 	in	the	Gulf	at	certain	 time 	 s 	 	of	the	year	,	but	then	 leav 	 e 	 	.
And	they	populate	much	 large 	 r 	 	 area 	 s 	 	.
So	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	most	of	the	 bird 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	picture	are	 migr 	 atory 	 	 bird 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	 we 	 re 	 	all	on	the	Gulf	in	May	,	while	oil	was	 start 	 ing 	 	to	come	 a 	 shore 	 	in	certain	 place 	 s 	 	.
Down	on	the	lower	left	there	are	 Rud 	 dy 	 	 Turn 	 stone 	 s 	 	and	 Sand 	 er 	 ling 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	breed	in	the	high	 arc 	 tic 	 	,	and	they	winter	down	in	southern	South	America	.
But	they	 concent 	 rate 	 	in	the	Gulf	and	then	fan	out	all	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 arc 	 tic 	 	.
I	saw	 bird 	 s 	 	that	breed	in	 Green 	 land 	 	in	the	Gulf	,	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 hemi 	 spheric 	 	issue	.
The	economic	 effect 	 s 	 	go	at	 l 	 east 	 	 national 	 ly 	 	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	.
The	 bio 	 logical 	 	 effect 	 s 	 	are	 certain 	 ly 	 	 hemi 	 spheric 	 	.
I	think	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	most	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 mind 	 - 	 boggl 	 ing 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	total	 un 	 prepared 	 ness 	 	that	I	can	even	think	of	.
Even	when	the	 Japan 	 ese 	 	 bomb 	 ed 	 	Pearl	 Har 	 bor 	 	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	they	shot	back	.
And	we	just	seem	to	be	 un 	 able 	 	to	figure	out	what	to	do	.
There	was	 noth 	 ing 	 	ready	,	and	,	you	know	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	can	see	by	what	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	.
 Main 	 ly 	 	what	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	is	 boom 	 s 	 	and	 dispers 	 ants 	 	.
The	 boom 	 s 	 	are	 absolute 	 ly 	 	not	made	for	open	water	.
 The 	 y 	 	do	n't	even	attempt	to	corral	the	oil	where	it	is	most	 concent 	 rated 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	get	near	shore	.	Look	at	these	two	 boat 	 s 	 	.
That	one	on	the	right	is	 call 	 ed 	 	 Fish 	 ing 	 	 Fo 	 ol 	 	.
And	I	think	,	you	know	,	that	's	a	great	name	for	 boat 	 s 	 	that	think	that	they	're	going	to	do	 any 	 thing 	 	to	make	a	dent	in	 th 	 is 	 	by	 drag 	 ging 	 	a	boom	between	them	when	there	are	 liter 	 ally 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	square	 mile 	 s 	 	in	the	Gulf	right	now	with	oil	at	the	surface	.
The	 dispers 	 ants 	 	make	the	oil	go	right	under	the	 boom 	 s 	 	.
The	 boom 	 s 	 	are	 on 	 ly 	 	about	13	 inch 	 es 	 	in	 dia 	 meter 	 	.
So	it	's	just	 absolute 	 ly 	 	crazy	.
 He 	 re 	 	are	shrimp	 boat 	 s 	 	 employ 	 ed 	 	.
There	are	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	shrimp	 boat 	 s 	 	 employ 	 ed 	 	to	drag	 boom 	 s 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 net 	 s 	 	.
 He 	 re 	 	they	are	 work 	 ing 	 	.
You	can	see	 eas 	 ily 	 	that	all	the	 oil 	 y 	 	water	just	 go 	 es 	 	over	the	back	of	the	boom	.
All	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	is	 stir 	 ring 	 	it	.
It	's	just	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	.
 Al 	 so 	 	,	for	all	the	 shore 	 line 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 boom 	 s 	 	--	 hundred 	 s 	 	and	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 mile 	 s 	 	of	 shore 	 line 	 	--	all	of	the	 shore 	 line 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 boom 	 s 	 	,	there	's	 ad 	 ja 	 cent 	 	 shore 	 line 	 	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	any	 boom 	 s 	 	.
There	is	ample	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	for	oil	and	 dirt 	 y 	 	water	to	get	in	 be 	 hind 	 	them	.
And	that	lower	photo	,	that	's	a	bird	 colon 	 y 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 boom 	 ed 	 	.
 Every 	 body 	 	's	 try 	 ing 	 	to	protect	the	bird	 colon 	 ies 	 	there	.
Well	,	 a 	 s 	 	an	 ornitho 	 logist 	 	,	I	can	tell	you	that	 bird 	 s 	 	fly	,	and	that	--	and	that	 boom 	 ing 	 	a	bird	 colon 	 y 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	do	it	;	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	do	it	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	 bird 	 s 	 	make	a	living	by	 div 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	water	.
In	fact	,	 re 	 ally 	 	what	I	think	they	should	do	,	if	 any 	 thing 	 	--	they	're	 try 	 ing 	 	so	hard	to	protect	 t 	 hose 	 	 nest 	 s 	 	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	if	they	 destroy 	 ed 	 	every	single	nest	some	of	the	 bird 	 s 	 	would	 leav 	 e 	 	,	and	that	would	be	better	for	them	 th 	 is 	 	year	.
 A 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	 clean 	 ing 	 	them	,	I	do	n't	mean	to	cast	any	 aspers 	 ion 	 	on	people	 clean 	 ing 	 	 bird 	 s 	 	.
It	's	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	that	we	express	our	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
I	think	that	's	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	that	people	have	,	is	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
It	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	get	 t 	 hose 	 	 image 	 s 	 	and	to	show	it	.
But	 re 	 ally 	 	,	where	are	 t 	 hose 	 	 bird 	 s 	 	going	to	get	released	to	?
It	's	like	taking	 some 	 body 	 	out	of	a	 burn 	 ing 	 	building	,	 treat 	 ing 	 	them	for	smoke	 inhal 	 ation 	 	and	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	them	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	building	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	oil	is	still	 gush 	 ing 	 	.
I	 re 	 fuse 	 	to	 acknowledg 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	like	an	accident	.
I	think	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	result	of	gross	 neglig 	 ence 	 	.
Not	just	 B. 	 P 	 	.
 B. 	 P 	 	.	 oper 	 ated 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 slop 	 pi 	 ly 	 	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 reckless 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	could	.
And	they	 we 	 re 	 	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	do	so	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	absolute	failure	of	 over 	 sight 	 	of	the	government	that	's	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	our	government	,	 protect 	 ing 	 	us	.
It	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	--	you	see	 th 	 is 	 	sign	on	 al 	 most 	 	every	commercial	vessel	in	the	 Unit 	 ed 	 	 Stat 	 es 	 	--	you	know	,	if	you	 s 	 pill 	 ed 	 	a	couple	of	 gallon 	 s 	 	of	oil	,	you	would	be	in	big	trouble	.
And	you	have	to	 re 	 ally 	 	wonder	who	are	the	 law 	 s 	 	made	for	,	and	who	 ha 	 s 	 	gotten	above	the	 law 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	there	are	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	can	do	in	the	future	.
We	could	have	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	that	we	would	 re 	 ally 	 	need	.
It	would	not	take	an	awful	lot	to	 anticip 	 ate 	 	that	after	making	30,000	 hole 	 s 	 	in	the	sea	floor	of	the	Gulf	of	Mexico	looking	for	oil	,	oil	might	start	coming	out	of	one	of	them	.
And	you	'd	have	some	idea	of	what	to	do	.
That	's	 certain 	 ly 	 	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	need	to	do	.
But	I	think	we	have	to	understand	where	 th 	 is 	 	leak	 re 	 ally 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	from	.
It	 re 	 ally 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	from	the	 destruct 	 ion 	 	of	the	idea	that	the	government	is	there	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	our	government	,	 me 	 ant 	 	to	protect	the	 large 	 r 	 	public	interest	.
So	I	think	that	the	oil	 blow 	 out 	 	,	the	bank	 bail 	 out 	 	,	the	mortgage	crisis	and	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 symptom 	 s 	 	of	the	same	cause	.
We	still	seem	to	understand	that	at	 l 	 east 	 	we	need	the	police	to	protect	us	from	a	few	bad	people	.
And	even	 th 	 ough 	 	the	police	can	be	a	little	 annoy 	 ing 	 	at	 time 	 s 	 	--	giving	us	 ticket 	 s 	 	and	stuff	like	that	--	 no 	 body 	 	 say 	 s 	 	that	we	should	just	get	rid	of	them	.
But	in	the	entire	rest	of	government	right	now	and	for	the	last	at	 l 	 east 	 	30	 year 	 s 	 	,	there	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	culture	of	 de 	 regulat 	 ion 	 	that	is	 caus 	 ed 	 	 direct 	 ly 	 	by	the	people	who	we	need	to	be	 protect 	 ed 	 	from	,	 buy 	 ing 	 	the	government	out	from	under	us	.
 N 	 ow 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	problem	for	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	long	time	.
You	can	see	that	 corporation 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 il 	 legal 	 	at	the	 found 	 ing 	 	of	America	,	and	even	 Thom 	 a 	 s 	 	Jefferson	 complain 	 ed 	 	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	 bid 	 d 	 ing 	 	 defi 	 ance 	 	to	the	 law 	 s 	 	of	our	country	.
 Oka 	 y 	 	,	people	who	say	they	're	 conserv 	 ative 	 	,	if	they	 re 	 ally 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	 re 	 ally 	 	 conserv 	 ative 	 	and	 re 	 ally 	 	 patriot 	 ic 	 	,	they	would	tell	these	 corporation 	 s 	 	to	go	to	hell	.
That	's	what	it	would	 re 	 ally 	 	mean	to	be	 conserv 	 ative 	 	.
So	what	we	 re 	 ally 	 	need	to	do	is	regain	the	idea	that	it	's	our	government	 safe 	 guard 	 ing 	 	our	 interest 	 s 	 	and	regain	a	sense	of	 un 	 ity 	 	and	common	cause	in	our	country	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	lost	.
I	think	there	are	 sign 	 s 	 	of	hope	.
We	seem	to	be	 wa 	 king 	 	up	a	little	bit	.
The	 Glass 	 - 	 Stea 	 gall 	 	Act	--	which	was	 re 	 ally 	 	to	protect	us	from	the	kind	of	thing	that	 caus 	 ed 	 	the	 recess 	 ion 	 	to	happen	,	and	the	bank	 melt 	 down 	 	and	all	that	stuff	that	 requir 	 ed 	 	the	 bail 	 out 	 s 	 	--	that	was	put	in	effect	in	1933	,	was	 system 	 at 	 ically 	 	 destroy 	 ed 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	there	's	a	mood	to	put	some	of	that	stuff	back	in	place	,	but	the	 lobby 	 ists 	 	are	 al 	 ready 	 	there	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 weak 	 en 	 	the	 regulat 	 ions 	 	after	the	 legisl 	 ation 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	just	 pass 	 ed 	 	.
So	it	's	a	 continu 	 ed 	 	fight	.
It	's	a	historic	moment	right	now	.
We	're	either	going	to	have	an	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 un 	 mitig 	 ated 	 	 catastroph 	 e 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	oil	leak	in	the	Gulf	,	or	we	will	make	the	moment	we	need	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	people	have	 not 	 ed 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
There	's	 certain 	 ly 	 	a	common	theme	about	 need 	 ing 	 	to	make	the	moment	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
We	've	 be 	 en 	 	through	 th 	 is 	 	before	with	other	ways	of	 off 	 shore 	 	 drill 	 ing 	 	.
The	first	 off 	 shore 	 	 well 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 whale 	 s 	 	.
The	first	 off 	 shore 	 	 drill 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 har 	 poons 	 	.
We	 empti 	 ed 	 	the	ocean	of	the	 whale 	 s 	 	at	that	time	.
 N 	 ow 	 	are	we	 s 	 tuck 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	?
Ever	since	we	lived	in	 cave 	 s 	 	,	every	time	we	 want 	 ed 	 	any	energy	,	we	lit	 some 	 thing 	 	on	fire	,	and	that	is	still	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	.
We	're	still	 light 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	on	fire	every	time	we	want	energy	.
And	people	say	we	ca	n't	have	clean	energy	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	too	expensive	.
Who	 say 	 s 	 	it	's	too	expensive	?
People	who	sell	us	fossil	 fuel 	 s 	 	.
We	've	 be 	 en 	 	here	before	with	energy	,	and	people	 say 	 ing 	 	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	can	not	 with 	 stand 	 	a	 s 	 witch 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 cheap 	 est 	 	energy	was	 slave 	 ry 	 	.
 En 	 er 	 gy 	 	is	 al 	 ways 	 	a	moral	issue	.
It	's	an	issue	that	is	moral	right	now	.
It	's	a	matter	of	right	and	wrong	.
Thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
Mark	 Zucker 	 berg 	 	,	a	journalist	was	 ask 	 ing 	 	him	a	question	about	the	news	feed	.
And	the	journalist	was	 ask 	 ing 	 	him	,	``	Why	is	 th 	 is 	 	so	 import 	 ant 	 	?	''
And	 Zucker 	 berg 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	A	squirrel	 dy 	 ing 	 	in	your	front	yard	may	be	more	relevant	to	your	 interest 	 s 	 	right	now	than	people	 dy 	 ing 	 	in	 Afri 	 ca 	 	.	''
And	I	want	to	talk	about	what	a	Web	based	on	that	idea	of	relevance	might	look	like	.
So	when	I	was	growing	up	in	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 r 	 ural 	 	area	in	 Main 	 e 	 	,	the	Internet	 me 	 ant 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	different	to	me	.
It	 me 	 ant 	 	a	 connect 	 ion 	 	to	the	world	.
It	 me 	 ant 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	would	connect	us	all	together	.
And	I	was	 s 	 ure 	 	that	it	was	going	to	be	great	for	 demo 	 cracy 	 	and	for	our	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
But	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	shift	in	how	information	is	 flow 	 ing 	 	 on 	 line 	 	,	and	it	's	 in 	 visible 	 	.
And	if	we	do	n't	pay	attention	to	it	,	it	could	be	a	real	problem	.
So	I	first	 notice 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	in	a	place	I	 s 	 pend 	 	a	lot	of	time	--	my	Facebook	page	.
I	'm	 progress 	 ive 	 	,	 politic 	 ally 	 	--	big	surprise	--	but	I	've	 al 	 ways 	 	gone	out	of	my	way	to	meet	 conserv 	 ative 	 s 	 	.
I	like	 hear 	 ing 	 	what	they	're	 think 	 ing 	 	about	;	I	like	 see 	 ing 	 	what	they	link	to	;	I	like	 learn 	 ing 	 	a	thing	or	two	.
And	so	I	was	 surprise 	 d 	 	when	I	 notice 	 d 	 	one	day	that	the	 conserv 	 ative 	 s 	 	had	 disappear 	 ed 	 	from	my	Facebook	feed	.
And	what	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	was	going	on	was	that	Facebook	was	looking	at	which	 link 	 s 	 	I	 click 	 ed 	 	on	,	and	it	was	 not 	 ic 	 ing 	 	that	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	I	was	 click 	 ing 	 	more	on	my	liberal	 friend 	 s 	 	'	 link 	 s 	 	than	on	my	 conserv 	 ative 	 	 friend 	 s 	 	'	 link 	 s 	 	.
And	 with 	 out 	 	 consult 	 ing 	 	me	about	it	,	it	had	 edit 	 ed 	 	them	out	.
 The 	 y 	 	 disappear 	 ed 	 	.
So	Facebook	is	n't	the	 on 	 ly 	 	place	that	's	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 in 	 visible 	 	,	 algorithm 	 ic 	 	 edit 	 ing 	 	of	the	Web	.
Google	's	 do 	 ing 	 	it	too	.
If	I	search	for	 some 	 thing 	 	,	and	you	search	for	 some 	 thing 	 	,	even	right	now	at	the	 ver 	 y 	 	same	time	,	we	may	get	 ver 	 y 	 	different	search	 result 	 s 	 	.
Even	if	you	're	 log 	 ged 	 	out	,	one	engineer	told	me	,	there	are	57	 signal 	 s 	 	that	Google	 look 	 s 	 	at	--	 every 	 thing 	 	from	what	kind	of	computer	you	're	on	to	what	kind	of	 brow 	 s 	 er 	 	you	're	using	to	where	you	're	 locate 	 d 	 	--	that	it	uses	to	 personal 	 ly 	 	tailor	your	 que 	 ry 	 	 result 	 s 	 	.
Think	about	it	for	a	second	:	there	is	no	standard	Google	 any 	 more 	 	.
And	you	know	,	the	funny	thing	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	it	's	hard	to	see	.
You	ca	n't	see	how	different	your	search	 result 	 s 	 	are	from	 any 	 one 	 	else	's	.
But	a	couple	of	 week 	 s 	 	ago	,	I	 ask 	 ed 	 	a	bunch	of	 friend 	 s 	 	to	Google	``	Egypt	''	and	to	 s 	 end 	 	me	screen	 shot 	 s 	 	of	what	they	got	.
So	here	's	my	friend	Scott	's	screen	shot	.
And	here	's	my	friend	Daniel	's	screen	shot	.
When	you	put	them	 side 	 - 	 by 	 - 	 side 	 	,	you	do	n't	even	have	to	read	the	 link 	 s 	 	to	see	how	different	these	two	 page 	 s 	 	are	.
But	when	you	do	read	the	 link 	 s 	 	,	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 remark 	 able 	 	.
Daniel	did	n't	get	 any 	 thing 	 	about	the	 protest 	 s 	 	in	Egypt	at	all	in	his	first	page	of	Google	 result 	 s 	 	.
Scott	's	 result 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	full	of	them	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	big	story	of	the	day	at	that	time	.
That	's	how	different	these	 result 	 s 	 	are	 be 	 coming 	 	.
So	it	's	not	just	Google	and	Facebook	either	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	 s 	 weep 	 ing 	 	the	Web	.
There	are	a	whole	host	of	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	that	are	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 personal 	 ization 	 	.
 Ya 	 hoo 	 	 New 	 s 	 	,	the	 big 	 gest 	 	news	 s 	 ite 	 	on	the	Internet	,	is	now	 personal 	 ized 	 	--	different	people	get	different	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 Hu 	 ff 	 ington 	 	Post	,	the	 Wash 	 ington 	 	Post	,	the	New	York	 Time 	 s 	 	--	all	 flirt 	 ing 	 	with	 personal 	 ization 	 	in	 vari 	 ous 	 	ways	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	 move 	 s 	 	us	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	 to 	 ward 	 	a	world	in	which	the	Internet	is	 show 	 ing 	 	us	what	it	 think 	 s 	 	we	want	to	see	,	but	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	what	we	need	to	see	.
 A 	 s 	 	 Er 	 ic 	 	 Sch 	 mid 	 t 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	It	will	be	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	for	people	to	watch	or	 consum 	 e 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	not	in	some	sense	 be 	 en 	 	 tailor 	 ed 	 	for	them	.	''
So	I	do	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	problem	.
And	I	think	,	if	you	take	all	of	these	 filter 	 s 	 	together	,	you	take	all	these	 algorithm 	 s 	 	,	you	get	what	I	call	a	filter	bubble	.
And	your	filter	bubble	is	your	own	personal	,	 un 	 ique 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 	of	information	that	you	live	in	 on 	 line 	 	.
And	what	's	in	your	filter	bubble	 depend 	 s 	 	on	who	you	are	,	and	it	 depend 	 s 	 	on	what	you	do	.
But	the	thing	is	that	you	do	n't	decide	what	 get 	 s 	 	in	.
And	more	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	you	do	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	see	what	 get 	 s 	 	 edit 	 ed 	 	out	.
So	one	of	the	 problem 	 s 	 	with	the	filter	bubble	was	 discover 	 ed 	 	by	some	 research 	 ers 	 	at	Netflix	.
And	they	 we 	 re 	 	looking	at	the	Netflix	 queue 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 notice 	 d 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	kind	of	funny	that	a	lot	of	us	 prob 	 ably 	 	have	 notice 	 d 	 	,	which	is	there	are	some	 movie 	 s 	 	that	just	sort	of	zip	right	up	and	out	to	our	 house 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	enter	the	queue	,	they	just	zip	right	out	.
So	``	 Ir 	 on 	 	Man	''	 zip 	 s 	 	right	out	,	and	``	 Wait 	 ing 	 	for	 Super 	 man 	 	''	can	wait	for	a	 re 	 ally 	 	long	time	.
What	they	 discover 	 ed 	 	was	that	in	our	Netflix	 queue 	 s 	 	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	epic	struggle	going	on	between	our	future	 aspir 	 ation 	 al 	 	 s 	 elves 	 	and	our	more	 im 	 puls 	 ive 	 	present	 s 	 elves 	 	.
You	know	we	all	want	to	be	 some 	 one 	 	who	 ha 	 s 	 	 watch 	 ed 	 	``	 Ra 	 s 	 hom 	 on 	 	,	''	but	right	now	we	want	to	watch	``	 A 	 ce 	 	 Ven 	 tur 	 a 	 	''	for	the	fourth	time	.
So	the	best	 edit 	 ing 	 	 give 	 s 	 	us	a	bit	of	both	.
It	 give 	 s 	 	us	a	little	bit	of	 Just 	 in 	 	 Bi 	 e 	 ber 	 	and	a	little	bit	of	 Afghan 	 istan 	 	.
It	 give 	 s 	 	us	some	information	 veget 	 able 	 s 	 	;	it	 give 	 s 	 	us	some	information	dessert	.
And	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	with	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 algorithm 	 ic 	 	 filter 	 s 	 	,	these	 personal 	 ized 	 	 filter 	 s 	 	,	is	that	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	 main 	 ly 	 	looking	at	what	you	click	on	first	,	it	can	throw	off	that	balance	.
And	 in 	 stead 	 	of	a	 balanc 	 ed 	 	information	diet	,	you	can	end	up	 surround 	 ed 	 	by	information	junk	food	.
What	 th 	 is 	 	 suggest 	 s 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	that	we	may	have	the	story	about	the	Internet	wrong	.
In	a	 broad 	 cast 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	the	 found 	 ing 	 	 mytho 	 logy 	 	 go 	 es 	 	--	in	a	 broad 	 cast 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	these	 gate 	 keeper 	 s 	 	,	the	 editor 	 s 	 	,	and	they	controlled	the	 flow 	 s 	 	of	information	.
And	 a 	 long 	 	came	the	Internet	and	it	 s 	 wept 	 	them	out	of	the	way	,	and	it	 allow 	 ed 	 	all	of	us	to	connect	together	,	and	it	was	awesome	.
But	that	's	not	 actual 	 ly 	 	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	right	now	.
What	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	is	more	of	a	 pass 	 ing 	 	of	the	torch	from	human	 gate 	 keeper 	 s 	 	to	 algorithm 	 ic 	 	 one 	 s 	 	.
And	the	thing	is	that	the	 algorithm 	 s 	 	do	n't	yet	have	the	kind	of	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	 ethic 	 s 	 	that	the	 editor 	 s 	 	did	.
So	if	 algorithm 	 s 	 	are	going	to	 cur 	 ate 	 	the	world	for	us	,	if	they	're	going	to	decide	what	we	get	to	see	and	what	we	do	n't	get	to	see	,	then	we	need	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	they	're	not	just	 key 	 ed 	 	to	relevance	.
We	need	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	they	 al 	 so 	 	show	us	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 un 	 comfort 	 able 	 	or	 challeng 	 ing 	 	or	 import 	 ant 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	TED	 do 	 es 	 	--	other	 point 	 s 	 	of	view	.
And	the	thing	is	,	we	've	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	here	before	 a 	 s 	 	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
In	1915	,	it	's	not	like	 news 	 paper 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 sweat 	 ing 	 	a	lot	about	 the 	 ir 	 	civic	 respons 	 ibilities 	 	.
 Th 	 en 	 	people	 notice 	 d 	 	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
That	,	in	fact	,	you	could	n't	have	a	 function 	 ing 	 	 demo 	 cracy 	 	if	 citizen 	 s 	 	did	n't	get	a	good	flow	of	information	,	that	the	 news 	 paper 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	critical	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 act 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	filter	,	and	then	 journalist 	 ic 	 	 ethic 	 s 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	.
It	was	n't	perfect	,	but	it	got	us	through	the	last	century	.
And	so	now	,	we	're	kind	of	back	in	1915	on	the	Web	.
And	we	need	the	new	 gate 	 keeper 	 s 	 	to	encode	that	kind	of	 respons 	 ibility 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	code	that	they	're	writing	.
I	know	that	there	are	a	lot	of	people	here	from	Facebook	and	from	Google	--	 La 	 rry 	 	and	 Serge 	 y 	 	--	people	who	have	 help 	 ed 	 	build	the	Web	 a 	 s 	 	it	is	,	and	I	'm	 grat 	 e 	 ful 	 	for	that	.
But	we	 re 	 ally 	 	need	you	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	these	 algorithm 	 s 	 	have	 encode 	 d 	 	in	them	a	sense	of	the	public	life	,	a	sense	of	civic	 respons 	 ibility 	 	.
We	need	you	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	they	're	 trans 	 parent 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	that	we	can	see	what	the	 rule 	 s 	 	are	that	determine	what	 get 	 s 	 	through	our	 filter 	 s 	 	.
And	we	need	you	to	give	us	some	control	so	that	we	can	decide	what	 get 	 s 	 	through	and	what	 do 	 es 	 	n't	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	I	think	we	 re 	 ally 	 	need	the	Internet	to	be	that	thing	that	we	all	 dream 	 ed 	 	of	it	 be 	 ing 	 	.
We	need	it	to	connect	us	all	together	.
We	need	it	to	 introduc 	 e 	 	us	to	new	 idea 	 s 	 	and	new	people	and	different	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 s 	 	.
And	it	's	not	going	to	do	that	if	it	 leav 	 es 	 	us	all	 isolate 	 d 	 	in	a	Web	of	one	.
Thank	you	.
We	live	in	in	a	 remark 	 able 	 	time	,	the	age	of	 genomic 	 s 	 	.
Your	genome	is	the	entire	sequence	of	your	DNA	.
Your	sequence	and	mine	are	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	different	.
That	's	why	we	look	different	.
I	've	got	 brow 	 n 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	;	you	might	have	blue	or	gray	.
But	it	's	not	just	 skin 	 - 	 deep 	 	.
The	 head 	 lines 	 	tell	us	that	 gene 	 s 	 	can	give	us	 scar 	 y 	 	 disease 	 s 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	even	shape	our	 personal 	 ity 	 	,	or	give	us	mental	 dis 	 order 	 s 	 	.
Our	 gene 	 s 	 	seem	to	have	awesome	power	over	our	 de 	 s 	 tin 	 ies 	 	.
And	yet	,	I	would	like	to	think	that	I	am	more	than	my	 gene 	 s 	 	.
What	do	you	 guy 	 s 	 	think	?
 A 	 re 	 	you	more	than	your	 gene 	 s 	 	?
Yes	?
I	think	some	people	agree	with	me	.
I	think	we	should	make	a	 state 	 ment 	 	.
I	think	we	should	say	it	all	together	.
All	right	:	``	I	'm	more	than	my	 gene 	 s 	 	''	--	all	together	.
 Every 	 body 	 	:	I	am	more	than	my	 gene 	 s 	 	.
 Seb 	 ast 	 ian 	 	 Se 	 ung 	 	:	What	am	I	?
I	am	my	 connect 	 ome 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	since	you	 guy 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	great	,	 may 	 be 	 	you	can	humor	me	and	say	 th 	 is 	 	all	together	too	.
Right	.	All	together	now	.
 Every 	 body 	 	:	I	am	my	 connect 	 ome 	 	.
 S 	 S 	 	:	That	 sound 	 ed 	 	great	.
You	know	,	you	 guy 	 s 	 	are	so	great	,	you	do	n't	even	know	what	a	 connect 	 ome 	 	is	,	and	you	're	 will 	 ing 	 	to	play	 a 	 long 	 	with	me	.
I	could	just	go	home	now	.
Well	,	so	far	 on 	 ly 	 	one	 connect 	 ome 	 	is	known	,	that	of	 th 	 is 	 	 tin 	 y 	 	worm	.
 It 	 s 	 	modest	nervous	system	 consist 	 s 	 	of	just	300	 neuro 	 ns 	 	.
And	in	the	1970s	and	'80s	,	a	team	of	 scientist 	 s 	 	 ma 	 pped 	 	all	7,000	 connect 	 ions 	 	between	the	 neuro 	 ns 	 	.
In	 th 	 is 	 	 dia 	 gram 	 	,	every	 no 	 de 	 	is	a	 neuro 	 n 	 	,	and	every	line	is	a	 connect 	 ion 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	 connect 	 ome 	 	of	the	worm	C.	 ele 	 gan 	 s 	 	.
Your	 connect 	 ome 	 	is	far	more	complex	than	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	your	brain	 contain 	 s 	 	100	billion	 neuro 	 ns 	 	and	10,000	 time 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 connect 	 ions 	 	.
There	's	a	 dia 	 gram 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	for	your	brain	,	but	there	's	no	way	it	would	fit	on	 th 	 is 	 	slide	.
Your	 connect 	 ome 	 	 contain 	 s 	 	one	million	 time 	 s 	 	more	 connect 	 ions 	 	than	your	genome	 ha 	 s 	 	 letter 	 s 	 	.
That	's	a	lot	of	information	.
What	's	in	that	information	?
We	do	n't	know	for	 s 	 ure 	 	,	but	there	are	 the 	 ories 	 	.
Since	the	19th	century	,	 neuro 	 scientist 	 s 	 	have	 specul 	 ated 	 	that	 may 	 be 	 	your	 memor 	 ies 	 	--	the	information	that	 make 	 s 	 	you	,	you	--	 may 	 be 	 	your	 memor 	 ies 	 	are	 store 	 d 	 	in	the	 connect 	 ions 	 	between	your	brain	's	 neuro 	 ns 	 	.
And	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	other	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	of	your	personal	 ident 	 ity 	 	--	 may 	 be 	 	your	 personal 	 ity 	 	and	your	 in 	 tell 	 ect 	 	--	 may 	 be 	 	they	're	 al 	 so 	 	 encode 	 d 	 	in	the	 connect 	 ions 	 	between	your	 neuro 	 ns 	 	.
And	so	now	you	can	see	why	I	 pro 	 posed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 hypo 	 thesis 	 	:	I	am	my	 connect 	 ome 	 	.
I	did	n't	ask	you	to	chant	it	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	true	;	I	just	want	you	to	remember	it	.
And	in	fact	,	we	do	n't	know	if	 th 	 is 	 	 hypo 	 thesis 	 	is	correct	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	never	had	 techno 	 logies 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	to	test	it	.
 Find 	 ing 	 	that	worm	 connect 	 ome 	 	took	over	a	dozen	 year 	 s 	 	of	 ted 	 ious 	 	labor	.
And	to	find	the	 connect 	 ome 	 s 	 	of	 brain 	 s 	 	more	like	our	own	,	we	need	more	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	that	are	 autom 	 ated 	 	,	that	will	speed	up	the	process	of	 find 	 ing 	 	 connect 	 ome 	 s 	 	.
And	in	the	next	few	 minute 	 s 	 	,	I	'll	tell	you	about	some	of	these	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	which	are	 current 	 ly 	 	under	 develop 	 ment 	 	in	my	lab	and	the	 lab 	 s 	 	of	my	 collabor 	 ators 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	you	've	 prob 	 ably 	 	 s 	 een 	 	 picture 	 s 	 	of	 neuro 	 ns 	 	before	.
You	can	 recogn 	 ize 	 	them	 instant 	 ly 	 	by	 the 	 ir 	 	fantastic	 shape 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	extend	long	and	 delic 	 ate 	 	 branch 	 es 	 	,	and	in	short	,	they	look	like	 tree 	 s 	 	.
But	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	a	single	 neuro 	 n 	 	.
In	order	to	find	 connect 	 ome 	 s 	 	,	we	have	to	see	all	the	 neuro 	 ns 	 	at	the	same	time	.
So	let	's	meet	 Bob 	 by 	 	Kasthuri	,	who	 work 	 s 	 	in	the	 labor 	 atory 	 	of	Jeff	 Licht 	 man 	 	at	Harvard	 Univers 	 ity 	 	.
 Bob 	 by 	 	is	 hold 	 ing 	 	 fantastic 	 ally 	 	thin	 slice 	 s 	 	of	a	mouse	brain	.
And	we	're	 zoom 	 ing 	 	in	by	a	factor	of	100,000	 time 	 s 	 	to	obtain	the	 re 	 solution 	 	,	so	that	we	can	see	the	 branch 	 es 	 	of	 neuro 	 ns 	 	all	at	the	same	time	.
 Ex 	 cept 	 	,	you	still	may	not	 re 	 ally 	 	 recogn 	 ize 	 	them	,	and	that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	to	work	in	three	 dimension 	 s 	 	.
If	we	take	 man 	 y 	 	 image 	 s 	 	of	 man 	 y 	 	 slice 	 s 	 	of	the	brain	and	stack	them	up	,	we	get	a	 three 	 - 	 dimensional 	 	image	.
And	still	,	you	may	not	see	the	 branch 	 es 	 	.
So	we	start	at	the	top	,	and	we	color	in	the	 cross 	 - 	 section 	 	of	one	branch	in	red	,	and	we	do	that	for	the	next	slice	and	for	the	next	slice	.
And	we	keep	on	 do 	 ing 	 	that	,	slice	after	slice	.
If	we	 continu 	 e 	 	through	the	entire	stack	,	we	can	 re 	 construct 	 	the	 three 	 - 	 dimensional 	 	shape	of	a	small	fragment	of	a	branch	of	a	 neuro 	 n 	 	.
And	we	can	do	that	for	 an 	 other 	 	 neuro 	 n 	 	in	green	.
And	you	can	see	that	the	green	 neuro 	 n 	 	 touch 	 es 	 	the	red	 neuro 	 n 	 	at	two	 location 	 s 	 	,	and	these	are	what	are	 call 	 ed 	 	 synapse 	 s 	 	.
Let	's	zoom	in	on	one	synapse	,	and	keep	your	 eye 	 s 	 	on	the	 in 	 terior 	 	of	the	green	 neuro 	 n 	 	.
You	should	see	small	 circle 	 s 	 	--	these	are	 call 	 ed 	 	 ves 	 icles 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	contain	a	molecule	know	 a 	 s 	 	a	 neuro 	 transmit 	 ter 	 	.
And	so	when	the	green	 neuro 	 n 	 	 want 	 s 	 	to	communicate	,	it	 want 	 s 	 	to	 s 	 end 	 	a	 mess 	 age 	 	to	the	red	 neuro 	 n 	 	,	it	 s 	 pit 	 s 	 	out	 neuro 	 transmit 	 ter 	 	.
At	the	synapse	,	the	two	 neuro 	 ns 	 	are	 s 	 aid 	 	to	be	 connect 	 ed 	 	like	two	 friend 	 s 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	on	the	 tele 	 phone 	 	.
So	you	see	how	to	find	a	synapse	.
How	can	we	find	an	entire	 connect 	 ome 	 	?
Well	,	we	take	 th 	 is 	 	 three 	 - 	 dimensional 	 	stack	of	 image 	 s 	 	and	treat	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	 gig 	 antic 	 	 three 	 - 	 dimensional 	 	 color 	 ing 	 	book	.
We	color	every	 neuro 	 n 	 	in	,	in	a	different	color	,	and	then	we	look	through	all	of	the	 image 	 s 	 	,	find	the	 synapse 	 s 	 	and	note	the	 color 	 s 	 	of	the	two	 neuro 	 ns 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	in	each	synapse	.
If	we	can	do	that	 through 	 out 	 	all	the	 image 	 s 	 	,	we	could	find	a	 connect 	 ome 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	,	you	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	the	 bas 	 ic 	 s 	 	of	 neuro 	 ns 	 	and	 synapse 	 s 	 	.
And	so	I	think	we	're	ready	to	tackle	one	of	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 question 	 s 	 	in	 neuro 	 science 	 	:	how	are	the	 brain 	 s 	 	of	men	and	women	different	?
 Accord 	 ing 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	 self 	 - 	 help 	 	book	,	 guy 	 s 	 	 brain 	 s 	 	are	like	 wa 	 ff 	 les 	 	;	they	keep	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	 compartment 	 al 	 ized 	 	in	boxes	.
 Girl 	 s 	 	'	 brain 	 s 	 	are	like	spaghetti	;	 every 	 thing 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	life	is	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	 every 	 thing 	 	else	.
You	 guy 	 s 	 	are	 laugh 	 ing 	 	,	but	you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	book	 change 	 d 	 	my	life	.
But	 serious 	 ly 	 	,	what	's	wrong	with	 th 	 is 	 	?
You	 al 	 ready 	 	know	 en 	 ough 	 	to	tell	me	--	what	's	wrong	with	 th 	 is 	 	 state 	 ment 	 	?
It	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	 whet 	 her 	 	you	're	a	guy	or	girl	,	 every 	 one 	 	's	 brain 	 s 	 	are	like	spaghetti	.
Or	 may 	 be 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	fine	 cap 	 ell 	 ini 	 	with	 branch 	 es 	 	.
Just	 a 	 s 	 	one	strand	of	spaghetti	 contact 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	other	 strand 	 s 	 	on	your	plate	,	one	 neuro 	 n 	 	 touch 	 es 	 	 man 	 y 	 	other	 neuro 	 ns 	 	through	 the 	 ir 	 	 entangle 	 d 	 	 branch 	 es 	 	.
One	 neuro 	 n 	 	can	be	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	so	 man 	 y 	 	other	 neuro 	 ns 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	can	be	 synapse 	 s 	 	at	these	 point 	 s 	 	of	contact	.
By	now	,	you	might	have	sort	of	lost	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	on	how	large	 th 	 is 	 	cube	of	brain	tissue	 actual 	 ly 	 	is	.
And	so	let	's	do	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 compar 	 ison 	 s 	 	to	show	you	.
I	assure	you	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 tin 	 y 	 	.	It	's	just	six	 micro 	 ns 	 	on	a	side	.
So	,	here	's	how	it	 stack 	 s 	 	up	against	an	entire	 neuro 	 n 	 	.
And	you	can	tell	that	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 on 	 ly 	 	the	 small 	 est 	 	 fragment 	 s 	 	of	 branch 	 es 	 	are	 contain 	 ed 	 	 in 	 side 	 	 th 	 is 	 	cube	.
And	a	 neuro 	 n 	 	,	well	,	that	's	 small 	 er 	 	than	brain	.
And	that	's	just	a	mouse	brain	--	it	's	a	lot	 small 	 er 	 	than	a	human	brain	.
So	when	show	my	 friend 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	they	've	told	me	,	``	You	know	,	 Seb 	 ast 	 ian 	 	,	you	should	just	give	up	.
 Neuro 	 science 	 	is	 hope 	 less 	 	.	''
 Be 	 cause 	 	if	you	look	at	a	brain	with	your	naked	eye	,	you	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	see	how	complex	it	is	,	but	when	you	use	a	 micro 	 scope 	 	,	 final 	 ly 	 	the	 hid 	 den 	 	 complex 	 ity 	 	is	 reveal 	 ed 	 	.
In	the	17th	century	,	the	 mathematic 	 ian 	 	and	 philosoph 	 er 	 	,	 Bla 	 ise 	 	 Pa 	 scal 	 	,	wrote	of	his	dread	of	the	infinite	,	his	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	 in 	 sign 	 ific 	 ance 	 	at	 contempl 	 ating 	 	the	vast	 reach 	 es 	 	of	 out 	 er 	 	space	.
And	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	scientist	,	I	'm	not	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	talk	about	my	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	--	too	much	information	,	professor	.
But	may	I	?
I	feel	curiosity	,	and	I	feel	wonder	,	but	at	 time 	 s 	 	I	have	 al 	 so 	 	felt	despair	.
Why	did	I	 choos 	 e 	 	to	 stud 	 y 	 	 th 	 is 	 	organ	that	is	so	awesome	in	 it 	 s 	 	 complex 	 ity 	 	that	it	might	well	be	infinite	?
It	's	absurd	.
How	could	we	even	 da 	 re 	 	to	think	that	we	might	ever	understand	 th 	 is 	 	?
And	yet	,	I	persist	in	 th 	 is 	 	 qui 	 x 	 otic 	 	endeavor	.
And	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	these	 day 	 s 	 	I	harbor	new	 hope 	 s 	 	.
 Some 	 day 	 	,	a	fleet	of	 micro 	 scope 	 s 	 	will	capture	every	 neuro 	 n 	 	and	every	synapse	in	a	vast	 data 	 base 	 	of	 image 	 s 	 	.
And	some	day	,	 artificial 	 ly 	 	intelligent	 super 	 computer 	 s 	 	will	 analyz 	 e 	 	the	 image 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	human	 assist 	 ance 	 	to	summarize	them	in	a	 connect 	 ome 	 	.
I	do	not	know	,	but	I	hope	that	I	will	live	to	see	that	day	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 find 	 ing 	 	an	entire	human	 connect 	 ome 	 	is	one	of	the	 great 	 est 	 	 techno 	 logical 	 	 challeng 	 es 	 	of	all	time	.
It	will	take	the	work	of	 generation 	 s 	 	to	succeed	.
At	the	present	time	,	my	 collabor 	 ators 	 	and	I	,	what	we	're	 aim 	 ing 	 	for	is	much	more	modest	--	just	to	find	partial	 connect 	 ome 	 s 	 	of	 tin 	 y 	 	 chunk 	 s 	 	of	mouse	and	human	brain	.
But	even	that	will	be	 en 	 ough 	 	for	the	first	 test 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 hypo 	 thesis 	 	that	I	am	my	 connect 	 ome 	 	.
For	now	,	let	me	try	to	 con 	 vince 	 	you	of	the	 pla 	 us 	 ibility 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 hypo 	 thesis 	 	,	that	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	worth	taking	 serious 	 ly 	 	.
 A 	 s 	 	you	grow	 dur 	 ing 	 	 child 	 hood 	 	and	age	 dur 	 ing 	 	 adult 	 hood 	 	,	your	personal	 ident 	 ity 	 	 change 	 s 	 	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	.
 Like 	 wise 	 	,	every	 connect 	 ome 	 	 change 	 s 	 	over	time	.
What	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 change 	 s 	 	happen	?
Well	,	 neuro 	 ns 	 	,	like	 tree 	 s 	 	,	can	grow	new	 branch 	 es 	 	,	and	they	can	lose	old	 one 	 s 	 	.
Synapses	can	be	 create 	 d 	 	,	and	they	can	be	 eliminate 	 d 	 	.
And	 synapse 	 s 	 	can	grow	 large 	 r 	 	,	and	they	can	grow	 small 	 er 	 	.
Second	question	:	what	 cause 	 s 	 	these	 change 	 s 	 	?
Well	,	it	's	true	.
To	some	 ex 	 tent 	 	,	they	are	 programm 	 ed 	 	by	your	 gene 	 s 	 	.
But	that	's	not	the	whole	story	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	are	 signal 	 s 	 	,	 electric 	 al 	 	 signal 	 s 	 	,	that	travel	 a 	 long 	 	the	 branch 	 es 	 	of	 neuro 	 ns 	 	and	chemical	 signal 	 s 	 	that	jump	 a 	 cross 	 	from	branch	to	branch	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	 signal 	 s 	 	are	 call 	 ed 	 	neural	activity	.
And	there	's	a	lot	of	evidence	that	neural	activity	is	 en 	 cod 	 ing 	 	our	 thought 	 s 	 	,	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	and	 per 	 ception 	 s 	 	,	our	mental	 experience 	 s 	 	.
And	there	's	a	lot	of	evidence	that	neural	activity	can	cause	your	 connect 	 ions 	 	to	change	.
And	if	you	put	 t 	 hose 	 	two	 fact 	 s 	 	together	,	it	 mean 	 s 	 	that	your	 experience 	 s 	 	can	change	your	 connect 	 ome 	 	.
And	that	's	why	every	 connect 	 ome 	 	is	 un 	 ique 	 	,	even	 t 	 hose 	 	of	 genetic 	 ally 	 	 ident 	 ical 	 	 t 	 win 	 s 	 	.
The	 connect 	 ome 	 	is	where	nature	 meet 	 s 	 	nurture	.
And	it	might	true	that	just	the	mere	act	of	 think 	 ing 	 	can	change	your	 connect 	 ome 	 	--	an	idea	that	you	may	find	 empower 	 ing 	 	.
What	's	in	 th 	 is 	 	picture	?
A	cool	and	 re 	 fresh 	 ing 	 	stream	of	water	,	you	say	.
What	else	is	in	 th 	 is 	 	picture	?
Do	not	forget	that	groove	in	the	Earth	 call 	 ed 	 	the	stream	bed	.
 With 	 out 	 	it	,	the	water	would	not	know	in	which	direction	to	flow	.
And	with	the	stream	,	I	would	like	to	 pro 	 pose 	 	a	metaphor	for	the	relationship	between	neural	activity	and	 connect 	 ivity 	 	.
 Ne 	 ural 	 	activity	is	 constant 	 ly 	 	changing	.
It	's	like	the	water	of	the	stream	;	it	never	 s 	 it 	 s 	 	still	.
The	 connect 	 ions 	 	of	the	brain	's	neural	network	 determine 	 s 	 	the	 path 	 ways 	 	 a 	 long 	 	which	neural	activity	 flow 	 s 	 	.
And	so	the	 connect 	 ome 	 	is	like	bed	of	the	stream	;	but	the	metaphor	is	 rich 	 er 	 	than	that	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	true	that	the	stream	bed	 guide 	 s 	 	the	flow	of	the	water	,	but	over	long	 time 	 scale 	 s 	 	,	the	water	 al 	 so 	 	 re 	 shape 	 s 	 	the	bed	of	the	stream	.
And	 a 	 s 	 	I	told	you	just	now	,	neural	activity	can	change	the	 connect 	 ome 	 	.
And	if	you	'll	allow	me	to	ascend	to	 metaphor 	 ical 	 	 height 	 s 	 	,	I	will	 re 	 mind 	 	you	that	neural	activity	is	the	physical	 bas 	 is 	 	--	or	so	 neuro 	 scientist 	 s 	 	think	--	of	 thought 	 s 	 	,	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	and	 per 	 ception 	 s 	 	.
And	so	we	might	even	speak	of	the	stream	of	 conscious 	 ness 	 	.
 Ne 	 ural 	 	activity	is	 it 	 s 	 	water	,	and	the	 connect 	 ome 	 	is	 it 	 s 	 	bed	.
So	let	's	return	from	the	 height 	 s 	 	of	metaphor	and	return	to	science	.
 Sup 	 pose 	 	our	 techno 	 logies 	 	for	 find 	 ing 	 	 connect 	 ome 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	work	.
How	will	we	go	about	 test 	 ing 	 	the	 hypo 	 thesis 	 	``	I	am	my	 connect 	 ome 	 	?	''
Well	,	I	 pro 	 pose 	 	a	direct	test	.
Let	us	attempt	to	read	out	 memor 	 ies 	 	from	 connect 	 ome 	 s 	 	.
 Con 	 sider 	 	the	 memor 	 y 	 	of	long	temporal	 sequence 	 s 	 	of	 move 	 ments 	 	,	like	a	pianist	 play 	 ing 	 	a	 Bee 	 th 	 oven 	 	 son 	 ata 	 	.
 Accord 	 ing 	 	to	a	 theor 	 y 	 	that	 date 	 s 	 	back	to	the	19th	century	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 memor 	 ies 	 	are	 store 	 d 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 chain 	 s 	 	of	 syn 	 apt 	 ic 	 	 connect 	 ions 	 	 in 	 side 	 	your	brain	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	,	if	the	first	 neuro 	 ns 	 	in	the	chain	are	 activate 	 d 	 	,	through	 the 	 ir 	 	 synapse 	 s 	 	they	 s 	 end 	 	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	to	the	second	 neuro 	 ns 	 	,	which	are	 activate 	 d 	 	,	and	so	on	down	the	line	,	like	a	chain	of	 fall 	 ing 	 	 domin 	 o 	 es 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	sequence	of	neural	 activ 	 ation 	 	is	 hypothesize 	 d 	 	to	be	the	neural	 bas 	 is 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	sequence	of	 move 	 ments 	 	.
So	one	way	of	 try 	 ing 	 	to	test	the	 theor 	 y 	 	is	to	look	for	 s 	 uch 	 	 chain 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	 connect 	 ome 	 s 	 	.
But	it	wo	n't	be	easy	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	not	going	to	look	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	going	to	be	 scramble 	 d 	 	up	.
So	we	'll	have	to	use	our	 computer 	 s 	 	to	try	to	 un 	 scramble 	 	the	chain	.
And	if	we	can	do	that	,	the	sequence	of	the	 neuro 	 ns 	 	we	 re 	 cover 	 	from	that	 un 	 s 	 cram 	 bling 	 	will	be	a	 predict 	 ion 	 	of	the	pattern	of	neural	activity	that	is	 re 	 play 	 ed 	 	in	the	brain	 dur 	 ing 	 	 memor 	 y 	 	recall	.
And	if	that	 we 	 re 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	,	that	would	be	the	first	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 read 	 ing 	 	a	 memor 	 y 	 	from	a	 connect 	 ome 	 	.
What	a	mess	--	have	you	ever	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	wire	up	a	system	 a 	 s 	 	complex	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	?
I	hope	not	.
But	if	you	have	,	you	know	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	easy	to	make	a	 mistak 	 e 	 	.
The	 branch 	 es 	 	of	 neuro 	 ns 	 	are	like	the	 wire 	 s 	 	of	the	brain	.
Can	 any 	 one 	 	guess	:	what	's	the	total	length	of	 wire 	 s 	 	in	your	brain	?
I	'll	give	you	a	hint	.	It	's	a	big	number	.
I	estimate	,	 million 	 s 	 	of	 mile 	 s 	 	,	all	 pack 	 ed 	 	in	your	skull	.
And	if	you	appreciate	that	number	,	you	can	 eas 	 ily 	 	see	there	is	huge	potential	for	 mis 	 - 	 wiring 	 	of	the	brain	.
And	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	the	popular	press	 love 	 s 	 	 head 	 lines 	 	like	,	``	 An 	 ore 	 xic 	 	 brain 	 s 	 	are	wired	 different 	 ly 	 	,	''	or	``	 Aut 	 istic 	 	 brain 	 s 	 	are	wired	 different 	 ly 	 	.	''
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	plausible	 claim 	 s 	 	,	but	in	truth	,	we	ca	n't	see	the	brain	's	wiring	 clear 	 ly 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	to	tell	if	these	are	 re 	 ally 	 	true	.
And	so	the	 techno 	 logies 	 	for	 see 	 ing 	 	 connect 	 ome 	 s 	 	will	allow	us	to	 final 	 ly 	 	read	 mis 	 - 	 wiring 	 	of	the	brain	,	to	see	mental	 dis 	 order 	 s 	 	in	 connect 	 ome 	 s 	 	.
 Some 	 time 	 s 	 	the	best	way	to	test	a	 hypo 	 thesis 	 	is	to	consider	 it 	 s 	 	most	 extrem 	 e 	 	 implic 	 ation 	 	.
 Philosopher 	 s 	 	know	 th 	 is 	 	game	 ver 	 y 	 	well	.
If	you	 believ 	 e 	 	that	I	am	my	 connect 	 ome 	 	,	I	think	you	must	 al 	 so 	 	accept	the	idea	that	death	is	the	 destruct 	 ion 	 	of	your	 connect 	 ome 	 	.
I	 ment 	 ion 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	there	are	 prophet 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	who	claim	that	technology	will	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	alter	the	human	condition	and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	even	transform	the	human	species	.
One	of	 the 	 ir 	 	most	 cher 	 ish 	 ed 	 	 dream 	 s 	 	is	to	cheat	death	by	that	practice	known	 a 	 s 	 	 cryo 	 nic 	 s 	 	.
If	you	pay	100,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	you	can	arrange	to	have	your	body	 froze 	 n 	 	after	death	and	 store 	 d 	 	in	liquid	nitrogen	in	one	of	these	 tank 	 s 	 	in	an	Arizona	 ware 	 house 	 	,	 await 	 ing 	 	a	future	 civil 	 ization 	 	that	is	 advance 	 d 	 	to	resurrect	you	.
Should	we	 ridicul 	 e 	 	the	modern	 seek 	 ers 	 	of	 im 	 mortal 	 ity 	 	,	 call 	 ing 	 	them	 fool 	 s 	 	?
Or	will	they	 some 	 day 	 	 chuck 	 le 	 	over	our	 grave 	 s 	 	?
I	do	n't	know	--	I	prefer	to	test	 the 	 ir 	 	 belief 	 s 	 	,	 scientific 	 ally 	 	.
I	 pro 	 pose 	 	that	we	attempt	to	find	a	 connect 	 ome 	 	of	a	 froze 	 n 	 	brain	.
We	know	that	damage	to	the	brain	 occur 	 s 	 	after	death	and	 dur 	 ing 	 	freezing	.
The	question	is	:	 ha 	 s 	 	that	damage	 era 	 s 	 ed 	 	the	 connect 	 ome 	 	?
If	it	 ha 	 s 	 	,	there	is	no	way	that	any	future	 civil 	 ization 	 	will	be	able	to	 re 	 cover 	 	the	 memor 	 ies 	 	of	these	 froze 	 n 	 	 brain 	 s 	 	.
 Re 	 sur 	 re 	 ction 	 	might	succeed	for	the	body	,	but	not	for	the	mind	.
On	the	other	hand	,	if	the	 connect 	 ome 	 	is	still	 in 	 tact 	 	,	we	can	not	 ridicul 	 e 	 	the	 claim 	 s 	 	of	 cryo 	 nic 	 s 	 	so	 eas 	 ily 	 	.
I	've	 de 	 scribed 	 	a	quest	that	 begin 	 s 	 	in	the	world	of	the	 ver 	 y 	 	small	,	and	 propel 	 s 	 	us	to	the	world	of	the	far	future	.
 Connect 	 ome 	 s 	 	will	mark	a	 turn 	 ing 	 	point	in	human	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
 A 	 s 	 	we	 evolv 	 ed 	 	from	our	 ape 	 - 	 like 	 	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	on	the	African	savanna	,	what	 distinguish 	 ed 	 	us	was	our	 large 	 r 	 	 brain 	 s 	 	.
We	have	used	our	 brain 	 s 	 	to	fashion	ever	more	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	.
 Even 	 tu 	 ally 	 	,	these	 techno 	 logies 	 	will	 be 	 come 	 	so	 power 	 ful 	 	that	we	will	use	them	to	know	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	by	 de 	 construct 	 ing 	 	and	 re 	 construct 	 ing 	 	our	own	 brain 	 s 	 	.
I	 believ 	 e 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	voyage	of	 self 	 - 	 discover 	 y 	 	is	not	just	for	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	but	for	all	of	us	.
And	I	'm	 grat 	 e 	 ful 	 	for	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	share	 th 	 is 	 	voyage	with	you	 to 	 day 	 	.
Thank	you	.
 Z 	 ach 	 	 Ka 	 plan 	 	:	Keith	and	I	lead	a	research	team	.
We	investigate	 material 	 s 	 	and	 techno 	 logies 	 	that	have	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	 proper 	 ties 	 	.	Over	the	last	three	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	found	over	200	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	so	we	 look 	 ed 	 	back	 in 	 to 	 	our	library	and	 select 	 ed 	 	six	we	thought	would	be	most	surprising	for	TED	.
Of	these	six	,	the	first	one	that	we	're	going	to	talk	about	is	in	the	black	 envelop 	 e 	 	you	're	 hold 	 ing 	 	.
It	 come 	 s 	 	from	a	company	in	Japan	 call 	 ed 	 	 Gel 	 Tech 	 	.	 N 	 ow 	 	go	 a 	 head 	 	and	open	it	up	.
Keith	Schacht	:	 N 	 ow 	 	be	 s 	 ure 	 	and	take	the	two	 piece 	 s 	 	 a 	 part 	 	.
What	's	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	it	's	soft	,	but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	strong	magnet	.
 Z 	 ach 	 	and	I	have	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 fascinate 	 d 	 	 observ 	 ing 	 	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
We	 s 	 pent 	 	a	long	time	 think 	 ing 	 	about	why	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	and	it	's	just	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	that	we	 real 	 ized 	 	:	it	's	when	we	see	 some 	 thing 	 	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	,	it	 change 	 s 	 	our	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	the	way	 thing 	 s 	 	work	.
 A 	 s 	 	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	gel	magnet	for	the	first	time	,	if	you	 assum 	 e 	 	that	all	 magnet 	 s 	 	had	to	be	hard	,	then	 see 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 surprise 	 d 	 	you	and	it	 change 	 d 	 	your	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	the	way	 magnet 	 s 	 	could	work	.
 Z 	 K 	 	:	 N 	 ow 	 	,	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	understand	what	the	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	 proper 	 ties 	 	are	.
But	to	 re 	 ally 	 	think	about	the	 implic 	 ations 	 	of	what	 th 	 is 	 	 make 	 s 	 	possible	,	we	found	that	it	 help 	 s 	 	to	think	about	how	it	could	be	 appli 	 ed 	 	in	the	world	.
So	,	a	first	idea	is	to	use	it	on	cabinet	 door 	 s 	 	.
If	you	line	the	 side 	 s 	 	of	the	 cabinet 	 s 	 	using	the	gel	material	--	if	a	cabinet	 s 	 lam 	 s 	 	shut	it	would	n't	make	a	loud	noise	,	and	in	 add 	 ition 	 	the	 magnet 	 s 	 	would	draw	the	 cabinet 	 s 	 	closed	.
 Imagin 	 e 	 	taking	the	same	material	,	but	 put 	 ting 	 	it	on	the	bottom	of	a	 sneak 	 er 	 	.
You	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	way	you	could	go	to	the	 contain 	 er 	 	store	and	buy	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	metal	 sheet 	 s 	 	that	they	hang	on	the	back	of	your	door	,	in	your	 close 	 t 	 	,	and	you	could	 liter 	 ally 	 	stick	your	 shoe 	 s 	 	up	 in 	 stead 	 	of	using	a	shelf	.
For	me	,	I	 re 	 ally 	 	love	 th 	 is 	 	idea	.
If	you	come	to	my	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	and	see	my	 close 	 t 	 	,	I	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	you	'd	figure	out	why	:	it	's	a	mess	.
 K 	 S 	 	:	 See 	 ing 	 	the	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	 proper 	 ties 	 	and	then	 see 	 ing 	 	a	couple	of	 application 	 s 	 	--	it	 help 	 s 	 	you	see	why	 th 	 is 	 	is	significant	,	what	the	potential	is	.
But	we	've	found	that	the	way	we	present	our	 idea 	 s 	 	it	 make 	 s 	 	a	big	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
 Z 	 K 	 	:	It	was	like	six	 month 	 s 	 	ago	that	Keith	and	I	 we 	 re 	 	out	in	 L. 	 A. 	 	,	and	we	 we 	 re 	 	at	 Star 	 buck 	 s 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	coffee	with	 Ro 	 man 	 	 Cop 	 pol 	 a 	 	.
He	 work 	 s 	 	on	 most 	 ly 	 	music	 video 	 s 	 	and	 commercial 	 s 	 	with	his	company	,	The	 Direct 	 ors 	 	 Bur 	 eau 	 	.
 A 	 s 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	,	 Ro 	 man 	 	told	us	that	he	's	kind	of	an	inventor	on	the	side	.
And	we	 we 	 re 	 	 show 	 ing 	 	him	the	same	gel	magnet	that	you	're	 hold 	 ing 	 	in	your	hand	--	and	you	know	,	we	 share 	 d 	 	the	same	 idea 	 s 	 	.	And	you	could	see	it	in	his	face	:	 Ro 	 man 	 	 start 	 s 	 	to	get	 re 	 ally 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	and	he	 whip 	 s 	 	out	 th 	 is 	 	 man 	 ila 	 	 fold 	 er 	 	;	he	 open 	 s 	 	it	up	and	Keith	and	I	look	in	,	and	he	 start 	 s 	 	 show 	 ing 	 	us	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	that	he	's	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	just	get	him	 re 	 ally 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	.	And	so	we	're	looking	at	these	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	,	and	we	 we 	 re 	 	just	like	,	 who 	 a 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	guy	's	good	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	the	way	that	he	 present 	 ed 	 	the	 con 	 cept 	 	--	his	approach	was	 total 	 ly 	 	different	than	 our 	 s 	 	.	He	 s 	 old 	 	it	to	you	 a 	 s 	 	if	it	was	for	sale	right	now	.
When	we	 we 	 re 	 	going	in	the	car	back	to	the	 air 	 port 	 	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	:	why	was	 th 	 is 	 	so	 power 	 ful 	 	?
And	 a 	 s 	 	we	thought	about	it	more	,	we	 real 	 ized 	 	that	it	let	you	fill	in	all	the	 detail 	 s 	 	about	the	experience	,	just	 a 	 s 	 	if	you	saw	it	on	TV	.	So	,	for	TED	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	take	our	 favor 	 ite 	 	idea	for	the	gel	magnet	and	work	with	 Ro 	 man 	 	and	his	team	at	the	 Direct 	 ors 	 	 Bur 	 eau 	 	to	create	a	commercial	for	a	product	from	the	future	.
 Nar 	 rator 	 	:	Do	you	have	a	need	for	speed	?
 Invent 	 able 	 s 	 	Water	 Ad 	 venture 	 s 	 	 da 	 re 	 s 	 	you	to	launch	 your 	 self 	 	on	a	 magnet 	 ically 	 - 	 levit 	 ating 	 	board	down	a	 water 	 slide 	 	so	fast	,	so	tall	,	that	when	you	hit	the	bottom	,	it	uses	 brake 	 s 	 	to	stop	.
Aqua	Rocket	:	coming	 th 	 is 	 	summer	.
 K 	 S 	 	:	 N 	 ow 	 	,	we	 show 	 ed 	 	the	 con 	 cept 	 	to	a	few	people	before	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	they	 ask 	 ed 	 	us	,	when	's	it	coming	out	?
So	I	just	 want 	 ed 	 	to	let	you	know	,	it	's	not	 actual 	 ly 	 	coming	out	,	just	the	 con 	 cept 	 	is	.
 Z 	 K 	 	:	So	now	,	when	we	dream	up	these	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	,	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	for	us	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	they	work	from	a	technical	 stand 	 point 	 	.
So	I	just	want	to	 quick 	 ly 	 	explain	how	 th 	 is 	 	would	work	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	 magnet 	 ically 	 - 	 levit 	 ating 	 	board	that	they	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	in	the	commercial	.
The	gel	that	you	're	 hold 	 ing 	 	would	be	lining	the	bottom	of	the	board	.
 N 	 ow 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	 import 	 ant 	 	for	two	 reason 	 s 	 	.
One	:	the	soft	 proper 	 ties 	 	of	the	magnet	that	make	it	so	that	,	if	it	 we 	 re 	 	to	hit	the	rider	in	the	head	,	it	would	n't	 inju 	 re 	 	him	.
In	 add 	 ition 	 	,	you	can	see	from	the	 dia 	 gram 	 	on	the	right	,	the	 under 	 part 	 	of	the	slide	would	be	an	 electro 	 magnet 	 	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	would	 actual 	 ly 	 	repel	the	rider	a	little	bit	 a 	 s 	 	you	're	going	down	.
The	force	of	the	water	 rush 	 ing 	 	down	,	in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	that	 re 	 pulsion 	 	force	,	would	make	 th 	 is 	 	slide	go	 fast 	 er 	 	than	any	slide	on	the	market	.
It	's	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	that	you	need	the	 magnet 	 ic 	 	 bra 	 king 	 	system	.
When	you	get	to	the	 ver 	 y 	 	bottom	of	the	slide	--	--	the	rider	 pass 	 es 	 	through	an	 a 	 lumin 	 um 	 	tube	.
And	I	'm	going	to	kick	it	to	Keith	to	explain	why	that	's	 import 	 ant 	 	from	a	technical	 stand 	 point 	 	.
 K 	 S 	 	:	So	I	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	all	you	 engineer 	 s 	 	know	that	even	 th 	 ough 	 	 a 	 lumin 	 um 	 	is	a	metal	,	it	's	not	a	 magnet 	 ic 	 	material	.	But	 some 	 thing 	 	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	when	you	drop	a	magnet	down	an	 a 	 lumin 	 um 	 	tube	.
So	we	set	up	a	quick	experiment	here	to	show	that	to	you	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	you	see	the	magnet	fell	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	I	'm	not	going	to	get	 in 	 to 	 	the	physics	of	it	,	but	all	you	need	to	know	is	that	the	 fast 	 er 	 	the	magnet	's	 fall 	 ing 	 	,	the	 great 	 er 	 	the	 stop 	 ping 	 	force	.
 Z 	 K 	 	:	 N 	 ow 	 	,	our	next	technology	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	10-foot	pole	,	and	I	have	it	right	here	in	my	pocket	.
There	're	a	few	different	 version 	 s 	 	of	it	.
 K 	 S 	 	:	Some	of	them	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	 un 	 roll 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	one	.
 The 	 y 	 	can	be	made	to	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	roll	up	,	or	they	can	be	made	 s 	 table 	 	,	like	 Z 	 ach 	 	's	,	to	hold	any	position	in	between	.
 Z 	 K 	 	:	 A 	 s 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	the	 vend 	 or 	 	--	to	try	to	learn	about	how	you	could	 app 	 ly 	 	these	,	or	how	they	're	 be 	 ing 	 	 appli 	 ed 	 	 current 	 ly 	 	--	he	was	 tell 	 ing 	 	us	that	,	in	the	 militar 	 y 	 	they	use	 th 	 is 	 	one	so	 soldier 	 s 	 	can	keep	it	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 chest 	 s 	 	--	 ver 	 y 	 	 conceal 	 ed 	 	--	and	then	,	when	they	're	out	on	the	field	,	erect	it	 a 	 s 	 	an	antenna	to	 clear 	 ly 	 	 s 	 end 	 	 signal 	 s 	 	back	to	the	base	.
In	our	 brain 	 storm 	 s 	 	,	we	came	up	with	the	idea	you	could	use	it	for	a	soccer	goal	:	so	at	the	end	of	the	game	,	you	just	roll	up	the	goal	and	put	it	in	your	gym	bag	.
 K 	 S 	 	:	 N 	 ow 	 	,	the	 interest 	 ing 	 	thing	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	you	do	n't	have	to	be	an	engineer	to	appreciate	why	a	10-foot	pole	that	can	fit	in	your	pocket	is	so	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
So	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	go	out	onto	the	 street 	 s 	 	of	 Chi 	 cago 	 	and	ask	a	few	people	on	the	 street 	 s 	 	what	they	thought	you	could	do	with	 th 	 is 	 	.
Man	:	I	clean	my	 ceil 	 ing 	 	 fan 	 s 	 	with	that	and	I	get	the	spider	 web 	 s 	 	off	my	house	--	I	do	it	that	way	.
 Wo 	 man 	 	:	I	'd	make	my	 ver 	 y 	 	own	 walk 	 ing 	 	stick	.
 Wo 	 man 	 	:	I	would	create	a	 lad 	 der 	 	to	use	to	get	up	on	top	of	the	tree	.
 Wo 	 man 	 	:	An	 o 	 live 	 	 serv 	 er 	 	.
Man	:	Some	type	of	 extens 	 ion 	 	pole	--	like	what	the	 paint 	 ers 	 	use	.
 Wo 	 man 	 	:	I	would	make	a	spear	that	,	when	you	went	deep	sea	 div 	 ing 	 	,	you	could	catch	the	fish	 re 	 ally 	 	fast	,	and	then	roll	it	back	up	,	and	you	could	swim	 eas 	 ier 	 	...	Yeah	.
 Z 	 K 	 	:	 N 	 ow 	 	,	for	our	next	technology	we	're	going	to	do	a	little	 demonst 	 ration 	 	,	and	so	we	need	a	volunteer	from	the	audience	.
You	 s 	 ir 	 	,	come	on	up	.
Come	on	up	.	Tell	 every 	 body 	 	your	name	.
 St 	 eve 	 	 Ju 	 r 	 vet 	 son 	 	:	 St 	 eve 	 	.
 Z 	 K 	 	:	It	's	 St 	 eve 	 	.	All	right	 St 	 eve 	 	,	now	,	follow	me	.
We	need	you	to	stand	right	in	front	of	the	TED	sign	.
Right	there	.	That	's	great	.
And	hold	onto	 th 	 is 	 	.	Good	luck	to	you	.
 K 	 S 	 	:	No	,	not	yet	.
 Z 	 K 	 	:	I	'd	just	like	to	let	you	all	know	that	 th 	 is 	 	 present 	 ation 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	to	you	by	Target	.
 K 	 S 	 	:	 Li 	 ttle 	 	bit	--	that	's	perfect	,	just	perfect	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	 Z 	 ach 	 	,	we	're	going	to	 demonst 	 rate 	 	a	water	gun	fight	from	the	future	.
So	here	,	come	on	up	to	the	front	.	All	right	,	so	now	if	you	'll	see	here	--	no	,	no	,	it	's	 O 	 K 	 	.
So	,	 de 	 scribe 	 	to	the	audience	the	temperature	of	your	shirt	.	Go	 a 	 head 	 	.
 S 	 J 	 	:	It	's	cold	.
 K 	 S 	 	:	 N 	 ow 	 	the	reason	it	's	cold	is	that	's	it	's	not	 actual 	 ly 	 	water	 load 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	these	squirt	 gun 	 s 	 	--	it	's	a	dry	liquid	 develop 	 ed 	 	by	3M	.
It	's	 perfect 	 ly 	 	clear	,	it	's	 odor 	 less 	 	,	it	's	 color 	 less 	 	.
It	's	so	safe	you	could	drink	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	.
And	the	reason	it	 feel 	 s 	 	cold	is	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 evapo 	 rates 	 	25	 time 	 s 	 	 fast 	 er 	 	than	water	.
All	right	,	well	 thank 	 s 	 	for	coming	up	.
 Z 	 K 	 	:	Wait	,	wait	,	Steven	--	before	you	go	we	 fill 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	with	the	dry	liquid	so	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	break	you	can	shoot	your	 friend 	 s 	 	.
 S 	 J 	 	:	 Excel 	 lent 	 	,	thank	you	.
 K 	 S 	 	:	 Thank 	 s 	 	for	coming	up	.	Let	's	give	him	a	big	round	of	 app 	 laus 	 e 	 	.
So	what	's	the	 sign 	 ific 	 ance 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	dry	liquid	?
 Ear 	 ly 	 	 version 	 s 	 	of	the	fluid	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	used	on	a	 C 	 ray 	 	 Super 	 computer 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	the	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	thing	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	 Z 	 ach 	 	could	stand	up	on	stage	and	drench	a	 perfect 	 ly 	 	 innoc 	 ent 	 	member	of	the	audience	 with 	 out 	 	any	concern	that	we	'd	damage	the	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	,	that	we	'd	get	him	wet	,	that	we	'd	hurt	the	 book 	 s 	 	or	the	 computer 	 s 	 	.	It	 work 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 non 	 - 	 conduct 	 ive 	 	.
So	you	can	see	here	,	you	can	 immers 	 e 	 	a	whole	circuit	board	in	 th 	 is 	 	and	it	would	n't	cause	any	damage	.
You	can	 circul 	 ate 	 	it	to	draw	the	heat	away	.
But	 to 	 day 	 	it	's	most	 wide 	 ly 	 	used	in	 off 	 ice 	 	 building 	 s 	 	--	in	the	 sprinkl 	 er 	 	system	--	 a 	 s 	 	a	 fire 	 - 	 suppress 	 ion 	 	fluid	.
 Aga 	 in 	 	,	it	's	 perfect 	 ly 	 	safe	for	people	.	It	 put 	 s 	 	out	the	 fire 	 s 	 	,	 do 	 es 	 	n't	hurt	 any 	 thing 	 	.
But	our	 favor 	 ite 	 	idea	for	 th 	 is 	 	was	using	it	in	a	 basket 	 ball 	 	game	.	So	 dur 	 ing 	 	 half 	 time 	 	,	it	could	rain	down	on	the	 player 	 s 	 	,	cool	 every 	 one 	 	down	,	and	in	a	matter	of	 minute 	 s 	 	it	would	dry	.	Would	n't	hurt	the	court	.
 Z 	 K 	 	:	Our	next	technology	 come 	 s 	 	to	us	from	a	company	in	Japan	 call 	 ed 	 	Sekisui	 Chem 	 ical 	 	.	One	of	 the 	 ir 	 	R	&	amp	;	D	 engineer 	 s 	 	was	 work 	 ing 	 	on	a	way	to	make	plastic	 stiff 	 er 	 	.
 Whi 	 le 	 	he	was	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	he	 notice 	 d 	 	an	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	thing	.
We	have	a	video	to	show	you	.
 K 	 S 	 	:	So	you	see	there	,	it	did	n't	 bounc 	 e 	 	back	.	 N 	 ow 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	an	 un 	 intend 	 ed 	 	side	effect	of	some	 experiment 	 s 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	.
It	's	 technical 	 ly 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	,	``	 shape 	 - 	 retain 	 ing 	 	 proper 	 ty 	 	.	''
 N 	 ow 	 	,	think	about	your	 interact 	 ions 	 	with	 a 	 lumin 	 um 	 	foil	.
 Shape 	 - 	 retain 	 ing 	 	is	common	in	metal	:	you	bend	a	piece	of	 a 	 lumin 	 um 	 	foil	,	and	it	 hold 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	place	.	 Contra 	 st 	 	that	with	a	plastic	garbage	can	--	and	you	can	push	in	the	 side 	 s 	 	and	it	 al 	 ways 	 	 bounc 	 es 	 	back	.
 Z 	 K 	 	:	For	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	you	could	make	a	watch	that	 wrap 	 s 	 	around	your	wrist	,	but	 do 	 es 	 	n't	use	a	 buck 	 le 	 	.
 Ta 	 king 	 	it	a	little	further	,	if	you	wove	 t 	 hose 	 	 strip 	 s 	 	together	--	kind	of	like	a	little	basket	--	you	could	make	a	 shape 	 - 	 retain 	 ing 	 	sheet	,	and	then	you	could	embed	it	in	a	cloth	:	so	you	could	make	a	picnic	sheet	that	 wrap 	 s 	 	around	the	table	,	so	that	way	on	a	 wind 	 y 	 	day	it	would	n't	blow	away	.
For	our	next	technology	,	it	's	hard	to	 observ 	 e 	 	the	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	 proper 	 ty 	 	by	 it 	 self 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	an	ink	.
So	,	we	've	prepared	a	video	to	show	it	 appli 	 ed 	 	to	paper	.
 K 	 S 	 	:	 A 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	paper	is	 bend 	 ing 	 	,	the	 resist 	 ance 	 	of	the	ink	 change 	 s 	 	.
So	with	simple	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	,	you	can	detect	how	much	the	page	is	 be 	 ing 	 	bent	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	to	think	about	the	potential	for	 th 	 is 	 	,	think	of	all	the	 place 	 s 	 	ink	is	 suppli 	 ed 	 	:	on	business	 card 	 s 	 	,	on	the	back	of	 ce 	 real 	 	boxes	,	board	 game 	 s 	 	.	Any	place	you	use	ink	,	you	could	change	the	way	you	interact	with	it	.
 Z 	 K 	 	:	So	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	idea	for	 th 	 is 	 	is	to	 app 	 ly 	 	the	ink	to	a	book	.
 Th 	 is 	 	could	 total 	 ly 	 	change	the	way	that	you	 inter 	 face 	 	with	paper	.
You	see	the	dark	line	on	the	side	and	the	top	.	 A 	 s 	 	you	turn	the	 page 	 s 	 	of	the	book	,	the	book	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	detect	what	page	you	're	on	,	based	on	the	 curv 	 ature 	 	of	the	 page 	 s 	 	.
In	 add 	 ition 	 	,	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	to	fold	in	one	of	the	 corner 	 s 	 	,	then	you	could	program	the	book	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	email	you	the	text	on	the	page	for	your	 note 	 s 	 	.
 K 	 S 	 	:	For	our	last	technology	,	we	 work 	 ed 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	with	 Ro 	 man 	 	and	his	team	at	the	 Direct 	 ors 	 	 Bur 	 eau 	 	to	develop	a	commercial	from	the	future	to	explain	how	it	 work 	 s 	 	.
Old	 Mil 	 k 	 	 Car 	 ton 	 	:	Oh	 yea 	 h 	 	,	it	 smell 	 s 	 	good	.
Who	are	you	?
New	 Mil 	 k 	 	 Car 	 ton 	 	:	I	'm	New	 Mil 	 k 	 	.
 O 	 MC 	 	:	I	used	to	smell	like	you	.
 Nar 	 rator 	 	:	Fresh	 Wat 	 ch 	 	,	from	 Invent 	 able 	 s 	 	 Dai 	 ry 	 	 Farm 	 s 	 	.
 Pack 	 aging 	 	that	 change 	 s 	 	color	when	your	milk	's	gone	off	.
Do	n't	let	milk	spoil	your	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
 Z 	 K 	 	:	 N 	 ow 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	technology	was	 develop 	 ed 	 	by	these	two	 guy 	 s 	 	:	 Profess 	 or 	 	Ken	 Su 	 s 	 lick 	 	and	 Ne 	 il 	 	 Ra 	 kow 	 	,	of	the	 Univers 	 ity 	 	of	 Ill 	 ino 	 is 	 	.
 K 	 S 	 	:	 N 	 ow 	 	the	way	it	 work 	 s 	 	:	there	's	a	 m 	 atrix 	 	of	color	 dye 	 s 	 	.
And	these	 dye 	 s 	 	change	color	in	 respons 	 e 	 	to	 odor 	 s 	 	.
So	the	smell	of	 van 	 illa 	 	,	that	might	change	the	four	on	the	left	to	 brow 	 n 	 	and	the	one	on	the	right	to	yellow	.	 Th 	 is 	 	 m 	 atrix 	 	can	produce	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	different	color	 combination 	 s 	 	to	represent	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	different	 smell 	 s 	 	.
But	like	in	the	milk	commercial	,	if	you	know	what	odor	you	want	to	detect	,	then	they	can	 form 	 ulate 	 	a	specific	dye	to	detect	just	that	odor	.
 Z 	 K 	 	:	Right	.	It	was	that	that	 start 	 ed 	 	a	conversation	with	 Profess 	 or 	 	 Su 	 s 	 lick 	 	and	 my 	 self 	 	,	and	he	was	 explain 	 ing 	 	to	me	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	making	possible	,	beyond	just	 detect 	 ing 	 	 spoil 	 ed 	 	food	.	It	's	 re 	 ally 	 	where	the	 sign 	 ific 	 ance 	 	of	it	lies	.
 Hi 	 s 	 	company	 actual 	 ly 	 	did	a	survey	of	 fire 	 men 	 	all	 a 	 cross 	 	the	country	to	try	to	learn	,	how	are	they	 current 	 ly 	 	 test 	 ing 	 	the	air	when	they	respond	to	an	 emerge 	 ncy 	 	scene	?
And	he	kind	of	 com 	 ically 	 	 explain 	 ed 	 	that	time	after	time	,	what	the	 fire 	 men 	 	would	say	is	:	they	would	rush	to	the	scene	of	the	crime	;	they	would	look	around	;	if	there	 we 	 re 	 	no	dead	 police 	 men 	 	,	it	was	 O 	 K 	 	to	go	.
I	mean	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	true	story	.	 The 	 y 	 	're	using	 police 	 men 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 can 	 aries 	 	.
But	more	 serious 	 ly 	 	,	they	 determine 	 d 	 	that	you	could	develop	a	 de 	 vice 	 	that	can	smell	better	than	the	 human 	 s 	 	,	and	say	if	it	's	safe	for	the	 fire 	 men 	 	.
In	 add 	 ition 	 	,	he	's	 s 	 pun 	 	off	a	company	from	the	 Univers 	 ity 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 Chem 	 Sen 	 s 	 ing 	 	,	where	they	're	 work 	 ing 	 	on	medical	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	.
So	,	a	patient	can	come	in	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	blow	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	.
By	 detect 	 ing 	 	the	odor	of	 part 	 icular 	 	bacteria	,	or	viruses	,	or	even	lung	cancer	,	the	 dot 	 s 	 	will	change	and	they	can	use	 soft 	 ware 	 	to	 analyz 	 e 	 	the	 result 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	can	 radical 	 ly 	 	improve	the	way	that	 doctor 	 s 	 	 diagnos 	 e 	 	 patient 	 s 	 	.
 Current 	 ly 	 	,	they	're	using	a	method	of	trial	and	error	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	could	tell	you	 precise 	 ly 	 	what	disease	you	have	.
 K 	 S 	 	:	So	that	was	the	six	we	had	for	you	 to 	 day 	 	,	but	I	hope	you	're	 start 	 ing 	 	to	see	why	we	find	these	 thing 	 s 	 	so	 fasci 	 nating 	 	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	every	one	of	these	six	 change 	 d 	 	our	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	what	was	possible	in	the	world	.	 Pr 	 ior 	 	to	 see 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	would	have	 assum 	 ed 	 	:	a	10-foot	pole	could	n't	fit	in	your	pocket	;	 some 	 thing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 in 	 expensive 	 	 a 	 s 	 	ink	could	n't	sense	the	way	paper	is	 be 	 ing 	 	bent	;	every	one	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	--	and	we	're	 constant 	 ly 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	find	more	.
 Z 	 K 	 	:	 Th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	Keith	and	I	 re 	 ally 	 	enjoy	 do 	 ing 	 	.
I	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	it	's	obvious	to	you	now	,	but	it	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 yester 	 day 	 	that	I	was	 re 	 minded 	 	of	why	.	I	was	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	conversation	with	 St 	 eve 	 	 Ju 	 r 	 vet 	 son 	 	,	over	 down 	 stair 	 s 	 	by	the	 escal 	 ators 	 	,	and	he	was	 tell 	 ing 	 	me	that	when	Chris	 s 	 ent 	 	out	that	little	box	,	one	of	the	 item 	 s 	 	in	it	was	the	 hydro 	 phobic 	 	sand	--	the	sand	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	get	wet	.	He	 s 	 aid 	 	that	he	was	 play 	 ing 	 	with	it	with	his	son	.
And	you	know	,	his	son	was	 mesmer 	 ized 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	he	would	dunk	it	in	the	water	,	he	would	take	it	out	and	it	was	bone	dry	.	A	few	 week 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	that	his	son	was	 play 	 ing 	 	with	a	lock	of	his	mother	's	hair	,	and	he	 notice 	 d 	 	that	there	 we 	 re 	 	some	 drop 	 s 	 	of	water	on	the	hair	.
And	he	took	the	thing	and	he	 look 	 ed 	 	up	to	 St 	 eve 	 	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Look	,	 hydro 	 phobic 	 	string	.	''
I	mean	,	after	 hear 	 ing 	 	that	story	--	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 summ 	 ed 	 	it	up	for	me	.
Thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
 K 	 S 	 	:	Thank	you	.
I	went	to	 Spa 	 in 	 	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	ago	and	I	had	the	best	 fo 	 ie 	 	 gra 	 s 	 	of	my	life	.
The	best	 cul 	 in 	 ary 	 	experience	of	my	life	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	what	I	saw	,	I	'm	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	,	is	the	future	of	 cook 	 ing 	 	.
 Ridicul 	 ous 	 	,	right	?
 Fo 	 ie 	 	 gra 	 s 	 	and	the	future	of	 cook 	 ing 	 	.
There	's	not	a	food	 to 	 day 	 	that	's	more	 malign 	 ed 	 	than	 fo 	 ie 	 	 gra 	 s 	 	,	right	?
I	mean	,	it	's	 cruc 	 ified 	 	.
It	was	 out 	 law 	 ed 	 	in	 Chi 	 cago 	 	for	a	while	.
It	's	 pend 	 ing 	 	here	in	California	,	and	just	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	in	New	York	.
It	's	like	if	you	're	a	chef	and	you	put	it	on	your	menu	,	you	risk	 be 	 ing 	 	 attack 	 ed 	 	.
 Re 	 ally 	 	,	it	 happen 	 ed 	 	here	in	San	 Francis 	 co 	 	to	a	famous	chef	.
I	'm	not	 say 	 ing 	 	that	there	's	not	a	 rational 	 e 	 	for	 be 	 ing 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	 fo 	 ie 	 	 gra 	 s 	 	.
The	 reason 	 s 	 	 usual 	 ly 	 	just	boil	down	to	the	 ga 	 vage 	 	,	which	is	the	force	 feed 	 ing 	 	.
 Bas 	 ically 	 	you	take	a	goose	or	a	duck	and	you	force	feed	a	ton	of	grain	down	 it 	 s 	 	throat	.
 Mo 	 re 	 	grain	in	a	couple	of	 week 	 s 	 	than	it	would	ever	get	in	a	 life 	 time 	 	.
 It 	 s 	 	liver	 expand 	 s 	 	by	eight	 time 	 s 	 	.
 Su 	 ff 	 ice 	 	to	say	it	's	like	--	it	's	not	the	 pre 	 t 	 tiest 	 	picture	of	 sustain 	 able 	 	 farm 	 ing 	 	.
The	problem	for	us	 chef 	 s 	 	is	that	it	's	so	 freak 	 in 	 	'	 delic 	 ious 	 	.
I	mean	,	I	love	the	stuff	.
It	is	fatty	,	it	's	sweet	,	it	's	 silk 	 y 	 	,	it	's	 un 	 ctu 	 ous 	 	.
It	 make 	 s 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	else	you	put	it	with	taste	 in 	 credible 	 	.
Can	we	produce	a	menu	that	's	 delic 	 ious 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 fo 	 ie 	 	 gra 	 s 	 	?
Yes	,	 s 	 ure 	 	.
You	can	 al 	 so 	 	bike	the	Tour	de	 Franc 	 e 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 steroid 	 s 	 	,	right	?
Not	a	lot	of	people	are	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
And	for	good	reason	.
So	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 month 	 s 	 	ago	,	a	friend	of	mine	 s 	 ent 	 	me	 th 	 is 	 	link	to	 th 	 is 	 	guy	,	Eduardo	 S 	 ous 	 a 	 	.
Eduardo	is	 do 	 ing 	 	what	he	 call 	 s 	 	natural	 fo 	 ie 	 	 gra 	 s 	 	.
Natural	 fo 	 ie 	 	 gra 	 s 	 	.
What	's	natural	about	 fo 	 ie 	 	 gra 	 s 	 	?
To	take	advantage	of	when	the	temperature	 drop 	 s 	 	in	the	fall	,	 ge 	 ese 	 	and	 duck 	 s 	 	gorge	on	food	to	 prep 	 are 	 	for	the	harsh	 real 	 ities 	 	of	winter	.
And	the	rest	of	the	year	they	're	free	to	roam	around	Eduardo	's	land	and	eat	what	they	want	.
So	no	 ga 	 vage 	 	,	no	force	 feed 	 ing 	 	,	no	 factor 	 y 	 - 	 like 	 	 condition 	 s 	 	,	no	 cruel 	 ty 	 	.
And	it	's	 shock 	 ing 	 ly 	 	not	a	new	idea	.
 Hi 	 s 	 	 great 	 - 	 grand 	 dad 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	--	 Pat 	 ería 	 	de	 S 	 ous 	 a 	 	--	in	1812	.
And	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	it	 quiet 	 ly 	 	ever	since	.
That	is	 un 	 til 	 	last	year	,	when	Eduardo	won	the	 Co 	 up 	 	de	 Co 	 eur 	 	,	the	 cove 	 ted 	 	French	gastronomic	prize	.
It	's	like	the	 Olymp 	 ic 	 s 	 	of	food	 product 	 s 	 	.
He	 place 	 d 	 	first	for	his	 fo 	 ie 	 	 gra 	 s 	 	.
Big	,	big	problem	.
 A 	 s 	 	he	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	,	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 piss 	 ed 	 	the	French	off	.
He	 s 	 aid 	 	it	sort	of	 glee 	 fully 	 	.
It	was	all	over	the	 paper 	 s 	 	.
I	read	about	it	.	It	was	in	Le	 Mon 	 de 	 	.
``	 Spa 	 nish 	 	chef	 accus 	 ed 	 	...	``	--	and	the	French	 accus 	 ed 	 	him	.
``	 Spa 	 nish 	 	chef	 accus 	 ed 	 	of	 cheat 	 ing 	 	.	''
 The 	 y 	 	 accus 	 ed 	 	him	of	 pay 	 ing 	 	off	the	 judg 	 es 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	 implic 	 ated 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	the	 Spa 	 nish 	 	government	,	 amaz 	 ing 	 ly 	 	.
 Hu 	 h 	 	,	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
A	huge	scandal	for	a	few	 week 	 s 	 	.
 Cou 	 ld 	 	n't	find	a	shred	of	evidence	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	look	at	the	guy	.
He	 do 	 es 	 	n't	look	like	a	guy	who	's	 pay 	 ing 	 	off	French	 judg 	 es 	 	for	his	 fo 	 ie 	 	 gra 	 s 	 	.
So	that	 di 	 ed 	 	down	,	and	 ver 	 y 	 	soon	 after 	 ward 	 	,	new	 contr 	 over 	 s 	 y 	 	.
He	should	n't	win	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	not	 fo 	 ie 	 	 gra 	 s 	 	.
It	's	not	 fo 	 ie 	 	 gra 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	not	 ga 	 vage 	 	.
There	's	no	force	 feed 	 ing 	 	.
So	by	definition	,	he	's	 ly 	 ing 	 	and	should	be	 dis 	 qual 	 ified 	 	.
 A 	 s 	 	funny	 a 	 s 	 	it	 sound 	 s 	 	,	 articul 	 ating 	 	it	now	and	 read 	 ing 	 	about	it	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	if	we	had	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	it	before	 th 	 is 	 	 contr 	 over 	 s 	 y 	 	,	I	would	have	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	That	's	kind	of	true	.	''
You	know	,	 fo 	 ie 	 	 gra 	 s 	 	by	definition	,	force	 feed 	 ing 	 	,	it	's	 ga 	 vage 	 	,	and	that	's	what	you	get	when	you	want	 fo 	 ie 	 	 gra 	 s 	 	.
That	is	,	 un 	 til 	 	I	went	to	Eduardo	's	farm	in	 Ex 	 trem 	 ad 	 ura 	 	,	50	 mile 	 s 	 	north	of	 Se 	 ville 	 	,	right	on	the	 Port 	 ug 	 al 	 	border	.
I	saw	 first 	 - 	 hand 	 	a	system	that	is	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	complex	and	then	at	the	same	time	,	like	 every 	 thing 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	in	nature	,	is	 utter 	 ly 	 	simple	.
And	he	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	,	 re 	 ally 	 	from	the	first	moment	,	my	life	's	work	is	to	give	the	 ge 	 ese 	 	what	they	want	.
He	 repeat 	 ed 	 	that	about	50	 time 	 s 	 	in	the	two	 day 	 s 	 	I	was	with	him	.
I	'm	just	here	to	give	the	 ge 	 ese 	 	what	they	want	.
 Actu 	 ally 	 	,	when	I	 show 	 ed 	 	up	he	was	 ly 	 ing 	 	down	with	the	 ge 	 ese 	 	with	his	cell	phone	taking	 picture 	 s 	 	of	them	like	his	children	in	the	grass	.
 Amaz 	 ing 	 	.
He	's	 re 	 ally 	 	just	in	love	with	--	he	's	at	one	with	--	he	's	the	goose	 whisper 	 er 	 	.
And	when	I	was	 s 	 peaking 	 	to	him	,	you	know	,	I	thought	,	like	I	'm	 s 	 peaking 	 	to	you	now	,	right	,	but	sort	of	in	the	middle	of	my	 question 	 s 	 	,	my	 excit 	 ed 	 	 question 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	more	I	got	to	know	him	and	his	system	,	the	more	 excit 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	whole	idea	 be 	 came 	 	.
He	 ke 	 pt 	 	going	like	 th 	 is 	 	to	me	.
And	I	thought	,	 O 	 K 	 	,	 excit 	 ed 	 	Jew	from	New	York	,	right	?
I	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	a	little	too	 aggress 	 ively 	 	,	 what 	 ever 	 	,	so	you	know	,	I	 s 	 low 	 ed 	 	down	.
And	 final 	 ly 	 	,	by	the	end	of	the	day	I	was	like	,	 Ed 	 - 	 uar 	 - 	 do 	 	,	you	know	like	 th 	 is 	 	?
But	he	was	still	going	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
I	 figur 	 ed 	 	it	out	.
I	was	 s 	 peaking 	 	too	 loud 	 ly 	 	.
So	I	 hush 	 ed 	 	my	voice	.
I	kind	of	like	 ask 	 ed 	 	these	 question 	 s 	 	and	 chat 	 ted 	 	with	him	through	a	 transl 	 ator 	 	in	kind	of	a	half	whisper	.
And	he	 stop 	 ped 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
And	 amaz 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	the	 ge 	 ese 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	on	the	other	side	of	the	 pad 	 dock 	 	when	I	was	around	--	``	Get	the	hell	away	from	 th 	 is 	 	kid	!	''	--	when	I	 lower 	 ed 	 	my	voice	,	they	all	came	right	up	to	us	.
Right	up	to	us	,	like	right	up	to	here	.
Right	 a 	 long 	 	the	 f 	 ence 	 	line	.
And	 f 	 ence 	 	line	was	 amaz 	 ing 	 	in	 it 	 self 	 	.
The	 f 	 ence 	 	--	like	 th 	 is 	 	conception	of	 f 	 ence 	 	that	we	have	it	's	 total 	 ly 	 	 back 	 ward 	 	with	him	.
The	 electric 	 ity 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	 fiber 	 glass 	 	 f 	 ence 	 	is	 on 	 ly 	 	on	the	 out 	 side 	 	.
He	 re 	 wired 	 	it	.	He	 invent 	 ed 	 	it	.
I	've	never	 s 	 een 	 	it	.	 Hav 	 e 	 	you	?
You	 f 	 ence 	 	in	 animal 	 s 	 	.	You	 electr 	 ify 	 	the	 in 	 side 	 	.
He	 do 	 es 	 	n't	.
He	 electr 	 ifies 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	the	 out 	 side 	 	.
Why	?
 Be 	 cause 	 	he	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	that	he	felt	like	the	 ge 	 ese 	 	--	and	he	 prov 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	not	just	a	 conce 	 it 	 	,	he	 prov 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	--	the	 ge 	 ese 	 	felt	 manipul 	 ated 	 	when	they	 we 	 re 	 	 imprison 	 ed 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	little	 pad 	 dock 	 s 	 	.
Even	 th 	 ough 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 imprison 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	Garden	of	 E 	 den 	 	with	 fig 	 s 	 	and	 every 	 thing 	 	else	.
He	felt	like	they	felt	 manipul 	 ated 	 	.
So	he	got	rid	of	the	 electric 	 ity 	 	,	he	got	rid	of	current	on	the	 in 	 side 	 	and	 ke 	 pt 	 	it	on	the	 out 	 side 	 	,	so	it	would	protect	them	against	 coyote 	 s 	 	and	other	 predator 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	?
 The 	 y 	 	ate	,	and	he	 show 	 ed 	 	me	on	a	chart	,	how	they	ate	about	20	percent	more	feed	to	feed	 the 	 ir 	 	 liver 	 s 	 	.
The	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	is	 in 	 credible 	 	.
I	mean	,	his	farm	is	 in 	 credible 	 	.
It	 re 	 ally 	 	is	the	Garden	of	 E 	 den 	 	.
There	's	 fig 	 s 	 	and	 every 	 thing 	 	else	there	for	the	taking	.
And	the	 iron 	 y 	 	of	 iron 	 ies 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	 Ex 	 trem 	 ad 	 ura 	 	,	the	area	--	what	 do 	 es 	 	 Ex 	 trem 	 ad 	 ura 	 	mean	?
Extra	hard	land	,	right	?
Extra	difficult	.	Extra	hard	.
But	over	four	 generation 	 s 	 	,	he	and	his	family	have	 liter 	 ally 	 	 transform 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	extra	hard	land	 in 	 to 	 	a	tasting	menu	.
 Up 	 grade 	 s 	 	the	life	for	these	 ge 	 ese 	 	.
And	they	are	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	take	 what 	 ever 	 	they	want	.
 An 	 other 	 	 iron 	 y 	 	,	the	double	 iron 	 y 	 	is	that	on	the	 fig 	 s 	 	and	the	 o 	 live 	 s 	 	,	Eduardo	can	make	more	money	selling	 t 	 hose 	 	than	he	can	on	the	 fo 	 ie 	 	 gra 	 s 	 	.
He	 do 	 es 	 	n't	care	.
He	lets	them	take	what	they	want	and	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 Us 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	about	50	percent	.	 The 	 y 	 	're	 ver 	 y 	 	fair	.	''
The	other	50	percent	,	he	 take 	 s 	 	and	he	 sell 	 s 	 	and	he	 make 	 s 	 	money	on	them	.
Part	of	the	income	for	his	farm	.
A	big	part	of	his	income	for	his	farm	.
But	he	never	 control 	 s 	 	it	.
 The 	 y 	 	get	what	they	want	,	they	 leav 	 e 	 	the	rest	for	me	and	I	sell	it	.
 Hi 	 s 	 	 big 	 gest 	 	obstacle	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	was	the	 market 	 place 	 	,	which	 demand 	 s 	 	these	 day 	 s 	 	bright	yellow	 fo 	 ie 	 	 gra 	 s 	 	.
That	's	how	I	've	 be 	 en 	 	trained	.
You	want	to	look	and	see	what	good	 fo 	 ie 	 	 gra 	 s 	 	is	,	it	's	got	to	be	bright	yellow	.
It	's	the	 indic 	 ation 	 	that	it	's	the	best	 fo 	 ie 	 	 gra 	 s 	 	.
Well	,	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	force	feed	,	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 ga 	 vage 	 	 ton 	 s 	 	of	corn	,	his	 liver 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	 gr 	 ey 	 	.
Or	they	 we 	 re 	 	.
But	he	found	 th 	 is 	 	wild	plant	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 Lu 	 pin 	 	bush	.
The	 Lu 	 pin 	 	bush	,	it	's	all	around	 Ex 	 trem 	 ad 	 ura 	 	.
He	let	it	go	to	seed	,	he	took	the	 seed 	 s 	 	,	he	 plant 	 ed 	 	it	on	his	30	 acre 	 s 	 	,	all	around	.
And	the	 ge 	 ese 	 	love	the	 Lu 	 pin 	 	bush	.
Not	for	the	bush	,	but	for	the	 seed 	 s 	 	.
And	when	they	eat	the	 seed 	 s 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 fo 	 ie 	 	 gra 	 s 	 	 turn 	 s 	 	yellow	.
 Radio 	 active 	 	yellow	.
 B 	 right 	 	yellow	.
Of	the	highest	quality	 fo 	 ie 	 	 gra 	 s 	 	yellow	I	've	ever	 s 	 een 	 	.
So	I	'm	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	all	 th 	 is 	 	,	you	know	,	and	I	'm	like	,	is	 th 	 is 	 	guy	for	real	?	 I 	 s 	 	he	making	some	of	 th 	 is 	 	up	?
 I 	 s 	 	he	like	,	you	know	--	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	have	an	answer	for	 every 	 thing 	 	,	and	it	was	 al 	 ways 	 	nature	.
It	was	never	him	.
And	I	was	like	,	you	know	,	I	 al 	 ways 	 	get	a	little	,	like	,	 weird 	 ed 	 	out	by	people	who	deflect	 every 	 thing 	 	away	from	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	they	want	you	to	look	at	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	right	?
But	he	 deflect 	 ed 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	away	from	his	 ing 	 en 	 u 	 ity 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	with	his	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	.
So	it	's	like	,	here	I	am	,	I	'm	on	the	 f 	 ence 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	guy	,	but	 increasing 	 ly 	 	,	eating	up	his	every	word	.
And	we	're	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	,	and	I	hear	[	 clap 	 ping 	 	]	from	a	distance	,	so	I	look	over	.
And	he	 grab 	 s 	 	my	arm	and	the	 transl 	 ator 	 	's	,	and	 duck 	 s 	 	us	under	a	bush	and	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 Wat 	 ch 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.	''
``	 S 	 hush 	 	,	''	he	 say 	 s 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	for	the	500th	time	to	me	.
``	 S 	 hush 	 	,	watch	 th 	 is 	 	.	''
And	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 quad 	 ron 	 	of	 ge 	 ese 	 	come	over	.
[	 Cl 	 app 	 ing 	 	]	And	they	're	 get 	 ting 	 	 loud 	 er 	 	,	 loud 	 er 	 	,	 loud 	 er 	 	,	like	 re 	 ally 	 	loud	,	right	over	us	.
And	like	 air 	 port 	 	traffic	control	,	 a 	 s 	 	they	start	to	go	past	us	they	're	 call 	 ed 	 	back	--	and	they	're	 call 	 ed 	 	back	and	back	and	back	.
And	then	they	circle	around	.
And	his	 ge 	 ese 	 	are	 call 	 ing 	 	up	now	to	the	wild	 ge 	 ese 	 	.
[	 Cl 	 app 	 ing 	 	]	And	the	wild	 ge 	 ese 	 	are	 call 	 ing 	 	down	.
[	 Cl 	 app 	 ing 	 	]	And	it	's	 get 	 ting 	 	 loud 	 er 	 	and	 loud 	 er 	 	and	they	circle	and	circle	and	they	land	.
And	I	'm	just	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	No	way	.	''
No	way	.
And	I	look	at	Eduardo	,	who	's	near	 tear 	 s 	 	looking	at	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	I	say	,	``	You	're	 tell 	 ing 	 	me	that	your	 ge 	 ese 	 	are	 call 	 ing 	 	to	the	wild	 ge 	 ese 	 	to	say	come	for	a	visit	?	''
And	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	No	,	no	,	no	.
 The 	 y 	 	've	come	to	stay	.	''
 The 	 y 	 	've	come	to	stay	?
It	's	like	the	DNA	of	a	goose	is	to	fly	south	in	the	winter	,	right	?
I	 s 	 aid 	 	that	.	I	 s 	 aid 	 	``	 I 	 s 	 	n't	that	what	they	're	put	on	 th 	 is 	 	Earth	for	?
To	fly	south	in	the	winter	and	north	when	it	 get 	 s 	 	warm	?	''
He	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	No	,	no	,	no	.
 T 	 heir 	 	DNA	is	to	find	the	 condition 	 s 	 	that	are	 con 	 duc 	 ive 	 	to	life	.
To	happiness	.
 The 	 y 	 	find	it	here	.
 The 	 y 	 	do	n't	need	 any 	 thing 	 	more	.	''
 The 	 y 	 	stop	.	 The 	 y 	 	mate	with	his	 domestic 	 ated 	 	 ge 	 ese 	 	,	and	his	flock	 continu 	 es 	 	.
Think	about	that	for	a	minute	.
It	's	 brilli 	 ant 	 	,	right	?
 Imagin 	 e 	 	--	I	do	n't	know	,	imagine	a	hog	farm	in	,	like	,	North	 Caro 	 lina 	 	,	and	a	wild	pig	 come 	 s 	 	 up 	 on 	 	a	 factor 	 y 	 	farm	and	 decide 	 s 	 	to	stay	.
So	how	did	it	taste	?
I	 final 	 ly 	 	got	to	taste	it	before	I	left	.
He	took	me	to	his	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	restaurant	and	he	 serv 	 ed 	 	me	some	of	his	 fo 	 ie 	 	 gra 	 s 	 	,	 con 	 fit 	 	de	 fo 	 ie 	 	 gra 	 s 	 	.
It	was	 in 	 credible 	 	.
And	the	problem	with	 say 	 ing 	 	that	,	of	course	,	is	that	you	know	,	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	it	 risk 	 s 	 	 hyper 	 bo 	 le 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 eas 	 ily 	 	.
And	I	'd	like	to	make	a	metaphor	,	but	I	do	n't	have	one	 re 	 ally 	 	.
I	was	 drink 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	guy	's	 Kool 	 - 	 Aid 	 	so	much	,	he	could	have	 serv 	 ed 	 	me	goose	 feather 	 s 	 	and	I	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	like	,	 th 	 is 	 	guy	's	a	 gen 	 ius 	 	,	you	know	?
I	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	in	love	with	him	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	.
But	it	 tru 	 ly 	 	was	the	best	 fo 	 ie 	 	 gra 	 s 	 	of	my	life	.
So	much	so	that	I	do	n't	think	I	had	ever	 re 	 ally 	 	had	 fo 	 ie 	 	 gra 	 s 	 	 un 	 til 	 	that	moment	.
I	'd	had	 some 	 thing 	 	that	was	 call 	 ed 	 	 fo 	 ie 	 	 gra 	 s 	 	.
But	 th 	 is 	 	was	 transform 	 ative 	 	.	 Re 	 ally 	 	 transform 	 ative 	 	.
And	I	say	to	you	,	I	might	not	stick	to	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	I	do	n't	think	I	'll	ever	serve	 fo 	 ie 	 	 gra 	 s 	 	on	my	menu	 aga 	 in 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	that	taste	experience	with	Eduardo	.
It	was	sweet	,	it	was	 un 	 ctu 	 ous 	 	.
It	had	all	the	 qual 	 ities 	 	of	 fo 	 ie 	 	 gra 	 s 	 	,	but	 it 	 s 	 	fat	had	a	lot	of	 integ 	 r 	 ity 	 	and	a	lot	of	 honest 	 y 	 	.
And	you	could	taste	 herb 	 s 	 	,	you	could	taste	 spice 	 s 	 	.
And	I	 ke 	 pt 	 	--	I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	you	know	,	I	 s 	 wear 	 	to	God	I	 taste 	 d 	 	star	 an 	 ise 	 	.
I	was	 s 	 ure 	 	of	it	.
And	I	'm	not	like	some	super	 ta 	 ster 	 	,	you	know	?
But	I	can	taste	 thing 	 s 	 	.
There	's	100	percent	star	 an 	 ise 	 	in	there	.
And	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	No	.	''
And	I	 end 	 ed 	 	up	like	going	down	the	 spice 	 s 	 	,	and	 final 	 ly 	 	,	it	was	like	,	 O 	 K 	 	,	salt	and	pepper	,	 think 	 ing 	 	he	's	 salt 	 ed 	 	and	 pepper 	 ed 	 	his	liver	.
But	no	.
He	 take 	 s 	 	the	liver	when	he	 harvest 	 s 	 	the	 fo 	 ie 	 	 gra 	 s 	 	,	he	 stick 	 s 	 	them	in	 th 	 is 	 	jar	and	he	 con 	 fit 	 s 	 	it	.
No	salt	,	no	pepper	,	no	oil	,	no	 spice 	 s 	 	.
What	?
We	went	back	out	for	the	final	tour	of	the	farm	,	and	he	 show 	 ed 	 	me	the	wild	pepper	 plant 	 s 	 	and	the	 plant 	 s 	 	that	he	made	 s 	 ure 	 	 exist 	 ed 	 	on	his	farm	for	 s 	 al 	 in 	 ity 	 	.
He	 do 	 es 	 	n't	need	salt	and	pepper	.
And	he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	need	 spice 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	he	's	got	 th 	 is 	 	 pot 	 pour 	 ri 	 	of	 herb 	 s 	 	and	 flavor 	 s 	 	that	his	 ge 	 ese 	 	love	to	gorge	on	.
I	 turn 	 ed 	 	to	him	at	the	end	of	the	meal	,	and	it	's	a	question	I	 ask 	 ed 	 	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 time 	 s 	 	,	and	he	had	n't	,	kind	of	,	 answer 	 ed 	 	me	 direct 	 ly 	 	,	but	I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 N 	 ow 	 	look	,	you	're	in	 Spa 	 in 	 	,	some	of	the	 great 	 est 	 	 chef 	 s 	 	in	the	world	are	--	 Fer 	 ran 	 	Adria	,	the	 pre 	 eminent 	 	chef	of	the	world	 to 	 day 	 	,	not	that	far	from	you	.
How	come	you	do	n't	give	him	 th 	 is 	 	?
How	come	no	one	's	 re 	 ally 	 	heard	of	you	?	''
And	it	may	be	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	wine	,	or	it	may	be	 be 	 cause 	 	of	my	 excit 	 ement 	 	,	he	 answer 	 ed 	 	me	 direct 	 ly 	 	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 Be 	 cause 	 	 chef 	 s 	 	do	n't	deserve	my	 fo 	 ie 	 	 gra 	 s 	 	.	''
And	he	was	right	.
He	was	right	.
 Che 	 f 	 s 	 	take	 fo 	 ie 	 	 gra 	 s 	 	and	they	make	it	 the 	 ir 	 	own	.
 The 	 y 	 	create	a	dish	where	all	the	 vector 	 s 	 	point	at	us	.
With	Eduardo	it	's	about	the	 express 	 ion 	 	of	nature	.
And	 a 	 s 	 	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	I	think	 fitting 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	a	gift	from	God	,	with	God	 say 	 ing 	 	,	you	've	 d 	 one 	 	good	work	.
 Sim 	 ple 	 	.
I	flew	home	,	I	'm	on	the	flight	with	my	little	black	book	and	I	took	,	you	know	,	 page 	 s 	 	and	 page 	 s 	 	of	 note 	 s 	 	about	it	.
I	 re 	 ally 	 	was	 move 	 d 	 	.
And	in	the	corner	of	one	of	these	--	one	of	my	 note 	 s 	 	,	is	 th 	 is 	 	note	that	 say 	 s 	 	,	when	 ask 	 ed 	 	,	what	do	you	think	of	 convention 	 al 	 	 fo 	 ie 	 	 gra 	 s 	 	?
What	do	you	think	of	 fo 	 ie 	 	 gra 	 s 	 	that	99.99999	percent	of	the	world	eats	?
He	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	I	think	it	's	an	insult	to	 histo 	 ry 	 	.	''
And	I	wrote	,	insult	to	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
I	'm	on	the	plane	and	I	'm	just	 tear 	 ing 	 	my	hair	out	.
It	's	like	,	why	did	n't	I	follow	up	on	that	?
What	the	hell	 do 	 es 	 	that	mean	?
 Insul 	 t 	 	to	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
So	I	did	some	research	when	I	got	back	,	and	here	's	what	I	found	.
The	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 fo 	 ie 	 	 gra 	 s 	 	.
 Jew 	 s 	 	 invent 	 ed 	 	 fo 	 ie 	 	 gra 	 s 	 	.
 Tru 	 e 	 	story	.
 Tru 	 e 	 	story	.
By	accident	.
 The 	 y 	 	 we 	 re 	 	looking	for	an	 alter 	 native 	 	to	schmaltz	.
 Got 	 ten 	 	sick	of	the	chicken	fat	.
 The 	 y 	 	 we 	 re 	 	looking	for	an	 alter 	 native 	 	.
And	they	saw	in	the	fall	that	there	was	 th 	 is 	 	natural	,	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	sweet	,	 delic 	 ious 	 	fat	from	 ge 	 ese 	 	.
And	they	 s 	 laughter 	 ed 	 	them	,	used	the	fat	 through 	 out 	 	the	winter	for	 cook 	 ing 	 	.
The	Pharaoh	got	wind	of	 th 	 is 	 	--	 Th 	 is 	 	is	true	,	right	off	the	Internet	.
The	Pharaoh	got	--	I	 s 	 wear 	 	to	God	.
The	Pharaoh	got	wind	of	 th 	 is 	 	and	 want 	 ed 	 	to	taste	it	.
He	 taste 	 d 	 	it	and	fell	in	love	with	it	.
He	 start 	 ed 	 	 demand 	 ing 	 	it	.
And	he	did	n't	want	it	just	in	the	fall	,	he	 want 	 ed 	 	it	all	year	round	.
And	he	 demand 	 ed 	 	that	the	 Jew 	 s 	 	supply	 en 	 ough 	 	for	 every 	 one 	 	.
And	the	 Jew 	 s 	 	,	 fear 	 ing 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	life	,	had	to	come	up	with	an	 ing 	 en 	 ious 	 	idea	,	or	at	 l 	 east 	 	try	and	satisfy	the	Pharaoh	's	 wish 	 es 	 	,	of	course	.
And	they	 invent 	 ed 	 	,	what	?	 Ga 	 vage 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	 invent 	 ed 	 	 ga 	 vage 	 	in	a	great	moment	of	fear	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 provide 	 d 	 	the	Pharaoh	with	 ga 	 vage 	 	liver	,	and	the	good	stuff	they	 ke 	 pt 	 	for	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
 Sup 	 posed 	 ly 	 	,	 any 	 way 	 	.	I	 believ 	 e 	 	that	one	.
That	's	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 fo 	 ie 	 	 gra 	 s 	 	.
And	if	you	think	about	it	,	it	's	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	industrial	 agricultur 	 e 	 	.
It	's	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	what	we	eat	 to 	 day 	 	.
 Mo 	 st 	 	of	what	we	eat	 to 	 day 	 	.
 Mega 	 - 	 farm 	 s 	 	,	feed	 lot 	 s 	 	,	chemical	 amend 	 ments 	 	,	 long 	 - 	 distance 	 	travel	,	food	 process 	 ing 	 	.
All	of	it	,	our	food	system	.
That	's	 al 	 so 	 	an	insult	to	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
It	's	an	insult	to	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	 law 	 s 	 	of	nature	and	of	biology	.
 W 	 he 	 ther 	 	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	beef	cattle	or	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 chicken 	 s 	 	,	or	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 broc 	 coli 	 	or	Brussels	 sprout 	 s 	 	,	or	in	the	case	of	 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	's	New	York	 Time 	 s 	 	,	 cat 	 fish 	 	--	which	 whole 	 sale 	 	are	going	out	of	business	.
 What 	 ever 	 	it	is	,	it	's	a	 mind 	 set 	 	that	is	 re 	 mini 	 s 	 cent 	 	of	 Gene 	 ral 	 	 Motor 	 s 	 	.
It	's	 root 	 ed 	 	in	 extra 	 ction 	 	.
Take	more	,	sell	more	,	waste	more	.
And	for	the	future	it	wo	n't	serve	us	.
 Jon 	 a 	 s 	 	 Sal 	 k 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	great	quote	.
He	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	If	all	the	 insect 	 s 	 	 disappear 	 ed 	 	,	life	on	Earth	 a 	 s 	 	we	know	it	would	disappear	 with 	 in 	 	50	 year 	 s 	 	.
If	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	 disappear 	 ed 	 	,	life	on	Earth	 a 	 s 	 	we	know	it	would	flourish	.	''
And	he	's	right	.
We	need	now	to	adopt	a	new	conception	of	 agricultur 	 e 	 	.
 Re 	 ally 	 	new	.
One	in	which	we	stop	 treat 	 ing 	 	the	planet	 a 	 s 	 	if	it	 we 	 re 	 	some	kind	of	business	in	 liquid 	 ation 	 	.
And	stop	 de 	 grad 	 ing 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	under	the	guise	of	cheap	food	.
We	can	start	by	looking	to	 farm 	 ers 	 	like	Eduardo	.
 Farm 	 ers 	 	that	 re 	 ly 	 	on	nature	for	 solution 	 s 	 	,	for	 answer 	 s 	 	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 im 	 posing 	 	 solution 	 s 	 	on	nature	.
 Listen 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 Jan 	 ine 	 	 Ben 	 y 	 us 	 	,	one	of	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 writer 	 s 	 	and	 think 	 ers 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	 top 	 ic 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 Listen 	 ing 	 	to	nature	's	 oper 	 ating 	 	 instruct 	 ions 	 	.	''
That	's	what	Eduardo	 do 	 es 	 	,	and	 do 	 es 	 	so	 brilli 	 ant 	 ly 	 	.
And	what	he	 show 	 ed 	 	me	and	what	he	can	show	all	of	us	,	I	think	,	is	that	the	great	thing	for	 chef 	 s 	 	,	the	great	 bless 	 ing 	 	for	 chef 	 s 	 	,	and	for	people	that	care	about	food	and	 cook 	 ing 	 	,	is	that	the	most	 eco 	 logical 	 	choice	for	food	is	 al 	 so 	 	the	most	 ethic 	 al 	 	choice	for	food	.
 W 	 he 	 ther 	 	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	Brussels	 sprout 	 s 	 	or	 fo 	 ie 	 	 gra 	 s 	 	.
And	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 al 	 most 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	,	and	I	have	n't	found	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	 other 	 wise 	 	,	but	 al 	 most 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	,	the	most	 delic 	 ious 	 	choice	.
That	's	serendipitous	.
Thank	you	.
You	will	understand	 noth 	 ing 	 	with	my	type	of	English	.
It	's	good	for	you	 be 	 cause 	 	you	can	have	a	break	after	all	these	fantastic	people	.
I	must	tell	you	I	am	like	that	,	not	 ver 	 y 	 	 comfort 	 able 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 usual 	 ly 	 	,	in	life	,	I	think	my	job	is	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 use 	 less 	 	.
I	mean	,	I	feel	 use 	 less 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	after	 Caro 	 lyn 	 	,	and	all	the	other	 guy 	 s 	 	,	I	feel	like	shit	.
And	 definitive 	 ly 	 	,	I	do	n't	know	why	I	am	here	,	but	--	you	know	the	nightmare	you	can	have	,	like	you	are	an	 im 	 post 	 or 	 	,	you	 arriv 	 e 	 	at	the	opera	,	and	they	push	you	,	``	You	must	 s 	 ing 	 	!	''
I	do	n't	know	.
So	,	so	,	 be 	 cause 	 	I	have	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	show	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	say	,	we	 s 	 hall 	 	try	to	speak	about	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
We	can	start	,	if	you	want	,	by	 understand 	 ing 	 	--	it	's	just	to	start	,	it	's	not	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	but	--	how	I	work	.
When	 some 	 body 	 	 come 	 s 	 	to	me	and	ask	for	what	I	am	known	,	I	mean	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	lemon	 squeez 	 er 	 	,	toilet	brush	,	 tooth 	 pick 	 	,	 beaut 	 iful 	 	toilet	 seat 	 s 	 	,	and	why	not	--	a	 tooth 	 brush 	 	?
I	do	n't	try	to	design	the	 tooth 	 brush 	 	.
I	do	n't	try	to	say	,	``	Oh	,	that	will	be	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	object	,	''	or	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	.
That	 do 	 es 	 	n't	interest	me	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	there	is	different	 type 	 s 	 	of	design	.
The	one	,	we	can	call	it	the	 cynic 	 al 	 	design	,	that	 mean 	 s 	 	the	design	 invent 	 ed 	 	by	 Ray 	 mond 	 	 Lo 	 ewy 	 	in	the	'50s	,	who	 s 	 aid 	 	,	what	is	 ug 	 ly 	 	is	a	bad	sale	,	la	 laid 	 eur 	 	 s 	 e 	 	vend	mal	,	which	is	 terr 	 ible 	 	.
It	 mean 	 s 	 	the	design	must	be	just	the	weapon	for	 market 	 ing 	 	,	for	 produce 	 r 	 	to	make	product	more	sexy	,	like	that	,	they	sell	more	:	it	's	shit	,	it	's	 obsolet 	 e 	 	,	it	's	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	.
I	call	that	the	 cynic 	 al 	 	design	.
After	,	there	is	the	 narcissist 	 ic 	 	design	:	it	's	a	fantastic	 design 	 er 	 	who	 design 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	for	other	fantastic	 design 	 ers 	 	.
After	,	there	is	people	like	me	,	who	try	to	deserve	to	exist	,	and	who	are	so	 a 	 shame 	 d 	 	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	 use 	 less 	 	job	,	who	try	to	do	it	in	 an 	 other 	 	way	,	and	they	try	,	I	try	,	to	not	make	the	object	for	the	object	but	for	the	result	,	for	the	profit	for	the	human	 be 	 ing 	 	,	the	person	who	will	use	it	.
If	we	take	the	 tooth 	 brush 	 	--	I	do	n't	think	about	the	 tooth 	 brush 	 	.
I	think	,	``	What	will	be	the	effect	of	the	brush	in	the	mouth	?	''
And	to	understand	what	will	be	the	effect	of	the	 tooth 	 brush 	 	in	the	mouth	,	I	must	imagine	:	Who	 own 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	mouth	?
What	is	the	life	of	the	owner	of	 th 	 is 	 	mouth	?	In	what	 socie 	 ty 	 	[	 do 	 es 	 	]	 th 	 is 	 	guy	live	?
What	 civil 	 ization 	 	 create 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	?
What	animal	species	 create 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 civil 	 ization 	 	?
When	I	 arriv 	 e 	 	--	and	I	take	one	minute	,	I	am	not	so	intelligent	--	when	I	 arriv 	 e 	 	at	the	level	of	animal	species	,	that	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	real	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
Me	,	I	have	 strict 	 ly 	 	no	power	to	change	 any 	 thing 	 	.
But	when	I	come	back	,	I	can	understand	why	I	 s 	 hall 	 	not	do	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 to 	 day 	 	to	not	do	it	,	it	's	more	positive	than	do	it	,	or	how	I	 s 	 hall 	 	do	it	.
But	to	come	back	,	where	I	am	at	the	animal	species	,	there	is	 thing 	 s 	 	to	see	.
There	is	 thing 	 s 	 	to	see	,	there	is	the	big	 challeng 	 e 	 	.
The	big	 challeng 	 e 	 	in	front	of	us	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	there	is	not	a	human	production	which	 exist 	 s 	 	 out 	 side 	 	of	what	I	call	``	the	big	image	.	''
The	big	image	is	our	story	,	our	 poet 	 ry 	 	,	our	 romantic 	 ism 	 	.
Our	 poet 	 ry 	 	is	our	mutation	,	our	life	.
We	must	remember	,	and	we	can	see	that	in	any	book	of	my	son	of	10	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	that	life	 appear 	 s 	 	four	billion	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	around	--	four	billion	point	two	?
Voice	 off 	 stage 	 	:	Four	point	five	.
Yes	,	point	five	,	 O 	 K 	 	,	 O 	 K 	 	,	 O 	 K 	 	!	I	'm	a	 design 	 er 	 	,	that	's	all	,	of	 Christ 	 ma 	 s 	 	 gift 	 s 	 	.
And	before	,	there	was	 th 	 is 	 	soup	,	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 soup 	 e 	 	 primordial 	 e 	 	,	''	 th 	 is 	 	first	soup	--	bloop	bloop	bloop	--	sort	of	 dirt 	 y 	 	mud	,	no	life	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
So	then	--	 pshoo 	 - 	 s 	 hoo 	 	--	 light 	 ning 	 	--	pshoo	--	 arriv 	 e 	 	--	 pshoo 	 - 	 s 	 hoo 	 	--	 make 	 s 	 	life	--	bloop	bloop	--	and	that	dies	.
Some	million	 year 	 s 	 	after	--	 pshoo 	 - 	 s 	 hoo 	 	,	 bloop 	 - 	 bloop 	 	--	ah	,	wake	up	!
At	the	end	,	 final 	 ly 	 	,	that	 succeed 	 s 	 	,	and	life	 appear 	 s 	 	.
We	was	so	,	so	stupid	.	The	most	stupid	bacteria	.
Even	,	I	think	,	we	copy	our	way	to	 re 	 produce 	 	,	you	know	what	I	mean	,	and	 some 	 thing 	 	of	--	oh	no	,	forget	it	.
After	,	we	 be 	 come 	 	a	fish	;	after	,	we	 be 	 come 	 	a	frog	;	after	,	we	 be 	 come 	 	a	monkey	;	after	,	we	 be 	 come 	 	what	we	are	 to 	 day 	 	:	a	 super 	 - 	 monkey 	 	,	and	the	 f 	 un 	 	is	,	the	 super 	 - 	 monkey 	 	we	are	 to 	 day 	 	,	is	at	half	of	the	story	.
Can	you	imagine	?	From	that	stupid	bacteria	to	us	,	with	a	 micro 	 phone 	 	,	with	a	computer	,	with	an	iPod	:	four	billion	 year 	 s 	 	.
And	we	know	,	and	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 Caro 	 lyn 	 	 know 	 s 	 	,	that	when	the	 s 	 un 	 	will	 implod 	 e 	 	,	the	earth	will	burn	,	explode	,	I	do	n't	know	what	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 schedule 	 d 	 	for	four	,	four	billion	 year 	 s 	 	?
Yes	,	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	.	 O 	 K 	 	,	that	 mean 	 s 	 	we	are	at	half	of	the	story	.
 Fanta 	 s 	 tic 	 	!	It	's	a	 beaut 	 y 	 	!
Can	you	imagine	?	It	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 symbol 	 ic 	 	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	the	bacteria	we	was	had	no	idea	of	what	we	are	 to 	 day 	 	.
And	 to 	 day 	 	,	we	have	no	idea	of	what	we	 s 	 hall 	 	be	in	four	billion	 year 	 s 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	 territ 	 ory 	 	is	fantastic	.
That	is	our	 poet 	 ry 	 	.	That	is	our	 beaut 	 iful 	 	story	.
It	's	our	 romantic 	 ism 	 	.	 Mu 	 - 	 ta 	 - 	 tion 	 	.	We	are	 mut 	 ants 	 	.
And	if	we	do	n't	 deep 	 ly 	 	understand	,	if	we	do	n't	integrate	that	we	are	 mut 	 ants 	 	,	we	 complete 	 ly 	 	 mis 	 s 	 	the	story	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	every	generation	 think 	 s 	 	we	are	the	final	one	.
We	have	a	way	to	look	at	Earth	like	that	,	you	know	,	``	I	am	the	man	.	The	final	man	.
You	know	,	we	 mut 	 ate 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	four	billion	 year 	 s 	 	before	,	but	now	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	me	,	we	stop	.	Fin	.
For	the	end	,	for	the	 et 	 ern 	 ity 	 	,	it	is	one	with	a	red	jacket	.	''
 Some 	 thing 	 	like	that	.	I	am	not	 s 	 ure 	 	of	that	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	that	is	our	 intellig 	 ence 	 	of	mutation	and	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	.
There	is	so	 man 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	to	do	;	it	's	so	fresh	.
And	here	is	 some 	 thing 	 	:	 no 	 body 	 	is	 oblig 	 ed 	 	to	be	a	 gen 	 ius 	 	,	but	 every 	 body 	 	is	 oblig 	 ed 	 	to	 particip 	 ate 	 	.
And	to	 particip 	 ate 	 	,	for	a	 mut 	 ant 	 	,	there	is	a	 minim 	 um 	 	of	 exercis 	 e 	 	,	a	 minim 	 um 	 	of	 s 	 port 	 	.
We	can	say	that	.
The	first	,	if	you	want	--	there	is	so	 man 	 y 	 	--	but	one	which	is	 ver 	 y 	 	easy	to	do	,	is	the	duty	of	vision	.
I	can	explain	you	.	I	 s 	 hall 	 	try	.
If	you	walk	like	that	,	it	's	 O 	 K 	 	,	it	's	 O 	 K 	 	,	you	can	walk	,	but	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	walk	with	the	 eye 	 s 	 	like	that	,	you	will	not	see	,	oh	,	there	is	a	hole	.
And	you	will	fall	,	and	you	will	die	.	 D 	 anger 	 ous 	 	.
That	's	why	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	,	you	will	try	to	have	 th 	 is 	 	angle	of	vision	.
 O 	 K 	 	,	I	can	see	,	if	I	found	 some 	 thing 	 	,	up	,	up	,	and	they	 continu 	 e 	 	,	up	up	up	.
I	raise	the	angle	of	vision	,	but	it	's	still	 ver 	 y 	 	--	 self 	 ish 	 	,	 self 	 ish 	 	,	egoiste	--	 y 	 es 	 	,	 self 	 ish 	 	.
You	,	you	 surviv 	 e 	 	.	It	's	 O 	 K 	 	.
If	you	raise	the	level	of	your	 eye 	 s 	 	a	little	more	you	go	,	``	I	see	you	,	oh	my	God	you	are	here	,	how	are	you	,	I	can	help	you	,	I	can	design	for	you	a	new	 tooth 	 brush 	 	,	new	toilet	brush	,	''	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	.
I	live	in	 socie 	 ty 	 	;	I	live	in	community	.
It	's	 O 	 K. 	 	You	start	to	be	in	the	 territ 	 ory 	 	of	 intellig 	 ence 	 	,	we	can	say	.
From	 th 	 is 	 	level	,	the	more	you	can	raise	 th 	 is 	 	angle	of	view	,	the	more	you	will	be	 import 	 ant 	 	for	the	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
The	more	you	will	rise	,	the	more	you	will	be	 import 	 ant 	 	for	the	 civil 	 ization 	 	.
The	more	you	will	rise	,	to	see	far	and	high	,	like	that	,	the	more	you	will	be	 import 	 ant 	 	for	the	story	of	our	mutation	.
That	 mean 	 s 	 	intelligent	people	are	in	 th 	 is 	 	angle	.	That	is	 intellig 	 ence 	 	.
From	 th 	 is 	 	to	here	,	that	,	it	's	 gen 	 ius 	 	.
Ptolemy	,	 Era 	 to 	 sthenes 	 	,	Einstein	,	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	.
 No 	 body 	 	's	 oblig 	 ed 	 	to	be	a	 gen 	 ius 	 	.
It	's	better	,	but	 no 	 body 	 	.
Take	care	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	training	,	to	be	a	good	 mut 	 ant 	 	.
There	is	some	danger	,	there	is	some	trap	.	One	trap	:	the	 vert 	 ical 	 	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	at	the	 vert 	 ical 	 	of	us	,	if	you	look	like	that	,	``	Ah	!	my	God	,	there	is	God	.	Ah	!	God	!	''
God	is	a	trap	.	God	is	the	answer	when	we	do	n't	know	the	answer	.
That	 mean 	 s 	 	,	when	your	brain	is	not	 en 	 ough 	 	big	,	when	you	do	n't	understand	,	you	go	,	``	Ah	,	it	's	God	,	it	's	God	.	''	That	's	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	.
That	's	why	--	jump	,	like	that	?	No	,	do	n't	jump	.
Come	back	.	 Be 	 cause 	 	,	after	,	there	is	 an 	 other 	 	trap	.
If	you	look	like	that	,	you	look	to	the	past	,	or	you	look	 in 	 side 	 	if	you	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 flex 	 ible 	 	,	 in 	 side 	 	 your 	 self 	 	.
It	's	 call 	 ed 	 	 schizo 	 phrenia 	 	,	and	you	are	dead	 al 	 so 	 	.
That	's	why	every	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	now	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	are	a	good	 mut 	 ant 	 	,	you	will	raise	your	angle	of	view	.
Out	,	more	of	the	 horizon 	 tal 	 	.	You	are	an	 intellig 	 ence 	 	.
Never	forget	--	like	that	,	like	that	.
It	's	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
What	,	what	else	we	can	say	about	that	?	Why	do	that	?
It	's	 be 	 cause 	 	we	--	if	we	look	from	far	,	we	see	our	line	of	evolution	.
 Th 	 is 	 	line	of	evolution	is	 clear 	 ly 	 	positive	.
From	far	,	 th 	 is 	 	line	 look 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	smooth	,	like	that	.
But	if	you	take	a	lens	,	like	that	,	 th 	 is 	 	line	is	ack	,	ack	,	ack	,	ack	,	ack	.	Like	that	.
It	's	made	of	light	and	shadow	.
We	can	say	light	is	 civil 	 ization 	 	,	shadow	is	 barb 	 aria 	 	.
And	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	know	where	we	are	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	some	cycle	,	there	is	a	spot	in	the	cycle	,	and	you	have	not	the	same	duty	in	the	different	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	cycle	.
That	 mean 	 s 	 	,	we	can	imagine	--	I	do	n't	say	it	was	fantastic	,	but	in	the	'80s	,	there	was	not	too	much	war	,	like	that	,	it	was	--	we	can	imagine	that	the	 civil 	 ization 	 	can	 be 	 come 	 	 civil 	 ized 	 	.
In	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	people	like	me	are	 accept 	 able 	 	.
We	can	say	,	``	It	's	 luxur 	 ious 	 	time	.	''
We	have	time	to	think	,	we	have	time	to	I	do	n't	know	what	,	speak	about	art	and	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	.
It	's	 O 	 K. 	 	We	are	in	the	light	.
But	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	like	 to 	 day 	 	,	we	fall	,	we	fall	so	fast	,	so	fast	to	shadow	,	we	fall	so	fast	to	 barb 	 aria 	 	.
With	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	face	of	 barb 	 aria 	 	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	it	's	not	,	the	 barb 	 aria 	 	we	have	 to 	 day 	 	,	it	's	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	not	the	 barb 	 aria 	 	we	think	.
There	is	different	type	of	 barb 	 aria 	 	.
That	's	why	we	must	adapt	.
That	 mean 	 s 	 	,	when	 barb 	 aria 	 	is	back	,	forget	the	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 chair 	 s 	 	,	forget	the	 beaut 	 iful 	 	hotel	,	forget	design	,	even	--	I	'm	sorry	to	say	--	forget	art	.
Forget	all	that	.	There	is	 prior 	 ity 	 	;	there	is	 urge 	 ncy 	 	.
You	must	go	back	to	 politic 	 s 	 	,	you	must	go	back	to	 radical 	 ization 	 	,	I	'm	sorry	if	that	's	not	 ver 	 y 	 	English	.
You	must	go	back	to	fight	,	to	battle	.
That	's	why	 to 	 day 	 	I	'm	so	 a 	 shame 	 d 	 	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	job	.
That	's	why	I	am	here	,	to	try	to	do	it	the	best	possible	.
But	I	know	that	even	I	do	it	the	best	possible	--	that	's	why	I	'm	the	best	--	it	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	it	's	not	the	right	time	.
That	's	why	I	say	that	.	I	say	that	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	I	repeat	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	exist	if	it	's	not	in	the	good	reason	,	the	reason	of	our	 beaut 	 iful 	 	dream	,	of	 th 	 is 	 	 civil 	 ization 	 	.
And	 be 	 cause 	 	we	must	all	work	to	finish	 th 	 is 	 	story	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	the	scenario	of	 th 	 is 	 	 civil 	 ization 	 	--	about	love	,	progress	,	and	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	--	it	's	 O 	 K 	 	,	but	there	is	so	 man 	 y 	 	different	,	other	 scenario 	 s 	 	of	other	 civil 	 ization 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	scenario	,	of	 th 	 is 	 	 civil 	 ization 	 	,	was	about	 be 	 coming 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	,	intelligent	,	like	 th 	 is 	 	idea	we	have	 invent 	 ed 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 cept 	 	of	God	.
We	are	God	now	.	We	are	.	It	's	 al 	 most 	 	 d 	 one 	 	.
We	have	just	to	finish	the	story	.
That	is	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
And	when	you	do	n't	understand	 re 	 ally 	 	what	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	you	can	not	go	and	fight	and	work	and	build	and	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	.
You	go	to	the	future	back	,	back	,	back	,	back	,	like	that	.
And	you	can	fall	,	and	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	.
No	,	you	must	 re 	 ally 	 	understand	that	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	we	have	 al 	 most 	 	 finish 	 ed 	 	,	I	'll	repeat	 th 	 is 	 	story	.
And	the	 beaut 	 y 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	in	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	50	 year 	 s 	 	,	60	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	can	finish	 complete 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 civil 	 ization 	 	,	and	 off 	 er 	 	to	our	children	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	to	invent	a	new	story	,	a	new	 poet 	 ry 	 	,	a	new	 romantic 	 ism 	 	.
With	 billion 	 s 	 	of	people	who	have	 be 	 en 	 	born	,	 work 	 ed 	 	,	lived	and	 di 	 ed 	 	before	us	,	these	people	who	have	 work 	 ed 	 	so	much	,	we	have	now	 br 	 ing 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 gift 	 s 	 	,	we	know	so	 man 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
We	can	say	to	our	children	,	 O 	 K 	 	,	 d 	 one 	 	,	that	was	our	story	.	That	 pass 	 ed 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	you	have	a	duty	:	invent	a	new	story	.	Invent	a	new	 poet 	 ry 	 	.
The	 on 	 ly 	 	rule	is	,	we	have	not	to	have	any	idea	about	the	next	story	.
We	give	you	white	 page 	 s 	 	.	Invent	.
We	give	you	the	best	 tool 	 s 	 	,	the	best	 tool 	 s 	 	,	and	now	,	do	it	.
That	's	why	I	 continu 	 e 	 	to	work	,	even	if	it	's	for	toilet	brush	.
I	want	you	to	take	a	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	baby	.
What	you	're	drawn	to	are	her	 eye 	 s 	 	and	the	skin	you	love	to	touch	.
But	 to 	 day 	 	I	'm	going	to	talk	to	you	about	 some 	 thing 	 	you	ca	n't	see	--	what	's	going	on	up	in	that	little	brain	of	 her 	 s 	 	.
The	modern	 tool 	 s 	 	of	 neuro 	 science 	 	are	 demonst 	 rating 	 	to	us	that	what	's	going	on	up	there	is	 noth 	 ing 	 	short	of	rocket	science	.
And	what	we	're	 learn 	 ing 	 	is	going	to	shed	some	light	on	what	the	romantic	 writer 	 s 	 	and	 poet 	 s 	 	 de 	 scribed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	``	 ce 	 les 	 tial 	 	 open 	 ness 	 	''	of	the	child	's	mind	.
What	we	see	here	is	a	mother	in	India	,	and	she	's	 s 	 peaking 	 	Koro	,	which	is	a	 new 	 ly 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	language	.
And	she	's	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	her	baby	.
What	 th 	 is 	 	mother	--	and	the	800	people	who	speak	Koro	in	the	world	--	 understand 	 s 	 	[	is	]	that	,	to	preserve	 th 	 is 	 	language	,	they	need	to	speak	it	to	the	 bab 	 ies 	 	.
And	 there 	 in 	 	lies	a	critical	 puzzl 	 e 	 	.
Why	is	it	that	you	ca	n't	preserve	a	language	by	 s 	 peaking 	 	to	you	and	I	,	to	the	 adult 	 s 	 	?
Well	,	it	's	got	to	do	with	your	brain	.
What	we	see	here	is	that	language	 ha 	 s 	 	a	critical	period	for	 learn 	 ing 	 	.
The	way	to	read	 th 	 is 	 	slide	is	to	look	at	your	age	on	the	 horizon 	 tal 	 	axis	.
And	you	'll	see	on	the	 vert 	 ical 	 	your	skill	at	 acquir 	 ing 	 	a	second	language	.
 Bab 	 ies 	 	and	children	are	 gen 	 ius 	 es 	 	 un 	 til 	 	they	turn	seven	,	and	then	there	's	a	 system 	 atic 	 	decline	.
After	puberty	,	we	fall	off	the	map	.
No	 scientist 	 s 	 	 disput 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 curv 	 e 	 	,	but	 labor 	 ator 	 ies 	 	all	over	the	world	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	why	it	 work 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
Work	in	my	lab	is	focused	on	the	first	critical	period	in	 develop 	 ment 	 	--	and	that	is	the	period	in	which	 bab 	 ies 	 	try	to	master	which	 sound 	 s 	 	are	used	in	 the 	 ir 	 	language	.
We	think	,	by	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	how	the	 sound 	 s 	 	are	 learn 	 ed 	 	,	we	'll	have	a	model	for	the	rest	of	language	,	and	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	for	critical	 period 	 s 	 	that	may	exist	in	 child 	 hood 	 	for	social	,	 emotion 	 al 	 	and	cognitive	 develop 	 ment 	 	.
So	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	the	 bab 	 ies 	 	using	a	 techni 	 que 	 	that	we	're	using	all	over	the	world	and	the	 sound 	 s 	 	of	all	 language 	 s 	 	.
The	baby	 s 	 it 	 s 	 	on	a	parent	's	lap	,	and	we	train	them	to	turn	 the 	 ir 	 	 head 	 s 	 	when	a	sound	 change 	 s 	 	--	like	from	``	ah	''	to	``	ee	.	''
If	they	do	so	at	the	appropriate	time	,	the	black	box	 light 	 s 	 	up	and	a	 pan 	 da 	 	bear	 pound 	 s 	 	a	drum	.
A	 six 	 - 	 month 	 er 	 	 ador 	 es 	 	the	task	.
What	have	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	?
Well	,	 bab 	 ies 	 	all	over	the	world	are	what	I	like	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	 a 	 s 	 	``	 citizen 	 s 	 	of	the	world	.	''
 The 	 y 	 	can	discriminate	all	the	 sound 	 s 	 	of	all	 language 	 s 	 	,	no	matter	what	country	we	're	 test 	 ing 	 	and	what	language	we	're	using	,	and	that	's	 remark 	 able 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	you	and	I	ca	n't	do	that	.
We	're	 culture 	 - 	 bound 	 	 listen 	 ers 	 	.
We	can	discriminate	the	 sound 	 s 	 	of	our	own	language	,	but	not	 t 	 hose 	 	of	foreign	 language 	 s 	 	.
So	the	question	 arise 	 s 	 	:	when	do	 t 	 hose 	 	 citizen 	 s 	 	of	the	world	turn	 in 	 to 	 	the	 language 	 - 	 bound 	 	 listen 	 ers 	 	that	we	are	?
And	the	answer	:	before	 the 	 ir 	 	first	 birth 	 day 	 s 	 	.
What	you	see	here	is	performance	on	that	 head 	 - 	 turn 	 	task	for	 bab 	 ies 	 	tested	in	 To 	 kyo 	 	and	the	 Unit 	 ed 	 	 Stat 	 es 	 	,	here	in	 Sea 	 ttle 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	they	 listen 	 ed 	 	to	``	ra	''	and	``	la	''	--	 sound 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	English	,	but	not	to	 Japan 	 ese 	 	.
So	at	six	to	eight	 month 	 s 	 	the	 bab 	 ies 	 	are	 total 	 ly 	 	 equi 	 valent 	 	.
Two	 month 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	 occur 	 s 	 	.
The	 bab 	 ies 	 	in	the	 Unit 	 ed 	 	 Stat 	 es 	 	are	 get 	 ting 	 	a	lot	better	,	 bab 	 ies 	 	in	Japan	are	 get 	 ting 	 	a	lot	 wo 	 rse 	 	,	but	both	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 group 	 s 	 	of	 bab 	 ies 	 	are	 pre 	 par 	 ing 	 	for	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	language	that	they	are	going	to	learn	.
So	the	question	is	:	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	critical	 two 	 - 	 month 	 	period	?
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	critical	period	for	sound	 develop 	 ment 	 	,	but	what	's	going	on	up	there	?
So	there	are	two	 thing 	 s 	 	going	on	.
The	first	is	that	the	 bab 	 ies 	 	are	 listen 	 ing 	 	 intent 	 ly 	 	to	us	,	and	they	're	taking	 statistic 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	listen	to	us	talk	--	they	're	taking	 statistic 	 s 	 	.
So	listen	to	two	 mother 	 s 	 	 s 	 peaking 	 	 mother 	 ese 	 	--	the	universal	language	we	use	when	we	talk	to	 kid 	 s 	 	--	first	in	English	and	then	in	 Japan 	 ese 	 	.
English	Mother	:	Ah	,	I	love	your	big	blue	 eye 	 s 	 	--	so	 pre 	 tty 	 	and	nice	.
 Japan 	 ese 	 	Mother	:	[	 Japan 	 ese 	 	]	 Pa 	 tric 	 ia 	 	Kuhl	:	 Dur 	 ing 	 	the	production	of	speech	,	when	 bab 	 ies 	 	listen	,	what	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	is	taking	 statistic 	 s 	 	on	the	language	that	they	hear	.
And	 t 	 hose 	 	 distribut 	 ions 	 	grow	.
And	what	we	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	is	that	 bab 	 ies 	 	are	sensitive	to	the	 statistic 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 statistic 	 s 	 	of	 Japan 	 ese 	 	and	English	are	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	different	.
English	 ha 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	 R 	 s 	 	and	 L 	 s 	 	.
The	 distribut 	 ion 	 	 show 	 s 	 	.
And	the	 distribut 	 ion 	 	of	 Japan 	 ese 	 	is	 total 	 ly 	 	different	,	where	we	see	a	group	of	 inter 	 mediate 	 	 sound 	 s 	 	,	which	is	known	 a 	 s 	 	the	 Japan 	 ese 	 	``	R	.	''
So	 bab 	 ies 	 	absorb	the	 statistic 	 s 	 	of	the	language	and	it	 change 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 brain 	 s 	 	;	it	 change 	 s 	 	them	from	the	 citizen 	 s 	 	of	the	world	to	the	 culture 	 - 	 bound 	 	 listen 	 ers 	 	that	we	are	.
But	we	 a 	 s 	 	 adult 	 s 	 	are	no	 long 	 er 	 	 absorb 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 statistic 	 s 	 	.
We	're	 govern 	 ed 	 	by	the	 represent 	 ations 	 	in	 memor 	 y 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 form 	 ed 	 	early	in	 develop 	 ment 	 	.
So	what	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	here	is	changing	our	 model 	 s 	 	of	what	the	critical	period	is	about	.
We	're	 argu 	 ing 	 	from	a	 mathematic 	 al 	 	 stand 	 point 	 	that	the	 learn 	 ing 	 	of	language	material	may	 s 	 low 	 	down	when	our	 distribut 	 ions 	 	 stabil 	 ize 	 	.
It	's	raising	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 question 	 s 	 	about	 bi 	 lingual 	 	people	.
 Bi 	 lingual 	 s 	 	must	keep	two	 set 	 s 	 	of	 statistic 	 s 	 	in	mind	at	once	and	flip	between	them	,	one	after	the	other	,	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	who	they	're	 s 	 peaking 	 	to	.
So	we	 ask 	 ed 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	can	the	 bab 	 ies 	 	take	 statistic 	 s 	 	on	a	brand	new	language	?
And	we	tested	 th 	 is 	 	by	 ex 	 posing 	 	American	 bab 	 ies 	 	who	'd	never	heard	a	second	language	to	 Man 	 da 	 rin 	 	for	the	first	time	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	critical	period	.
We	 k 	 new 	 	that	,	when	 mono 	 lingual 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	tested	in	 Tai 	 pe 	 i 	 	and	 Sea 	 ttle 	 	on	the	 Man 	 da 	 rin 	 	 sound 	 s 	 	,	they	 show 	 ed 	 	the	same	pattern	.
Six	to	eight	 month 	 s 	 	,	they	're	 total 	 ly 	 	 equi 	 valent 	 	.
Two	 month 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	.
But	the	 Tai 	 wan 	 ese 	 	 bab 	 ies 	 	are	 get 	 ting 	 	better	,	not	the	American	 bab 	 ies 	 	.
What	we	did	was	 ex 	 pose 	 	American	 bab 	 ies 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	period	to	 Man 	 da 	 rin 	 	.
It	was	like	 hav 	 ing 	 	 Man 	 da 	 rin 	 	 relat 	 ive 	 s 	 	come	and	visit	for	a	month	and	move	 in 	 to 	 	your	house	and	talk	to	the	 bab 	 ies 	 	for	12	 session 	 s 	 	.
 He 	 re 	 	's	what	it	 look 	 ed 	 	like	in	the	 labor 	 atory 	 	.
 Man 	 da 	 rin 	 	 Speak 	 er 	 	:	[	 Man 	 da 	 rin 	 	]	 P 	 K 	 	:	So	what	have	we	 d 	 one 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	little	 brain 	 s 	 	?
We	had	to	run	a	control	group	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	just	coming	 in 	 to 	 	the	 labor 	 atory 	 	did	n't	improve	your	 Man 	 da 	 rin 	 	 skill 	 s 	 	.
So	a	group	of	 bab 	 ies 	 	came	in	and	 listen 	 ed 	 	to	English	.
And	we	can	see	from	the	graph	that	 expo 	 s 	 ure 	 	to	English	did	n't	improve	 the 	 ir 	 	 Man 	 da 	 rin 	 	.
But	look	at	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	the	 bab 	 ies 	 	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	to	 Man 	 da 	 rin 	 	for	12	 session 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 a 	 s 	 	good	 a 	 s 	 	the	 bab 	 ies 	 	in	 Tai 	 wan 	 	who	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 listen 	 ing 	 	for	10-and-a-half	 month 	 s 	 	.
What	it	 demonst 	 rated 	 	is	that	 bab 	 ies 	 	take	 statistic 	 s 	 	on	a	new	language	.
 What 	 ever 	 	you	put	in	front	of	them	,	they	'll	take	 statistic 	 s 	 	on	.
But	we	 wonder 	 ed 	 	what	role	the	human	 be 	 ing 	 	 play 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	 exercis 	 e 	 	.
So	we	ran	 an 	 other 	 	group	of	 bab 	 ies 	 	in	which	the	 kid 	 s 	 	got	the	same	 do 	 s 	 age 	 	,	the	same	12	 session 	 s 	 	,	but	over	a	 tele 	 vision 	 	set	and	 an 	 other 	 	group	of	 bab 	 ies 	 	who	had	just	audio	 expo 	 s 	 ure 	 	and	 look 	 ed 	 	at	a	 ted 	 dy 	 	bear	on	the	screen	.
What	did	we	do	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 brain 	 s 	 	?
What	you	see	here	is	the	audio	result	--	no	 learn 	 ing 	 	 what 	 so 	 ever 	 	--	and	the	video	result	--	no	 learn 	 ing 	 	 what 	 so 	 ever 	 	.
It	 take 	 s 	 	a	human	 be 	 ing 	 	for	 bab 	 ies 	 	to	take	 the 	 ir 	 	 statistic 	 s 	 	.
The	social	brain	is	 controll 	 ing 	 	when	the	 bab 	 ies 	 	are	taking	 the 	 ir 	 	 statistic 	 s 	 	.
We	want	to	get	 in 	 side 	 	the	brain	and	see	 th 	 is 	 	thing	 happen 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 bab 	 ies 	 	are	in	front	of	 tele 	 vision 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	in	front	of	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
 Thank 	 fully 	 	,	we	have	a	new	machine	,	 magnet 	 o 	 encephalo 	 graphy 	 	,	that	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
It	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	hair	 dry 	 er 	 	from	 Mar 	 s 	 	.
But	it	's	 complete 	 ly 	 	safe	,	 complete 	 ly 	 	 non 	 - 	 invasive 	 	and	silent	.
We	're	looking	at	millimeter	 accu 	 racy 	 	with	regard	to	spatial	and	 milli 	 second 	 	 accu 	 racy 	 	using	306	 SQUID 	 s 	 	--	these	are	 Super 	 conduct 	 ing 	 	QUantum	 Inter 	 ference 	 	 De 	 vice 	 s 	 	--	to	pick	up	the	 magnet 	 ic 	 	 field 	 s 	 	that	change	 a 	 s 	 	we	do	our	 think 	 ing 	 	.
We	're	the	first	in	the	world	to	record	 bab 	 ies 	 	in	an	 ME 	 G 	 	machine	while	they	are	 learn 	 ing 	 	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	is	little	Emma	.
She	's	a	 six 	 - 	 month 	 er 	 	.
And	she	's	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	 vari 	 ous 	 	 language 	 s 	 	in	the	 ear 	 phone 	 s 	 	that	are	in	her	 ear 	 s 	 	.
You	can	see	,	she	can	move	around	.
We	're	 track 	 ing 	 	her	head	with	little	 pel 	 lets 	 	in	a	cap	,	so	she	's	free	to	move	 complete 	 ly 	 	 un 	 con 	 s 	 trained 	 	.
It	's	a	technical	tour	de	force	.
What	are	we	 see 	 ing 	 	?
We	're	 see 	 ing 	 	the	baby	brain	.
 A 	 s 	 	the	baby	 hear 	 s 	 	a	word	in	her	language	the	 audit 	 ory 	 	 area 	 s 	 	light	up	,	and	then	 sub 	 sequent 	 ly 	 	 area 	 s 	 	 surround 	 ing 	 	it	that	we	think	are	related	to	 cohere 	 nce 	 	,	 get 	 ting 	 	the	brain	 coordinate 	 d 	 	with	 it 	 s 	 	different	 area 	 s 	 	,	one	brain	area	 caus 	 ing 	 	 an 	 other 	 	to	activate	.
We	are	 embark 	 ing 	 	on	a	grand	and	 gold 	 en 	 	age	of	knowledge	about	child	's	brain	 develop 	 ment 	 	.
We	're	going	to	be	able	to	see	a	child	's	brain	 a 	 s 	 	they	experience	an	emotion	,	 a 	 s 	 	they	learn	to	speak	and	read	,	 a 	 s 	 	they	solve	a	math	problem	,	 a 	 s 	 	they	have	an	idea	.
And	we	're	going	to	be	able	to	invent	 brain 	 - 	 based 	 	 intervention 	 s 	 	for	children	who	have	 difficult 	 y 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	.
Just	 a 	 s 	 	the	 poet 	 s 	 	and	 writer 	 s 	 	 de 	 scribed 	 	,	we	're	going	to	be	able	to	see	,	I	think	,	that	 won 	 dr 	 ous 	 	 open 	 ness 	 	,	utter	and	complete	 open 	 ness 	 	,	of	the	mind	of	a	child	.
In	 invest 	 ig 	 ating 	 	the	child	's	brain	,	we	're	going	to	 un 	 cover 	 	deep	 truth 	 s 	 	about	what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	to	be	human	,	and	in	the	process	,	we	may	be	able	to	help	keep	our	own	 mind 	 s 	 	open	to	 learn 	 ing 	 	for	our	entire	 live 	 s 	 	.
Thank	you	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 R 	 evolution 	 	2.0	.
No	one	was	a	hero	.	No	one	was	a	hero	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	 every 	 one 	 	was	a	hero	.
 Every 	 one 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	.
We	all	use	Wikipedia	.
If	you	think	of	the	 con 	 cept 	 	of	Wikipedia	where	 every 	 one 	 	is	 collabor 	 ating 	 	on	content	,	and	at	the	end	of	the	day	you	've	built	the	largest	encyclopedia	in	the	world	.
From	just	an	idea	that	 sound 	 ed 	 	crazy	,	you	have	the	largest	encyclopedia	in	the	world	.
And	in	the	Egyptian	revolution	,	the	 R 	 evolution 	 	2.0	,	 every 	 one 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 con 	 tribute 	 d 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	,	small	or	big	.	 The 	 y 	 	 con 	 tribute 	 d 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	--	to	 br 	 ing 	 	us	one	of	the	most	inspiring	 st 	 ories 	 	in	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 man 	 kind 	 	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	 revolution 	 s 	 	.
It	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	inspiring	to	see	all	these	 Egyptian 	 s 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	changing	.
If	you	look	at	the	scene	,	Egypt	,	for	30	 year 	 s 	 	,	had	 be 	 en 	 	in	a	 down 	 hill 	 	--	going	 in 	 to 	 	a	 down 	 hill 	 	.
 Every 	 thing 	 	was	going	bad	.
 Every 	 thing 	 	was	going	wrong	.
We	 on 	 ly 	 	 rank 	 ed 	 	high	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	poverty	,	 corrupt 	 ion 	 	,	lack	of	 free 	 dom 	 	of	speech	,	lack	of	 politic 	 al 	 	 activ 	 ism 	 	.
 T 	 hose 	 	 we 	 re 	 	the	 achiev 	 ement 	 s 	 	of	our	great	regime	.
 Y 	 et 	 	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
And	it	's	not	 be 	 cause 	 	people	 we 	 re 	 	happy	or	people	 we 	 re 	 	not	 frust 	 rated 	 	.
In	fact	,	people	 we 	 re 	 	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 frust 	 rated 	 	.
But	the	reason	why	 every 	 one 	 	was	silent	is	what	I	call	the	 psycho 	 logical 	 	 bar 	 rier 	 	of	fear	.
 Every 	 one 	 	was	 scar 	 ed 	 	.
Not	 every 	 one 	 	.	There	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	few	brave	 Egyptian 	 s 	 	that	I	have	to	thank	for	 be 	 ing 	 	so	brave	--	going	 in 	 to 	 	 protest 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	couple	of	hundred	,	 get 	 ting 	 	 beat 	 en 	 	up	and	 arrest 	 ed 	 	.
But	in	fact	,	the	 major 	 ity 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 scar 	 ed 	 	.
 Every 	 one 	 	did	not	want	 re 	 ally 	 	to	get	in	trouble	.
A	dictator	can	not	live	 with 	 out 	 	the	force	.
 The 	 y 	 	want	to	make	people	live	in	fear	.
And	that	 psycho 	 logical 	 	 bar 	 rier 	 	of	fear	had	 work 	 ed 	 	for	so	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	here	 come 	 s 	 	the	Internet	,	technology	,	 Black 	 Ber 	 ry 	 	,	 S 	 MS 	 	.

But	they	are	still	 feel 	 ing 	 	the	pain	of	the	Egyptian	.
A	lot	of	us	,	we	're	not	 re 	 ally 	 	happy	when	we	see	a	video	of	an	Egyptian	man	who	's	eating	the	trash	while	 other 	 s 	 	are	 steal 	 ing 	 	 billion 	 s 	 	of	Egyptian	 pound 	 s 	 	from	the	wealth	of	the	country	.

He	was	 torture 	 d 	 	,	 brutal 	 ly 	 	 torture 	 d 	 	to	death	.
But	then	what	was	the	answer	of	the	regime	?
``	He	 choke 	 d 	 	on	a	pile	of	hash	''	--	that	was	 the 	 ir 	 	answer	:	``	He	's	a	criminal	.
He	's	 some 	 one 	 	who	 es 	 cap 	 ed 	 	from	all	these	bad	 thing 	 s 	 	.	''
But	people	did	not	 re 	 late 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	.
People	did	not	 believ 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	of	the	Internet	,	the	truth	 prevail 	 ed 	 	and	 every 	 one 	 	 k 	 new 	 	the	truth	.
And	 every 	 one 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	to	think	that	``	 th 	 is 	 	guy	could	be	my	brother	.	''

In	fact	,	one	of	the	most	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	was	,	``	Hey	,	let	's	have	a	silent	stand	.
Let	's	get	people	to	go	in	the	street	,	face	the	sea	,	 the 	 ir 	 	back	to	the	street	,	 dress 	 ed 	 	in	black	,	 stand 	 ing 	 	up	 silent 	 ly 	 	for	one	hour	,	 do 	 ing 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	and	then	just	 leav 	 ing 	 	,	going	back	home	.	''
For	some	people	,	that	was	like	,	``	 W 	 ow 	 	,	silent	stand	.
And	next	time	it	's	going	to	be	vibration	.	''
People	 we 	 re 	 	making	 f 	 un 	 	of	the	idea	.
But	 actual 	 ly 	 	when	people	went	to	the	street	--	the	first	time	it	was	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	in	 Alexa 	 nd 	 ria 	 	--	it	felt	like	--	it	was	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.	It	was	great	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 connect 	 ed 	 	people	from	the	virtual	world	,	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	them	to	the	real	world	,	sharing	the	same	dream	,	the	same	 frust 	 ration 	 	,	the	same	anger	,	the	same	 desir 	 e 	 	for	 free 	 dom 	 	.
And	they	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	thing	.
But	did	the	regime	learn	 any 	 thing 	 	?	Not	 re 	 ally 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 attack 	 ing 	 	them	.
 The 	 y 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ab 	 using 	 	them	,	 de 	 spite 	 	the	fact	of	how	 peace 	 ful 	 	these	 guy 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	--	they	 we 	 re 	 	not	even	 protest 	 ing 	 	.
And	 thing 	 s 	 	had	 develop 	 ed 	 	 un 	 til 	 	the	 Tunis 	 ian 	 	revolution	.
 Th 	 is 	 	whole	page	was	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 manage 	 d 	 	by	the	people	.
In	fact	,	the	 anonym 	 ous 	 	 ad 	 min 	 	job	was	to	collect	 idea 	 s 	 	,	help	people	to	vote	on	them	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	tell	them	what	they	are	 do 	 ing 	 	.
People	 we 	 re 	 	taking	 shot 	 s 	 	and	 photo 	 s 	 	;	people	 we 	 re 	 	 report 	 ing 	 	 viol 	 ations 	 	of	human	 right 	 s 	 	in	Egypt	;	people	 we 	 re 	 	 suggest 	 ing 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 vot 	 ing 	 	on	 idea 	 s 	 	,	and	then	they	 we 	 re 	 	 exec 	 uting 	 	the	 idea 	 s 	 	;	people	 we 	 re 	 	creating	 video 	 s 	 	.
 Every 	 thing 	 	was	 d 	 one 	 	by	the	people	to	the	people	,	and	that	's	the	power	of	the	Internet	.
There	was	no	 lead 	 er 	 	.
The	 lead 	 er 	 	was	 every 	 one 	 	on	that	page	.
The	 Tunis 	 ian 	 	experiment	,	 a 	 s 	 	Amir	was	 say 	 ing 	 	,	inspired	all	of	us	,	 show 	 ed 	 	us	that	there	is	a	way	.
Yes	we	can	.	We	can	do	it	.
We	have	the	same	 problem 	 s 	 	;	we	can	just	go	in	the	 street 	 s 	 	.
And	when	I	saw	the	street	on	the	25th	,	I	went	back	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Egypt	before	the	25th	is	never	going	to	be	Egypt	after	the	25th	.
The	revolution	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	not	the	end	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	the	end	.	''
I	was	 de 	 tain 	 ed 	 	on	the	27th	night	.
Thank	God	I	 announce 	 d 	 	the	 location 	 s 	 	and	 every 	 thing 	 	.
But	they	 de 	 tain 	 ed 	 	me	.
And	I	'm	not	going	to	talk	about	my	experience	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	about	me	.
I	was	 de 	 tain 	 ed 	 	for	12	 day 	 s 	 	,	 blind 	 fold 	 ed 	 	,	 hand 	 cuff 	 ed 	 	.
And	I	did	not	 re 	 ally 	 	hear	 any 	 thing 	 	.	I	did	not	know	 any 	 thing 	 	.
I	was	not	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	speak	with	 any 	 one 	 	.
And	I	went	out	.
The	next	day	I	was	in	Tahrir	.
 S 	 er 	 iously 	 	,	with	the	amount	of	change	I	had	 notice 	 d 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	square	,	I	thought	it	was	12	 year 	 s 	 	.
I	never	had	in	my	mind	to	see	 th 	 is 	 	Egyptian	,	the	 amaz 	 ing 	 	Egyptian	.
The	fear	is	no	 long 	 er 	 	fear	.
It	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	strength	--	it	's	power	.
People	 we 	 re 	 	so	 empower 	 ed 	 	.
It	was	 amaz 	 ing 	 	how	 every 	 one 	 	was	so	 empower 	 ed 	 	and	now	 ask 	 ing 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 right 	 s 	 	.
 Complete 	 ly 	 	 oppos 	 ite 	 	.
 Ex 	 trem 	 ism 	 	 be 	 came 	 	 toler 	 ance 	 	.
Who	would	[	have	]	 imagin 	 ed 	 	before	the	25th	,	if	I	tell	you	that	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 Christ 	 ians 	 	are	going	to	pray	and	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 Muslim 	 s 	 	are	going	to	protect	them	,	and	then	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 Muslim 	 s 	 	are	going	to	pray	and	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 Christ 	 ians 	 	are	going	to	protect	them	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
All	the	 stereo 	 type 	 s 	 	that	the	regime	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	put	on	us	through	 the 	 ir 	 	 so 	 - 	 call 	 ed 	 	 propag 	 and 	 a 	 	,	or	 main 	 stream 	 	media	,	are	proven	wrong	.
 Th 	 is 	 	whole	revolution	 show 	 ed 	 	us	how	 ug 	 ly 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	a	regime	was	and	how	great	and	 amaz 	 ing 	 	the	Egyptian	man	,	the	Egyptian	woman	,	how	simple	and	 amaz 	 ing 	 	these	people	are	 when 	 ever 	 	they	have	a	dream	.
When	I	saw	that	,	I	went	back	and	I	wrote	on	Facebook	.
And	that	was	a	personal	belief	,	 regard 	 less 	 	of	what	's	going	on	,	 regard 	 less 	 	of	the	 detail 	 s 	 	.
I	 s 	 aid 	 	that	,	``	We	are	going	to	win	.
We	are	going	to	win	 be 	 cause 	 	we	do	n't	understand	 politic 	 s 	 	.
We	're	going	to	win	 be 	 cause 	 	we	do	n't	play	 the 	 ir 	 	 dirt 	 y 	 	 game 	 s 	 	.
We	're	going	to	win	 be 	 cause 	 	we	do	n't	have	an	agenda	.

We	're	going	to	win	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	 dream 	 s 	 	.
We	're	going	to	win	 be 	 cause 	 	we	are	 will 	 ing 	 	to	stand	up	for	our	 dream 	 s 	 	.	''
And	that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	.	We	won	.
And	that	's	not	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 any 	 thing 	 	,	but	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 believ 	 ed 	 	in	our	dream	.
The	winning	here	is	not	the	whole	 detail 	 s 	 	of	what	's	going	to	happen	in	the	 politic 	 al 	 	scene	.
The	winning	is	the	winning	of	the	dignity	of	every	single	Egyptian	.
 Actu 	 ally 	 	,	I	had	 th 	 is 	 	taxi	driver	 tell 	 ing 	 	me	,	``	Listen	,	I	am	 breath 	 ing 	 	 free 	 dom 	 	.
I	feel	that	I	have	dignity	that	I	have	lost	for	so	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	.	''
For	me	that	's	winning	,	 regard 	 less 	 	of	all	the	 detail 	 s 	 	.
My	last	word	to	you	is	a	 state 	 ment 	 	I	 believ 	 e 	 	in	,	which	 Egyptian 	 s 	 	have	proven	to	be	true	,	that	the	power	of	the	people	is	much	 strong 	 er 	 	than	the	people	in	power	.
 Thank 	 s 	 	a	lot	.
I	want	to	address	the	issue	of	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
 Com 	 pass 	 ion 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 face 	 s 	 	.
Some	of	them	are	fierce	;	some	of	them	are	 wrath 	 ful 	 	;	some	of	them	are	tender	;	some	of	them	are	wise	.
A	line	that	the	Dalai	Lama	once	 s 	 aid 	 	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Love	and	 compass 	 ion 	 	are	 necess 	 ities 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	are	not	 luxur 	 ies 	 	.
 With 	 out 	 	them	,	 human 	 ity 	 	can	not	 surviv 	 e 	 	.	''
And	I	would	suggest	,	it	is	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 human 	 ity 	 	that	wo	n't	 surviv 	 e 	 	,	but	it	is	all	species	on	the	planet	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	've	heard	 to 	 day 	 	.
It	is	the	big	 cat 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	the	plankton	.
Two	 week 	 s 	 	ago	,	I	was	in	 Bang 	 al 	 ore 	 	in	India	.
I	was	so	 privilege 	 d 	 	to	be	able	to	teach	in	a	 ho 	 spice 	 	on	the	 out 	 skirt 	 s 	 	of	 Bang 	 al 	 ore 	 	.
And	early	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	I	went	 in 	 to 	 	the	ward	.
In	that	 ho 	 spice 	 	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	31	men	and	women	who	 we 	 re 	 	 active 	 ly 	 	 dy 	 ing 	 	.
And	I	 walk 	 ed 	 	up	to	the	 bed 	 side 	 	of	an	old	woman	who	was	 breath 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 rapid 	 ly 	 	,	fragile	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	in	the	 lat 	 ter 	 	phase	of	active	 dy 	 ing 	 	.
I	 look 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	her	face	.
I	 look 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	face	of	her	son	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	next	to	her	,	and	his	face	was	just	riven	with	grief	and	 con 	 fusion 	 	.
And	I	 remember 	 ed 	 	a	line	from	the	 Maha 	 bharata 	 	,	the	great	Indian	epic	:	``	What	is	the	most	 won 	 dr 	 ous 	 	thing	in	the	world	,	Yudhisthira	?	''
And	Yudhisthira	 re 	 plied 	 	,	``	The	most	 won 	 dr 	 ous 	 	thing	in	the	world	is	that	all	around	us	people	can	be	 dy 	 ing 	 	and	we	do	n't	 real 	 ize 	 	it	can	happen	to	us	.	''
I	 look 	 ed 	 	up	.
 T 	 end 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	31	 dy 	 ing 	 	people	 we 	 re 	 	young	women	from	 village 	 s 	 	around	 Bang 	 al 	 ore 	 	.
I	 look 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	face	of	one	of	these	women	,	and	I	saw	in	her	face	the	strength	that	 arise 	 s 	 	when	natural	 compass 	 ion 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	present	.
I	 watch 	 ed 	 	her	 hand 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	she	 bath 	 ed 	 	an	old	man	.
My	 gaz 	 e 	 	went	to	 an 	 other 	 	young	woman	 a 	 s 	 	she	 wipe 	 d 	 	the	face	of	 an 	 other 	 	 dy 	 ing 	 	person	.
And	it	 re 	 minded 	 	me	of	 some 	 thing 	 	that	I	had	just	 be 	 en 	 	present	for	.
Every	year	or	so	,	I	have	the	privilege	of	taking	 clinic 	 ians 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 Himalaya 	 s 	 	and	the	 Tibet 	 an 	 	Plateau	.
And	we	run	 clinic 	 s 	 	in	these	 ver 	 y 	 	remote	 region 	 s 	 	where	there	's	no	medical	care	 what 	 so 	 ever 	 	.
And	on	the	first	day	at	 Sim 	 ik 	 ot 	 	in	 Hum 	 la 	 	,	far	west	of	 Nep 	 al 	 	,	the	most	 imp 	 over 	 ish 	 ed 	 	region	of	 Nep 	 al 	 	,	an	old	man	came	in	 clutch 	 ing 	 	a	 bundl 	 e 	 	of	 rag 	 s 	 	.
And	he	 walk 	 ed 	 	in	,	and	 some 	 body 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	to	him	,	we	 real 	 ized 	 	he	was	deaf	,	and	we	 look 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 rag 	 s 	 	,	and	there	was	 th 	 is 	 	pair	of	 eye 	 s 	 	.
The	 rag 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 un 	 wrap 	 ped 	 	from	a	little	girl	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	body	was	 massive 	 ly 	 	 burn 	 ed 	 	.
 Aga 	 in 	 	,	the	 eye 	 s 	 	and	 hand 	 s 	 	of	Avalokiteshvara	.
It	was	the	young	women	,	the	health	 aid 	 s 	 	,	who	 clean 	 ed 	 	the	 wound 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	baby	and	 dress 	 ed 	 	the	 wound 	 s 	 	.
I	know	 t 	 hose 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	and	 eye 	 s 	 	;	they	 touch 	 ed 	 	me	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
 The 	 y 	 	 touch 	 ed 	 	me	at	that	time	.
 The 	 y 	 	have	 touch 	 ed 	 	me	 through 	 out 	 	my	68	 year 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	 touch 	 ed 	 	me	when	I	was	four	and	I	lost	my	 eye 	 sight 	 	and	was	 partial 	 ly 	 	 paralyze 	 d 	 	.
And	my	family	 br 	 ought 	 	in	a	woman	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	mother	had	 be 	 en 	 	a	slave	to	take	care	of	me	.
And	that	woman	did	not	have	 sentiment 	 al 	 	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
She	had	 phenomen 	 al 	 	strength	.
And	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	her	strength	,	I	 believ 	 e 	 	,	that	 be 	 came 	 	the	kind	of	mudra	and	 im 	 pri 	 matur 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	 gui 	 d 	 ing 	 	light	in	my	life	.
So	we	can	ask	:	What	is	 compass 	 ion 	 	 com 	 prise 	 d 	 	of	?
And	there	are	 vari 	 ous 	 	 facet 	 s 	 	.
And	there	's	 refer 	 ential 	 	and	 non 	 - 	 refer 	 ential 	 	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
But	first	,	 compass 	 ion 	 	is	 com 	 prise 	 d 	 	of	that	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	see	 clear 	 ly 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	nature	of	 suffer 	 ing 	 	.
It	is	that	ability	to	 re 	 ally 	 	stand	strong	and	to	 recogn 	 ize 	 	 al 	 so 	 	that	I	'm	not	 separat 	 e 	 	from	 th 	 is 	 	 suffer 	 ing 	 	.
But	that	is	not	 en 	 ough 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	which	 activate 	 s 	 	the	motor	cortex	,	 mean 	 s 	 	that	we	 aspir 	 e 	 	,	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	 aspir 	 e 	 	to	transform	 suffer 	 ing 	 	.
And	if	we	're	so	 bless 	 ed 	 	,	we	engage	in	 activ 	 ities 	 	that	transform	 suffer 	 ing 	 	.
But	 compass 	 ion 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 an 	 other 	 	component	,	and	that	component	is	 re 	 ally 	 	essential	.
That	component	is	that	we	can	not	be	 attach 	 ed 	 	to	 out 	 come 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	I	 work 	 ed 	 	with	 dy 	 ing 	 	people	for	over	40	 year 	 s 	 	.
I	had	the	privilege	of	 work 	 ing 	 	on	death	row	in	a	 maxim 	 um 	 	security	[	 pri 	 son 	 	]	for	six	 year 	 s 	 	.
And	I	 real 	 ized 	 	so	 clear 	 ly 	 	in	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	my	own	life	experience	,	from	 work 	 ing 	 	with	 dy 	 ing 	 	people	and	training	 care 	 giver 	 s 	 	,	that	any	 attach 	 ment 	 	to	 out 	 come 	 	would	distort	 deep 	 ly 	 	my	own	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	be	fully	present	to	the	whole	 catastroph 	 e 	 	.
And	when	I	 work 	 ed 	 	in	the	 pri 	 son 	 	system	,	it	was	so	clear	to	me	,	 th 	 is 	 	:	that	 man 	 y 	 	of	us	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	,	and	 al 	 most 	 	all	of	the	men	that	I	 work 	 ed 	 	with	on	death	row	,	the	 seed 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 compass 	 ion 	 	had	never	 be 	 en 	 	 water 	 ed 	 	.
That	 compass 	 ion 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	an	inherent	human	quality	.
It	is	there	 with 	 in 	 	every	human	 be 	 ing 	 	.
But	the	 condition 	 s 	 	for	 compass 	 ion 	 	to	be	 activate 	 d 	 	,	to	be	 arouse 	 d 	 	,	are	 part 	 icular 	 	 condition 	 s 	 	.
I	had	that	condition	,	to	a	certain	 ex 	 tent 	 	,	from	my	own	 child 	 hood 	 	 ill 	 ness 	 	.
Eve	Ensler	,	whom	you	'll	hear	 lat 	 er 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	had	that	condition	 activate 	 d 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 ly 	 	in	her	through	the	 vari 	 ous 	 	 water 	 s 	 	of	 suffer 	 ing 	 	that	she	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	through	.
And	what	is	 fasci 	 nating 	 	is	that	 compass 	 ion 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 ene 	 mies 	 	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	 ene 	 mies 	 	are	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 p 	 ity 	 	,	moral	 out 	 rage 	 	,	fear	.
And	you	know	,	we	have	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	a	world	,	that	is	 paralyze 	 d 	 	by	fear	.
And	in	that	 para 	 lysis 	 	,	of	course	,	our	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	for	 compass 	 ion 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	 paralyze 	 d 	 	.
The	 ver 	 y 	 	word	terror	is	global	.
The	 ver 	 y 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	terror	is	global	.
So	our	work	,	in	a	certain	way	,	is	to	address	 th 	 is 	 	 im 	 ago 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 arche 	 type 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 pervad 	 ed 	 	the	 psych 	 e 	 	of	our	entire	 glob 	 e 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	we	know	from	 neuro 	 science 	 	that	 compass 	 ion 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	some	 ver 	 y 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 qual 	 ities 	 	.
For	 ex 	 ample 	 	:	A	person	who	is	 cultiv 	 ating 	 	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	when	they	are	in	the	presence	of	 suffer 	 ing 	 	,	they	feel	that	 suffer 	 ing 	 	a	lot	more	than	 man 	 y 	 	other	people	do	.
 How 	 ever 	 	,	they	return	to	 base 	 line 	 	a	lot	 soon 	 er 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	 resili 	 ence 	 	.
 Man 	 y 	 	of	us	think	that	 compass 	 ion 	 	 drain 	 s 	 	us	,	but	I	promise	you	it	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 tru 	 ly 	 	 enliven 	 s 	 	us	.
 An 	 other 	 	thing	about	 compass 	 ion 	 	is	that	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 enhance 	 s 	 	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	neural	 integ 	 ration 	 	.
It	 hook 	 s 	 	up	all	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	brain	.
 An 	 other 	 	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	by	 vari 	 ous 	 	 research 	 ers 	 	at	 Em 	 ory 	 	and	at	 Da 	 vis 	 	and	so	on	,	is	that	 compass 	 ion 	 	 enhance 	 s 	 	our	 immun 	 e 	 	system	.
Hey	,	we	live	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 nox 	 ious 	 	world	.
 Mo 	 st 	 	of	us	are	 shrink 	 ing 	 	in	the	face	of	 psycho 	 - 	 social 	 	and	physical	 poison 	 s 	 	,	of	the	 toxin 	 s 	 	of	our	world	.
But	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	the	generation	of	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	 mobilize 	 s 	 	our	 immun 	 ity 	 	.
You	know	,	if	 compass 	 ion 	 	is	so	good	for	us	,	I	have	a	question	.
Why	do	n't	we	train	our	children	in	 compass 	 ion 	 	?
If	 compass 	 ion 	 	is	so	good	for	us	,	why	do	n't	we	train	our	health	care	 provide 	 rs 	 	in	 compass 	 ion 	 	so	that	they	can	do	what	they	're	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	do	,	which	is	to	 re 	 ally 	 	transform	 suffer 	 ing 	 	?
And	if	 compass 	 ion 	 	is	so	good	for	us	,	why	do	n't	we	vote	on	 compass 	 ion 	 	?
Why	do	n't	we	vote	for	people	in	our	government	based	on	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	so	that	we	can	have	a	more	 car 	 ing 	 	world	?
In	 Bud 	 d 	 h 	 ism 	 	,	we	say	,	``	it	 take 	 s 	 	a	strong	back	and	a	soft	front	.	''
It	 take 	 s 	 	tremendous	strength	of	the	back	to	 up 	 hold 	 	 your 	 self 	 	in	the	 mid 	 st 	 	of	 condition 	 s 	 	.
And	that	is	the	mental	quality	of	 equ 	 anim 	 ity 	 	.
But	it	 al 	 so 	 	 take 	 s 	 	a	soft	front	--	the	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	 re 	 ally 	 	be	open	to	the	world	 a 	 s 	 	it	is	,	to	have	an	 un 	 defend 	 ed 	 	heart	.
And	the	 arche 	 type 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	in	 Bud 	 d 	 h 	 ism 	 	is	Avalokiteshvara	,	 Ku 	 an 	 - 	 Y 	 in 	 	.
It	's	a	female	 arche 	 type 	 	:	she	who	 perceive 	 s 	 	the	 cri 	 es 	 	of	 suffer 	 ing 	 	in	the	world	.
She	 stand 	 s 	 	with	10,000	 arm 	 s 	 	,	and	in	every	hand	,	there	is	an	instrument	of	 liber 	 ation 	 	,	and	in	the	palm	of	every	hand	,	there	are	 eye 	 s 	 	,	and	these	are	the	 eye 	 s 	 	of	 wis 	 dom 	 	.
I	say	that	,	for	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	women	have	lived	,	 exempl 	 ified 	 	,	met	in	 in 	 timacy 	 	,	the	 arche 	 type 	 	of	Avalokitesvara	,	of	 Ku 	 an 	 - 	 Y 	 in 	 	,	she	who	 perceive 	 s 	 	the	 cri 	 es 	 	of	 suffer 	 ing 	 	in	the	world	.
Women	have	 manifest 	 ed 	 	for	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	the	strength	 ari 	 s 	 ing 	 	from	 compass 	 ion 	 	in	an	 un 	 filter 	 ed 	 	,	 un 	 mediate 	 d 	 	way	in	 per 	 ceiv 	 ing 	 	 suffer 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	is	.
 The 	 y 	 	have	 in 	 fused 	 	 socie 	 ties 	 	with	 kind 	 ness 	 	,	and	we	have	 re 	 ally 	 	felt	that	 a 	 s 	 	woman	after	woman	 ha 	 s 	 	stood	on	 th 	 is 	 	stage	in	the	past	day	and	a	half	.
And	they	have	 actual 	 ized 	 	 compass 	 ion 	 	through	direct	action	.
 Jo 	 dy 	 	 William 	 s 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	it	:	It	's	good	to	meditate	.
I	'm	sorry	,	you	've	got	to	do	a	little	bit	of	that	,	 Jo 	 dy 	 	.
Step	back	,	give	your	mother	a	break	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
But	the	other	side	of	the	 equ 	 ation 	 	is	you	've	got	to	come	out	of	your	cave	.
You	have	to	come	 in 	 to 	 	the	world	like	Asanga	did	,	who	was	looking	to	 real 	 ize 	 	 Ma 	 it 	 re 	 ya 	 	Buddha	after	12	 year 	 s 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	the	cave	.
He	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	I	'm	out	of	here	.	''
He	's	going	down	the	path	.
He	 s 	 ees 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	in	the	path	.
He	 look 	 s 	 	,	it	's	a	dog	,	he	 drop 	 s 	 	to	his	 knee 	 s 	 	.
He	 s 	 ees 	 	that	the	dog	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	big	wound	on	 it 	 s 	 	leg	.
The	wound	is	just	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	maggots	.
He	 put 	 s 	 	out	his	tongue	in	order	to	 re 	 move 	 	the	maggots	,	so	 a 	 s 	 	not	to	harm	them	.
And	at	that	moment	,	the	dog	 transform 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	Buddha	of	love	and	 kind 	 ness 	 	.
I	 believ 	 e 	 	that	women	and	 girl 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	have	to	partner	in	a	 power 	 ful 	 	way	with	men	--	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 father 	 s 	 	,	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 son 	 s 	 	,	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 brother 	 s 	 	,	with	the	 plumb 	 ers 	 	,	the	road	 build 	 ers 	 	,	the	 care 	 giver 	 s 	 	,	the	 doctor 	 s 	 	,	the	 lawyer 	 s 	 	,	with	our	 p 	 resident 	 	,	and	with	all	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
The	women	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	are	 lot 	 uses 	 	in	a	sea	of	fire	.
May	we	 actual 	 ize 	 	that	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	for	women	 every 	 where 	 	.
Thank	you	.
I	was	one	of	the	 found 	 ing 	 	 member 	 s 	 	of	the	 Ax 	 is 	 	of	 E 	 vil 	 	 Come 	 dy 	 	Tour	.
The	other	 found 	 ing 	 	 member 	 s 	 	 include 	 d 	 	 Ah 	 med 	 	 Ah 	 med 	 	,	who	is	an	 Egyptian 	 - 	 American 	 	,	who	 actual 	 ly 	 	had	the	idea	to	go	to	the	Middle	East	and	try	it	out	.
 Be 	 fore 	 	we	went	out	 a 	 s 	 	a	tour	,	he	went	out	 s 	 olo 	 	and	did	it	first	.
 Th 	 en 	 	there	was	 Ar 	 on 	 	 Ka 	 der 	 	,	who	was	the	 Palestinian 	 - 	 American 	 	.
And	then	there	was	me	,	the	 Iranian 	 - 	 American 	 	of	the	group	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	 be 	 ing 	 	 Iranian 	 - 	 American 	 	 present 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	own	set	of	 problem 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	know	.
 T 	 hose 	 	two	 count 	 ries 	 	are	n't	 get 	 ting 	 	 a 	 long 	 	these	 day 	 s 	 	.
So	it	 cause 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	inner	conflict	,	you	know	,	like	part	of	me	 like 	 s 	 	me	,	part	of	me	 hate 	 s 	 	me	.
Part	of	me	 think 	 s 	 	I	should	have	a	nuclear	program	,	the	other	part	 think 	 s 	 	I	ca	n't	be	 trust 	 ed 	 	with	one	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	 dilemma 	 s 	 	I	have	every	day	.
But	I	was	born	in	Iran	;	I	'm	now	an	American	citizen	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	I	have	the	American	 pass 	 port 	 	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	I	can	travel	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	if	you	 on 	 ly 	 	have	the	Iranian	 pass 	 port 	 	,	you	're	kind	of	 limit 	 ed 	 	to	the	 count 	 ries 	 	you	can	go	to	with	open	 arm 	 s 	 	,	you	know	--	 S 	 y 	 ria 	 	,	Venezuela	,	North	Korea	.
So	 any 	 one 	 	who	's	gotten	 the 	 ir 	 	 pass 	 port 	 	in	America	will	tell	you	,	when	you	get	your	 pass 	 port 	 	,	it	still	 say 	 s 	 	what	country	you	 we 	 re 	 	born	in	.
So	I	remember	 get 	 ting 	 	my	American	 pass 	 port 	 	.
I	was	like	,	``	Woohoo	!	I	'm	going	to	travel	.	''
And	I	 open 	 ed 	 	it	up	,	it	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 Bor 	 n 	 	in	Iran	.	''	I	'm	like	,	``	Oh	,	come	on	,	man	.	''
``	I	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	go	 place 	 s 	 	.	''
But	what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	is	,	I	've	never	had	trouble	 travel 	 ing 	 	in	any	other	Western	 count 	 ries 	 	with	my	American	 pass 	 port 	 	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	it	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 Bor 	 n 	 	in	Iran	.	''	No	 problem 	 s 	 	.
Where	I	've	had	some	 problem 	 s 	 	is	some	of	the	Arab	 count 	 ries 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	I	guess	some	of	the	Arab	 count 	 ries 	 	are	n't	 get 	 ting 	 	 a 	 long 	 	with	Iran	either	.
And	so	I	was	in	 Ku 	 wait 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	 do 	 ing 	 	a	 come 	 dy 	 	show	with	some	other	American	 comedian 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	all	went	through	,	and	then	the	border	patrol	saw	my	American	 pass 	 port 	 	.
``	Ah	ha	!	American	,	great	.	''
 Th 	 en 	 	he	 open 	 ed 	 	it	up	.	``	 Bor 	 n 	 	in	Iran	?	Wait	.	''
And	he	 start 	 ed 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	me	 question 	 s 	 	.
He	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	What	is	your	father	's	name	?	''
I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Well	,	he	's	 pass 	 ed 	 	away	,	but	his	name	was	Khosro	.	''
He	 go 	 es 	 	,	``	What	is	your	 grand 	 father 	 	's	name	?	''
I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	He	 pass 	 ed 	 	away	a	long	time	ago	.
 Hi 	 s 	 	name	was	 Jab 	 bar 	 	.	''
He	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	You	wait	.	I	'll	be	back	,	''	and	he	 walk 	 ed 	 	away	.
And	I	 start 	 ed 	 	 freak 	 ing 	 	out	,	 be 	 cause 	 	I	do	n't	know	what	kind	of	crap	my	 grand 	 father 	 	was	 in 	 to 	 	.
 Though 	 t 	 	the	guy	was	going	to	come	back	and	be	like	,	``	We	've	 be 	 en 	 	looking	for	you	for	200	 year 	 s 	 	.	''
``	Your	 grand 	 father 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 park 	 ing 	 	 viol 	 ation 	 	.	It	's	way	 over 	 due 	 	.
You	owe	us	two	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	.	''
But	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	when	I	talk	,	I	speak	with	an	American	accent	,	which	you	would	think	 a 	 s 	 	an	 Iranian 	 - 	 American 	 	 a 	 ctor 	 	,	I	should	be	able	to	play	any	part	,	good	,	bad	,	what	have	you	.
But	a	lot	of	 time 	 s 	 	in	 Hol 	 ly 	 wood 	 	,	when	 cast 	 ing 	 	 director 	 s 	 	find	out	you	're	of	Middle	 East 	 ern 	 	 d 	 escent 	 	,	they	go	,	``	Oh	,	you	're	Iranian	.	Great	.
Can	you	say	'I	will	kill	you	in	the	name	of	 A 	 llah 	 	?	'	''	``	I	could	say	that	,	but	what	if	I	 we 	 re 	 	to	say	,	'Hello	.	I	'm	your	doctor	?	'	''	 The 	 y 	 	go	,	``	Great	.	And	then	you	hijack	the	hospital	.	''
Like	I	think	you	're	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	the	point	here	.
Do	n't	get	me	wrong	,	I	do	n't	mind	 play 	 ing 	 	bad	 guy 	 s 	 	.
I	want	to	play	a	bad	guy	.	I	want	to	rob	a	bank	.
I	want	to	rob	a	bank	in	a	film	.	I	want	to	rob	a	bank	in	a	film	,	but	do	it	with	a	gun	,	with	a	gun	,	not	with	a	bomb	 s 	 trapped 	 	around	me	,	right	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	I	imagine	the	director	:	``	Maz	,	I	think	your	character	would	rob	the	bank	with	a	bomb	around	him	.	''
``	Why	would	I	do	that	?
If	I	want	the	money	,	why	would	I	kill	 my 	 self 	 	?	''
Right	.
``	 G 	 im 	 	me	all	your	money	,	or	I	'll	blow	 my 	 self 	 	up	.	''
``	Well	,	then	blow	 your 	 self 	 	up	.
Just	do	it	 out 	 side 	 	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	.	''
But	the	fact	is	,	there	's	good	people	 every 	 where 	 	.
That	's	what	I	try	and	show	in	my	 stand 	 - 	 up 	 	.	There	's	good	people	 every 	 where 	 	.
All	it	 take 	 s 	 	in	one	person	to	mess	it	up	.
Like	a	couple	 month 	 s 	 	ago	in	 Time 	 s 	 	Square	in	New	York	,	there	was	 th 	 is 	 	 Pakistan 	 i 	 	Muslim	guy	who	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	blow	up	a	car	bomb	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	I	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	be	in	 Time 	 s 	 	Square	that	night	 do 	 ing 	 	a	 come 	 dy 	 	show	.
And	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	before	that	,	there	was	a	white	American	guy	in	 Au 	 s 	 tin 	 	,	Texas	who	flew	his	 air 	 plane 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 IR 	 S 	 	building	,	and	I	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	be	in	 Au 	 s 	 tin 	 	that	day	 do 	 ing 	 	a	 stand 	 - 	 up 	 	 come 	 dy 	 	show	.
 N 	 ow 	 	I	'll	tell	you	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	Middle	 East 	 ern 	 	male	,	when	you	show	up	around	a	lot	of	these	 activ 	 ities 	 	,	you	start	 feel 	 ing 	 	 guilt 	 y 	 	at	one	point	.
I	was	 watch 	 ing 	 	the	news	.	I	'm	like	,	``	Am	I	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	crap	?	''
``	I	did	n't	get	the	memo	.	What	's	going	on	?	''
But	what	was	 interest 	 ing 	 	was	,	the	 Pakistan 	 i 	 	Muslim	guy	--	see	he	 give 	 s 	 	a	bad	name	to	 Muslim 	 s 	 	and	Middle	 East 	 erners 	 	and	 Pakistan 	 is 	 	from	all	over	the	world	.
And	one	thing	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	there	was	 al 	 so 	 	the	 Pakistan 	 i 	 	Taliban	took	credit	for	that	 fail 	 ed 	 	car	 bomb 	 ing 	 	.
My	question	is	:	why	would	you	take	credit	for	a	 fail 	 ed 	 	car	 bomb 	 ing 	 	?
``	We	just	 want 	 ed 	 	to	say	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	.	''
``	And	 further 	 more 	 	,	it	is	the	thought	that	 count 	 s 	 	.	''
``	And	in	 con 	 clusion 	 	,	win	some	,	lose	some	.	''
But	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	was	,	when	the	white	guy	flew	his	plane	 in 	 to 	 	the	building	,	I	know	all	my	Middle	 East 	 ern 	 	and	Muslim	 friend 	 s 	 	in	the	 Stat 	 es 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 watch 	 ing 	 	TV	,	going	,	``	 P 	 lease 	 	,	do	n't	be	Middle	 East 	 ern 	 	.
Do	n't	be	 Ha 	 s 	 s 	 an 	 	.	Do	n't	be	 Hu 	 ssein 	 	.	''
And	the	name	came	out	Jack	.	I	'm	like	,	``	 Wooo 	 o 	 	!
That	's	not	one	of	us	.	''
But	I	 ke 	 pt 	 	 watch 	 ing 	 	the	news	in	case	they	came	back	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	like	,	``	 Be 	 fore 	 	he	did	it	,	he	 convert 	 ed 	 	to	Islam	.	''
``	 Dam 	 n 	 	it	!	Why	Jack	?	Why	?	''
But	the	fact	is	,	I	've	 be 	 en 	 	 luck 	 y 	 	to	get	a	chance	to	perform	all	over	the	world	,	and	I	did	a	lot	of	 show 	 s 	 	in	the	Middle	East	.
I	just	did	a	 seven 	 - 	 country 	 	 s 	 olo 	 	tour	.
I	was	in	 O 	 man 	 	,	and	I	was	in	Saudi	 Arab 	 ia 	 	.
I	was	in	Dubai	.
And	it	's	great	,	there	's	good	people	 every 	 where 	 	.
And	you	learn	great	 thing 	 s 	 	about	these	 place 	 s 	 	.
I	 encourag 	 e 	 	people	 al 	 ways 	 	to	go	visit	these	 place 	 s 	 	.
For	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	Dubai	--	cool	place	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	 obsess 	 ed 	 	with	 hav 	 ing 	 	the	 big 	 gest 	 	,	 tall 	 est 	 	,	 long 	 est 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	all	know	.
 The 	 y 	 	have	a	mall	there	,	the	Dubai	Mall	.
It	is	so	big	,	they	have	 taxi 	 s 	 	in	the	mall	.
I	was	 walk 	 ing 	 	.	I	heard	``	 Bee 	 p 	 	,	beep	.	''
I	'm	like	,	``	What	are	you	 do 	 ing 	 	here	?	''
He	 go 	 es 	 	,	``	I	'm	going	to	the	 Z 	 ara 	 	store	.	It	's	three	 mile 	 s 	 	away	.
Out	of	my	way	.	Out	of	my	way	.	Out	of	my	way	.	''
And	what	's	crazy	--	there	's	a	 recess 	 ion 	 	going	on	,	even	in	Dubai	,	but	you	would	n't	know	by	the	 price 	 s 	 	.
Like	in	the	Dubai	Mall	,	they	sell	 froze 	 n 	 	yogurt	by	the	gram	.
It	's	like	a	drug	deal	.
I	was	 walk 	 ing 	 	by	.	The	guy	 go 	 es 	 	,	``	Psst	.	 Hab 	 ibi 	 	,	my	friend	.	''
``	You	want	some	 froze 	 n 	 	yogurt	?
Come	here	.	Come	here	.	Come	here	.
I	have	one	gram	,	five	gram	,	10	gram	.	How	 man 	 y 	 	gram	do	you	want	?	''
I	 b 	 ought 	 	five	 gram 	 s 	 	.	10	 dollar 	 s 	 	.	10	 dollar 	 s 	 	!	I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	What	's	in	 th 	 is 	 	?	''
He	's	like	,	``	Good	stuff	,	man	.	 Columbia 	 n 	 	.	Top	of	the	line	.	Top	of	the	line	.	''
The	other	thing	you	learn	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	when	you	travel	to	these	 count 	 ries 	 	in	the	Middle	East	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	in	 Lat 	 in 	 	American	 count 	 ries 	 	,	South	American	 count 	 ries 	 	--	a	lot	of	 time 	 s 	 	when	they	build	stuff	,	there	's	no	 rule 	 s 	 	and	 regulat 	 ions 	 	.
For	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	I	took	my	two	 year 	 - 	 old 	 	son	to	the	 play 	 ground 	 	at	the	Dubai	Mall	.
And	I	've	taken	my	two	 year 	 - 	 old 	 	son	to	 play 	 ground 	 s 	 	all	over	the	 Unit 	 ed 	 	 Stat 	 es 	 	.
And	when	you	put	your	two	 year 	 - 	 old 	 	on	a	slide	in	the	 Unit 	 ed 	 	 Stat 	 es 	 	,	they	put	 some 	 thing 	 	on	the	slide	to	 s 	 low 	 	the	kid	down	 a 	 s 	 	he	 come 	 s 	 	down	the	slide	.
Not	in	the	Middle	East	.
I	put	my	two	 year 	 - 	 old 	 	on	the	slide	;	he	went	frrmrmm	!	He	took	off	.
I	went	down	.	I	go	,	``	Where	's	my	son	?	''
``	On	the	third	floor	,	 s 	 ir 	 	.	On	the	third	floor	.	''
``	You	take	a	taxi	.	You	go	to	 Z 	 ara 	 	.	Make	a	left	.	''
``	 T 	 ry 	 	the	yogurt	.	It	's	 ver 	 y 	 	good	.	 Li 	 ttle 	 	expensive	.	''
But	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	I	try	to	do	with	my	 stand 	 - 	 up 	 	is	to	break	 stereo 	 type 	 s 	 	.
And	I	've	 be 	 en 	 	 guilt 	 y 	 	of	 stereo 	 ty 	 ping 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
I	was	in	Dubai	.	And	there	's	a	lot	of	 Indian 	 s 	 	who	work	in	Dubai	.
And	they	do	n't	get	paid	that	well	.
And	I	got	it	in	my	head	that	all	the	 Indian 	 s 	 	there	must	be	 work 	 ers 	 	.
And	I	 for 	 got 	 	there	's	 obvious 	 ly 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	 Indian 	 s 	 	in	Dubai	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
I	was	 do 	 ing 	 	a	show	,	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	We	're	going	to	 s 	 end 	 	a	driver	to	pick	you	up	.	''
So	I	went	down	to	the	lobby	,	and	I	saw	 th 	 is 	 	Indian	guy	.
I	go	,	``	He	's	got	to	be	my	driver	.	''
 Be 	 cause 	 	he	was	 stand 	 ing 	 	there	in	like	a	cheap	suit	,	thin	 must 	 ache 	 	,	 star 	 ing 	 	at	me	.

I	'm	going	to	show	you	how	 terror 	 ism 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 interact 	 s 	 	with	our	 dai 	 ly 	 	life	.
15	 year 	 s 	 	ago	I	 receiv 	 ed 	 	a	phone	call	from	a	friend	.
At	the	time	he	was	looking	after	the	 right 	 s 	 	of	 politic 	 al 	 	 prisoner 	 s 	 	in	Italian	 jail 	 s 	 	.
He	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	if	I	 want 	 ed 	 	to	interview	the	Red	 Brigade 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	may	remember	,	the	Red	 Brigade 	 s 	 	was	a	terrorist	,	 Marx 	 ist 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 	which	was	 ver 	 y 	 	active	in	 It 	 a 	 ly 	 	from	the	1960s	 un 	 til 	 	the	 mid 	 - 	 19 	 80 	 s 	 	.
 A 	 s 	 	part	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	the	Red	 Brigade 	 s 	 	never	spoke	with	 any 	 body 	 	,	not	even	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 lawyer 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	 s 	 at 	 	in	silence	through	 the 	 ir 	 	 trail 	 s 	 	,	 wav 	 ing 	 	 occasion 	 ally 	 	at	family	and	 friend 	 s 	 	.
In	1993	they	 declare 	 d 	 	the	end	of	the	 arm 	 ed 	 	struggle	.
And	they	drew	a	list	of	people	with	whom	they	would	talk	,	and	tell	 the 	 ir 	 	story	.
And	I	was	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	people	.
When	I	 ask 	 ed 	 	my	friend	why	the	Red	 Brigade 	 s 	 	want	to	talk	to	me	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	that	the	female	 member 	 s 	 	of	the	 organ 	 ization 	 	had	 actual 	 ly 	 	 support 	 ed 	 	my	name	.
In	 part 	 icular 	 	,	one	person	had	put	it	forward	.
She	was	my	 child 	 hood 	 	friend	.
She	had	 join 	 ed 	 	the	Red	 Brigade 	 s 	 	and	 be 	 came 	 	a	 lead 	 er 	 	of	the	 organ 	 ization 	 	.
 Natural 	 ly 	 	,	I	did	n't	know	that	 un 	 til 	 	the	day	she	was	 arrest 	 ed 	 	.
In	fact	,	I	read	it	in	the	 news 	 paper 	 	.
At	the	time	of	the	phone	call	I	just	had	a	baby	,	I	 success 	 fully 	 	 complete 	 d 	 	a	management	 buy 	 out 	 	to	the	company	I	was	 work 	 ing 	 	with	,	and	the	last	thing	I	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	was	to	go	back	home	and	 tour 	 ing 	 	the	 high 	 - 	 security 	 	 pri 	 son 	 s 	 	.
But	 th 	 is 	 	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	I	did	 be 	 cause 	 	I	 want 	 ed 	 	to	know	what	had	 turn 	 ed 	 	my	best	friend	 in 	 to 	 	a	terrorist	,	and	why	she	'd	never	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	recruit	me	.
So	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	I	did	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	I	found	the	answer	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
I	 actual 	 ly 	 	had	 fail 	 ed 	 	the	 psycho 	 logical 	 	 pro 	 filing 	 	of	a	terrorist	.
The	center	 commit 	 tee 	 	of	the	Red	 Brigade 	 s 	 	had	 judg 	 ed 	 	me	too	 single 	 - 	 minded 	 	and	too	 opinion 	 ated 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	good	terrorist	.
My	friend	,	on	the	other	hand	,	she	was	a	good	terrorist	 be 	 cause 	 	she	was	 ver 	 y 	 	good	at	 follow 	 ing 	 	 order 	 s 	 	.
She	 al 	 so 	 	 embrace 	 d 	 	violence	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	she	 believ 	 ed 	 	that	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	to	 un 	 block 	 	what	,	at	the	time	,	was	known	 a 	 s 	 	a	 block 	 ed 	 	 demo 	 cracy 	 	,	 It 	 a 	 ly 	 	,	a	country	run	by	the	same	party	for	35	 year 	 s 	 	was	the	 arm 	 s 	 	struggle	.
At	the	same	time	,	while	I	was	 interview 	 ing 	 	the	Red	 Brigade 	 s 	 	,	I	 al 	 so 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	 the 	 ir 	 	life	was	not	 rul 	 ed 	 	by	 politic 	 s 	 	or	 ideo 	 logy 	 	,	but	 actual 	 ly 	 	was	 rul 	 ed 	 	by	 economic 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 constant 	 ly 	 	short	of	cash	.
 The 	 y 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 constant 	 ly 	 	 search 	 ing 	 	for	cash	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	 contr 	 ary 	 	to	what	 man 	 y 	 	people	 believ 	 e 	 	,	 terror 	 ism 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	expensive	business	.
I	'll	give	you	an	idea	.
In	the	1970s	,	the	 turn 	 over 	 	of	the	Red	 Brigade 	 s 	 	on	a	 year 	 ly 	 	 bas 	 is 	 	was	seven	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 rough 	 ly 	 	between	100	and	150	million	,	 to 	 day 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	you	know	,	if	you	live	 under 	 ground 	 	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	to	produce	 th 	 is 	 	amount	of	money	.
But	 th 	 is 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 explain 	 s 	 	why	,	when	I	was	 interview 	 ing 	 	the	Red	 Brigade 	 s 	 	,	and	then	,	 lat 	 er 	 	on	,	other	 arm 	 s 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 member 	 s 	 	of	 al 	 - 	 Zarqawi 	 	group	in	the	Middle	East	,	 every 	 body 	 	was	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 reluct 	 ant 	 	to	talk	about	 ideo 	 logy 	 	,	or	 politic 	 s 	 	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	they	had	no	idea	.
The	 politic 	 al 	 	vision	of	a	terrorist	 organ 	 ization 	 	is	 decide 	 d 	 	by	the	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	,	which	,	 general 	 ly 	 	,	is	never	more	than	five	to	seven	people	.
All	the	 other 	 s 	 	do	,	day	in	and	day	out	,	is	search	for	money	.
 O 	 nce 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	I	was	 interview 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 - 	 timer 	 	from	the	Red	 Brigade 	 s 	 	.
It	was	a	psychiatrist	.	He	 love 	 d 	 	 s 	 ailing 	 	.
He	was	a	 re 	 ally 	 	keen	 sail 	 or 	 	.	And	he	had	 th 	 is 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	boat	.
And	he	told	me	that	the	best	time	of	his	life	was	when	he	was	a	member	of	the	Red	 Brigade 	 s 	 	and	he	went	 s 	 ailing 	 	,	every	summer	,	back	and	forth	from	 Le 	 ba 	 non 	 	,	where	he	would	pick	up	Soviet	 weapon 	 s 	 	from	the	PLO	,	and	then	carry	them	all	the	way	to	Sardinia	where	the	other	 arm 	 s 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 	from	 Euro 	 pe 	 	would	go	and	take	 the 	 ir 	 	share	of	the	 arm 	 s 	 	.
For	that	service	the	Red	 Brigade 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	paid	a	fee	,	which	went	to	fund	 the 	 ir 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 	.
So	,	 be 	 cause 	 	I	am	a	trained	economist	and	I	think	in	economic	 term 	 s 	 	,	all	of	the	sudden	I	thought	,	 may 	 be 	 	there	is	 some 	 thing 	 	here	.
 May 	 be 	 	there	is	a	link	,	a	commercial	link	,	between	one	 organ 	 ization 	 	and	 an 	 other 	 	one	.
But	it	was	 on 	 ly 	 	when	I	 interview 	 ed 	 	 Mar 	 io 	 	 Mor 	 etti 	 	,	the	head	of	the	Red	 Brigade 	 s 	 	,	the	man	who	 kidnap 	 ped 	 	and	 kill 	 ed 	 	 Al 	 do 	 	Moro	,	Italian	 form 	 er 	 	prime	 mini 	 ster 	 	,	that	I	 final 	 ly 	 	 real 	 ized 	 	that	 terror 	 ism 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	business	.
I	was	 hav 	 ing 	 	lunch	with	him	in	a	 high 	 - 	 security 	 	 pri 	 son 	 	in	 It 	 a 	 ly 	 	.
And	 a 	 s 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	eating	,	I	had	the	distinct	 feel 	 ing 	 	that	I	was	back	in	the	city	of	London	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	lunch	with	a	fellow	 bank 	 er 	 	or	an	economist	.
 Th 	 is 	 	guy	thought	in	the	same	way	I	did	.
So	,	I	 decide 	 d 	 	that	I	 want 	 ed 	 	to	investigate	the	 economic 	 s 	 	of	 terror 	 ism 	 	.
 Natural 	 ly 	 	,	 no 	 body 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	fund	my	research	.
In	fact	,	I	think	 man 	 y 	 	people	thought	that	I	was	a	bit	crazy	.
You	know	,	that	woman	that	 go 	 es 	 	around	to	 found 	 ations 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	for	money	,	 think 	 ing 	 	about	the	 economic 	 s 	 	of	 terror 	 ism 	 	.
So	,	in	the	end	,	I	took	a	decision	that	,	in	retrospect	,	did	change	my	life	.
I	 s 	 old 	 	my	company	,	and	funded	the	research	 my 	 self 	 	.
And	what	I	 discover 	 ed 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	parallel	 re 	 ality 	 	,	 an 	 other 	 	 inter 	 national 	 	economic	system	,	which	 run 	 s 	 	parallel	to	our	own	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 create 	 d 	 	by	 arm 	 s 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	since	the	end	of	World	War	 I 	 I 	 	.
And	what	is	even	more	 shock 	 ing 	 	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	system	 ha 	 s 	 	 follow 	 ed 	 	,	step	by	step	,	the	evolution	of	our	own	system	,	of	our	Western	 capital 	 ism 	 	.
And	there	are	three	main	 stage 	 s 	 	.
The	first	one	is	the	state	sponsor	of	 terror 	 ism 	 	.
The	second	one	is	the	 privat 	 ization 	 	of	 terror 	 ism 	 	.
And	the	third	,	of	course	,	is	the	 global 	 ization 	 	of	 terror 	 ism 	 	.
So	,	state	sponsor	of	 terror 	 ism 	 	,	feature	of	the	 Col 	 d 	 	War	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	when	the	two	 super 	 power 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 fight 	 ing 	 	a	war	by	 pr 	 oxy 	 	,	 a 	 long 	 	the	 per 	 iph 	 ery 	 	of	the	sphere	of	influence	,	fully	 fund 	 ing 	 	 arm 	 s 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	.
A	mix	of	legal	and	 il 	 legal 	 	 activ 	 ities 	 	is	used	.
So	,	the	link	between	crime	and	terror	is	 establish 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	early	on	.
And	here	is	the	best	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	the	 Contra 	 s 	 	in	Nicaragua	,	 create 	 d 	 	by	the	 CI 	 A 	 	,	 legal 	 ly 	 	funded	by	the	U.S.	Congress	,	 il 	 legal 	 ly 	 	funded	by	the	 Re 	 a 	 gan 	 	 administr 	 ation 	 	via	 cover 	 t 	 	operation	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	the	 Iran 	 - 	 Contra 	 	 Af 	 fair 	 	.
 Th 	 en 	 	 come 	 s 	 	the	late	1970s	,	early	'80s	,	and	some	 group 	 s 	 	 success 	 fully 	 	carry	out	the	 privat 	 ization 	 	of	 terror 	 ism 	 	.
So	,	they	gain	 in 	 depend 	 ence 	 	from	the	sponsor	,	and	start	 fund 	 ing 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	we	see	a	mix	of	legal	and	 il 	 legal 	 	 activ 	 ities 	 	.
So	,	 Ara 	 fat 	 	used	to	get	a	 percent 	 age 	 	of	the	 s 	 mug 	 gling 	 	of	 hash 	 ish 	 	from	Bekáa	 Valle 	 y 	 	,	which	is	the	 val 	 ley 	 	between	 Le 	 ba 	 non 	 	and	 S 	 y 	 ria 	 	.
And	the	 IR 	 A 	 	,	which	control	the	private	 transport 	 ation 	 	system	in	 North 	 ern 	 	 I 	 re 	 land 	 	,	did	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	thing	.
So	,	every	single	time	that	 some 	 body 	 	got	 in 	 to 	 	a	taxi	in	 Bel 	 fast 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 know 	 ing 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	was	 fund 	 ing 	 	the	 IR 	 A 	 	.
But	the	great	change	came	,	of	course	,	with	 global 	 ization 	 	and	 de 	 regulat 	 ion 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	when	 arm 	 s 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	link	up	,	 al 	 so 	 	 financial 	 ly 	 	,	with	each	other	.
But	above	all	,	they	 start 	 ed 	 	to	do	serious	business	with	the	world	of	crime	.
And	together	they	 money 	 - 	 launder 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 dirt 	 y 	 	business	through	the	same	channel	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	when	we	see	the	birth	of	the	 trans 	 national 	 	 arm 	 s 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 	Al	Qaeda	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	an	 organ 	 ization 	 	that	can	raise	money	 a 	 cross 	 	border	.
But	 al 	 so 	 	that	is	able	to	carry	out	 attack 	 s 	 	in	more	than	one	country	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	 de 	 regulat 	 ion 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	back	 r 	 ogue 	 	 economic 	 s 	 	.
So	what	is	 r 	 ogue 	 	 economic 	 s 	 	?
 R 	 ogue 	 	 economic 	 s 	 	is	a	force	which	is	 constant 	 ly 	 	 lurk 	 ing 	 	in	the	 back 	 ground 	 	of	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
It	 come 	 s 	 	back	at	 time 	 s 	 	of	great	 transform 	 ation 	 	,	 global 	 ization 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 transform 	 ations 	 	.
It	is	at	 th 	 is 	 	 time 	 s 	 	in	which	 politic 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 lose 	 s 	 	control	of	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	and	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	 r 	 ogue 	 	force	 work 	 ing 	 	against	us	.
It	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	before	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
It	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	with	the	fall	of	the	 Ro 	 man 	 	Empire	.
It	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	with	 Indus 	 trial 	 	 R 	 evolution 	 	.
And	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	,	with	the	fall	of	the	 Ber 	 lin 	 	wall	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	I	 calcul 	 ated 	 	how	big	was	 th 	 is 	 	 inter 	 national 	 	economic	system	 compose 	 d 	 	by	crime	,	terror	,	and	 il 	 legal 	 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	before	9-11	.
And	it	is	a	 stagger 	 ing 	 	1.5	trillion	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
It	is	 trillion 	 s 	 	,	it	's	not	 billion 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	about	twice	the	 G 	 DP 	 	of	the	 Unit 	 ed 	 	 K 	 ing 	 dom 	 	,	soon	will	be	more	,	 consider 	 ing 	 	where	 th 	 is 	 	country	is	going	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	 un 	 til 	 	9-11	,	the	bulk	of	all	 th 	 is 	 	money	flew	 in 	 to 	 	the	U.S.	 eco 	 nomy 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	bulk	of	the	money	was	 denomi 	 nated 	 	in	U.S.	 dollar 	 s 	 	and	the	money	 launder 	 ing 	 	was	taking	place	 in 	 side 	 	the	 Unit 	 ed 	 	 Stat 	 es 	 	.
The	entry	point	,	of	course	,	of	most	of	 th 	 is 	 	money	 we 	 re 	 	the	 off 	 - 	 shore 	 	 facil 	 ities 	 	.
So	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	vital	 inject 	 ion 	 	of	cash	 in 	 to 	 	the	U.S.	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	when	I	went	to	look	at	the	 figure 	 s 	 	of	the	U.S.	money	supply	,	the	U.S.	money	supply	is	the	amount	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	that	the	 Feder 	 al 	 	 Re 	 serve 	 	 print 	 s 	 	every	year	in	order	to	satisfy	the	 in 	 crease 	 	in	the	demand	for	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	which	,	of	course	,	 reflect 	 s 	 	the	growth	of	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
So	,	when	I	went	to	look	at	 t 	 hose 	 	 figure 	 s 	 	,	I	 not 	 ed 	 	that	since	the	late	1960s	a	growing	number	of	these	 dollar 	 s 	 	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 leav 	 ing 	 	the	 Unit 	 ed 	 	 Stat 	 es 	 	,	never	to	come	back	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	 we 	 re 	 	money	taken	out	in	 suit 	 case 	 s 	 	or	in	 contain 	 ers 	 	,	in	cash	of	course	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	 we 	 re 	 	money	taken	out	by	 criminal 	 s 	 	and	money	 launder 	 ers 	 	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	 we 	 re 	 	money	taken	out	to	fund	the	growth	of	the	terror	,	 il 	 legal 	 	and	criminal	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
So	,	you	see	,	what	is	the	relationship	?
The	 Unit 	 ed 	 	 Stat 	 es 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	is	a	country	that	is	the	 re 	 serve 	 	 curr 	 ency 	 	of	the	world	.
What	 do 	 es 	 	it	mean	?	That	 mean 	 s 	 	that	it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	privilege	that	other	 count 	 ries 	 	do	not	have	.
It	can	borrow	against	the	total	amount	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	in	 circul 	 ation 	 	in	the	world	.
 Th 	 is 	 	privilege	is	 call 	 ed 	 	 seignio 	 rage 	 	.
No	other	country	can	do	that	.
All	the	other	 count 	 ries 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	the	 Unit 	 ed 	 	 K 	 ing 	 dom 	 	,	can	borrow	 on 	 ly 	 	against	the	amount	of	money	in	 circul 	 ation 	 	 in 	 side 	 	 it 	 s 	 	own	 border 	 s 	 	.
So	,	here	is	the	 implic 	 ation 	 	of	the	relationship	between	the	 world 	 s 	 	of	crime	,	terror	,	and	 il 	 legal 	 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	and	our	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
The	U.S.	in	the	1990s	was	 borrow 	 ing 	 	against	the	growth	of	the	terror	,	 il 	 legal 	 	and	criminal	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	how	close	we	are	with	 th 	 is 	 	world	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	 change 	 d 	 	,	of	course	,	after	9-11	,	 be 	 cause 	 	George	Bush	 launch 	 ed 	 	the	War	on	Terror	.
Part	of	the	War	on	Terror	was	the	 introduc 	 tion 	 	of	the	 Pat 	 riot 	 	Act	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	know	that	the	 Pat 	 riot 	 	Act	is	a	 legisl 	 ation 	 	that	 great 	 ly 	 	 reduc 	 es 	 	the	 liber 	 ties 	 	of	 American 	 s 	 	in	order	to	protect	them	against	 terror 	 ism 	 	.
But	there	is	a	section	of	the	 Pat 	 riot 	 	Act	which	 refer 	 s 	 	 specific 	 ally 	 	to	finance	.
And	it	is	,	in	fact	,	an	 anti 	 - 	 money 	 - 	 launder 	 ing 	 	 legisl 	 ation 	 	.
What	the	 Pat 	 riot 	 	Act	did	was	to	prohibit	U.S.	bank	,	and	 U.S. 	 - 	 register 	 ed 	 	foreign	 bank 	 s 	 	from	 do 	 ing 	 	any	 business 	 es 	 	with	 off 	 - 	 shore 	 	 facil 	 ities 	 	.
It	closed	that	door	between	the	money	 launder 	 ing 	 	in	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	and	the	U.S.	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
It	 al 	 so 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	the	U.S.	 mon 	 et 	 ary 	 	 author 	 ities 	 	the	right	to	monitor	any	dollar	 trans 	 action 	 	taking	place	 any 	 where 	 	in	the	world	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	you	can	imagine	what	was	the	 re 	 action 	 	of	the	 inter 	 national 	 	finance	and	 bank 	 ing 	 	.
All	the	 bank 	 ers 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 client 	 s 	 	,	``	Get	out	of	the	 dollar 	 s 	 	and	go	and	invest	 some 	 where 	 	else	.	''
 N 	 ow 	 	,	the	Euro	was	a	 new 	 ly 	 	born	 curr 	 ency 	 	of	great	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	for	business	,	and	,	of	course	,	for	 invest 	 ment 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	people	did	.
 No 	 body 	 	 want 	 s 	 	the	U.S.	 mon 	 et 	 ary 	 	 author 	 ity 	 	to	check	 the 	 ir 	 	relationship	,	to	monitor	 the 	 ir 	 	relationship	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 client 	 ele 	 	.
The	same	thing	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	of	course	,	in	the	world	of	crime	and	terror	.
People	 simpl 	 y 	 	 move 	 d 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 money 	 - 	 launder 	 ing 	 	 activ 	 ities 	 	away	from	the	 Unit 	 ed 	 	 Stat 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 Euro 	 pe 	 	.
Why	did	 th 	 is 	 	happen	?	 Th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 Pat 	 riot 	 	Act	was	a	 uni 	 lateral 	 	 legisl 	 ation 	 	.
It	was	 introduc 	 ed 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	in	the	 Unit 	 ed 	 	 Stat 	 es 	 	.
And	it	was	 introduc 	 ed 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	for	the	U.S.	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
In	 Euro 	 pe 	 	,	a	similar	 legisl 	 ation 	 	was	not	 introduc 	 ed 	 	.
So	,	 with 	 in 	 	six	 month 	 s 	 	 Euro 	 pe 	 	 be 	 came 	 	the	 epi 	 center 	 	of	the	 money 	 - 	 launder 	 ing 	 	 activ 	 ities 	 	of	the	world	.
So	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	 in 	 credible 	 	are	the	relationship	between	the	world	of	crime	and	the	world	of	terror	,	and	our	own	life	.
So	,	why	did	I	tell	you	 th 	 is 	 	story	?
I	told	you	 th 	 is 	 	story	 be 	 cause 	 	you	must	understand	that	there	is	a	world	that	 go 	 es 	 	well	beyond	the	 head 	 lines 	 	of	the	 news 	 paper 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	the	personal	relationship	that	you	have	with	 friend 	 s 	 	and	family	.
You	got	to	question	 every 	 thing 	 	that	is	told	to	you	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	what	I	just	told	you	 to 	 day 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	for	you	to	step	 in 	 to 	 	the	dark	side	,	and	have	a	look	at	it	.
And	 believ 	 e 	 	me	,	it	's	going	to	be	 scar 	 y 	 	.
It	's	going	to	be	 f 	 right 	 ful 	 	,	but	it	's	going	to	enlighten	you	.
And	,	above	all	,	it	's	not	going	to	be	 bor 	 ing 	 	.
Hi	,	my	name	is	 Ro 	 z 	 	 Sav 	 age 	 	and	I	row	 a 	 cross 	 	 ocean 	 s 	 	.
Four	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	I	 row 	 ed 	 	 s 	 olo 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	Atlantic	,	and	since	then	,	I	've	 d 	 one 	 	two	out	of	three	 stage 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	Pacific	,	from	San	 Francis 	 co 	 	to	 Hawa 	 ii 	 	and	from	 Hawa 	 ii 	 	to	 Kir 	 ibati 	 	.
And	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	,	I	'll	be	 leav 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	boat	to	fly	back	to	 Kir 	 ibati 	 	to	 continu 	 e 	 	with	the	third	and	final	stage	of	my	row	 a 	 cross 	 	the	Pacific	.
 Cumulat 	 ively 	 	,	I	will	have	 row 	 ed 	 	over	8,000	 mile 	 s 	 	,	taken	over	three	million	oar	 stroke 	 s 	 	and	 s 	 pent 	 	more	than	312	 day 	 s 	 	 al 	 one 	 	on	the	ocean	on	a	23	foot	 row 	 boat 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 give 	 n 	 	me	a	 ver 	 y 	 	special	relationship	with	the	ocean	.
We	have	a	bit	of	a	 love 	 / 	 hate 	 	thing	going	on	.
I	feel	a	bit	about	it	like	I	did	about	a	 ver 	 y 	 	strict	math	teacher	that	I	once	had	at	school	.
I	did	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	like	her	,	but	I	did	respect	her	,	and	she	taught	me	a	heck	of	a	lot	.
So	 to 	 day 	 	I	'd	like	to	share	with	you	some	of	my	ocean	 adventure 	 s 	 	and	tell	you	a	little	bit	about	what	they	've	taught	me	,	and	how	I	think	we	can	 may 	 be 	 	take	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	and	 app 	 ly 	 	them	to	 th 	 is 	 	 environment 	 al 	 	 challeng 	 e 	 	that	we	face	right	now	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	some	of	you	might	be	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	 Hol 	 d 	 	on	a	minute	.	She	 do 	 es 	 	n't	look	 ver 	 y 	 	much	like	an	ocean	 row 	 er 	 	.
 I 	 s 	 	n't	she	 me 	 ant 	 	to	be	about	 th 	 is 	 	tall	and	about	 th 	 is 	 	wide	and	 may 	 be 	 	look	a	bit	more	like	these	 guy 	 s 	 	?	''
You	'll	notice	,	they	've	all	got	 some 	 thing 	 	that	I	do	n't	.
Well	,	I	do	n't	know	what	you	're	 think 	 ing 	 	,	but	I	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	 beard 	 s 	 	.
And	no	matter	how	long	I	've	 s 	 pent 	 	on	the	ocean	,	I	have	n't	yet	 manage 	 d 	 	to	 must 	 er 	 	a	 de 	 cent 	 	beard	,	and	I	hope	that	it	 remain 	 s 	 	that	way	.
For	a	long	time	,	I	did	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	that	I	could	have	a	big	adventure	.
The	story	that	I	told	 my 	 self 	 	was	that	 adventure 	 rs 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
I	did	n't	look	the	part	.
I	thought	there	 we 	 re 	 	them	and	there	 we 	 re 	 	us	,	and	I	was	not	one	of	them	.
So	for	11	 year 	 s 	 	,	I	 conform 	 ed 	 	.
I	did	what	people	from	my	kind	of	 back 	 ground 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	do	.
I	was	 work 	 ing 	 	in	an	 off 	 ice 	 	in	London	 a 	 s 	 	a	management	 consult 	 ant 	 	.
And	I	think	I	 k 	 new 	 	from	day	one	that	it	was	n't	the	right	job	for	me	.
But	that	kind	of	 condition 	 ing 	 	just	 ke 	 pt 	 	me	there	for	so	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	,	 un 	 til 	 	I	 reach 	 ed 	 	my	 mid 	 - 	 30 	 s 	 	and	I	thought	,	``	You	know	,	I	'm	not	 get 	 ting 	 	any	 young 	 er 	 	.
I	feel	like	I	've	got	a	purpose	in	 th 	 is 	 	life	,	and	I	do	n't	know	what	it	is	,	but	I	'm	 pre 	 tty 	 	certain	that	management	 consult 	 ancy 	 	is	not	it	.
So	,	fast	forward	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	.
I	'd	gone	through	some	 change 	 s 	 	.
To	try	and	answer	that	question	of	,	``	What	am	I	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	 do 	 ing 	 	with	my	life	?	''
I	 s 	 at 	 	down	one	day	and	wrote	two	 version 	 s 	 	of	my	own	 o 	 bit 	 uary 	 	,	the	one	that	I	 want 	 ed 	 	,	a	life	of	adventure	,	and	the	one	that	I	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 head 	 ing 	 	for	which	was	a	nice	,	normal	,	 pleas 	 ant 	 	life	,	but	it	was	n't	where	I	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	by	the	end	of	my	life	.
I	 want 	 ed 	 	to	live	a	life	that	I	could	be	proud	of	.
And	I	remember	looking	at	these	two	 version 	 s 	 	of	my	 o 	 bit 	 uary 	 	and	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	Oh	boy	,	I	'm	on	 total 	 ly 	 	the	wrong	track	here	.
If	I	carry	on	living	 a 	 s 	 	I	am	now	,	I	'm	just	not	going	to	end	up	where	I	want	to	be	in	five	 year 	 s 	 	,	or	10	 year 	 s 	 	,	or	at	the	end	of	my	life	.	''
I	made	a	few	 change 	 s 	 	,	let	go	of	some	loose	 trapping 	 s 	 	of	my	old	life	,	and	through	a	bit	of	a	leap	of	logic	,	 decide 	 d 	 	to	row	 a 	 cross 	 	the	Atlantic	Ocean	.
The	Atlantic	 Row 	 ing 	 	 Ra 	 ce 	 	 run 	 s 	 	from	the	 Can 	 aries 	 	to	 Anti 	 gua 	 	,	it	's	about	3,000	 mile 	 s 	 	,	and	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	to	be	the	 hard 	 est 	 	thing	I	had	ever	 d 	 one 	 	.
 Su 	 re 	 	,	I	had	 want 	 ed 	 	to	get	 out 	 side 	 	of	my	comfort	zone	,	but	what	I	'd	sort	of	 fail 	 ed 	 	to	notice	was	that	 get 	 ting 	 	out	of	your	comfort	zone	is	,	by	definition	,	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 un 	 comfort 	 able 	 	.
And	my	 tim 	 ing 	 	was	not	great	either	:	2005	,	when	I	did	the	Atlantic	,	was	the	year	of	 Hur 	 ric 	 ane 	 	Katrina	.
There	 we 	 re 	 	more	 tropic 	 al 	 	 storm 	 s 	 	in	the	North	Atlantic	than	ever	before	,	since	 record 	 s 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	.
And	 pre 	 tty 	 	early	on	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 storm 	 s 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	making	 the 	 ir 	 	presence	known	.
All	four	of	my	 oar 	 s 	 	broke	before	I	 reach 	 ed 	 	 half 	 way 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	.
 O 	 ar 	 s 	 	are	not	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	look	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
But	what	can	you	do	?	You	're	in	the	middle	of	the	ocean	.
 O 	 ar 	 s 	 	are	your	 on 	 ly 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	of	 pro 	 pulsion 	 	.
So	I	just	had	to	look	around	the	boat	and	figure	out	what	I	was	going	to	use	to	fix	up	these	 oar 	 s 	 	so	that	I	could	carry	on	.
So	I	found	a	boat	hook	and	my	 trust 	 y 	 	duct	tape	and	 splint 	 er 	 ed 	 	the	boat	hook	to	the	 oar 	 s 	 	to	reinforce	it	.
 Th 	 en 	 	,	when	that	 g 	 ave 	 	out	,	I	 saw 	 ed 	 	the	wheel	 axle 	 s 	 	off	my	spare	 row 	 ing 	 	seat	and	used	 t 	 hose 	 	.
And	then	when	 t 	 hose 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	out	,	I	 cannibal 	 ized 	 	one	of	the	broken	 oar 	 s 	 	.
I	'd	never	 be 	 en 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	good	at	 fix 	 ing 	 	stuff	when	I	was	living	my	old	life	,	but	it	's	 amaz 	 ing 	 	how	 resource 	 ful 	 	you	can	 be 	 come 	 	when	you	're	in	the	middle	of	the	ocean	and	there	's	 on 	 ly 	 	one	way	to	get	to	the	other	side	.
And	the	 oar 	 s 	 	kind	of	 be 	 came 	 	a	symbol	of	just	in	how	 man 	 y 	 	ways	I	went	beyond	what	I	thought	 we 	 re 	 	my	 limit 	 s 	 	.
I	 suffer 	 ed 	 	from	 tend 	 initi 	 s 	 	on	my	 shoulder 	 s 	 	and	 salt 	 water 	 	 sore 	 s 	 	on	my	bottom	.
I	 re 	 ally 	 	 struggle 	 d 	 	 psycho 	 logically 	 	,	 total 	 ly 	 	 overwhelm 	 ed 	 	by	the	scale	of	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	,	 real 	 izing 	 	that	,	if	I	carried	on	moving	at	two	 mile 	 s 	 	an	hour	,	3,000	 mile 	 s 	 	was	going	to	take	me	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	long	time	.
There	 we 	 re 	 	so	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	when	I	thought	I	'd	hit	that	limit	,	but	had	no	choice	but	to	just	carry	on	and	try	and	figure	out	how	I	was	going	to	get	to	the	other	side	 with 	 out 	 	 driv 	 ing 	 	 my 	 self 	 	crazy	.
And	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	after	103	 day 	 s 	 	at	sea	,	I	 arriv 	 ed 	 	in	 Anti 	 gua 	 	.
I	do	n't	think	I	've	ever	felt	so	happy	in	my	entire	life	.
It	was	a	bit	like	 finish 	 ing 	 	a	marathon	and	 get 	 ting 	 	out	of	 so 	 lit 	 ary 	 	 con 	 fine 	 ment 	 	and	winning	an	Oscar	all	 roll 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	one	.
I	was	euphoric	.
And	to	see	all	the	people	coming	out	to	greet	me	and	 stand 	 ing 	 	 a 	 long 	 	the	cliff	 top 	 s 	 	and	 clap 	 ping 	 	and	 cheer 	 ing 	 	,	I	just	felt	like	a	movie	star	.
It	was	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	.
And	I	 re 	 ally 	 	 learn 	 ed 	 	then	that	,	the	 big 	 ger 	 	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	,	the	 big 	 ger 	 	the	sense	of	 achiev 	 ement 	 	when	you	get	to	the	end	of	it	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	might	be	a	good	moment	to	take	a	quick	 time 	 - 	 out 	 	to	answer	a	few	 FA 	 Q 	 s 	 	about	ocean	 row 	 ing 	 	that	might	be	going	through	your	mind	.
 Num 	 ber 	 	one	that	I	get	 ask 	 ed 	 	:	What	do	you	eat	?
A	few	 freeze 	 - 	 dried 	 	 meal 	 s 	 	,	but	 most 	 ly 	 	I	try	and	eat	much	more	 un 	 process 	 ed 	 	 food 	 s 	 	.
So	I	grow	my	own	 bean 	 sprout 	 s 	 	.
I	eat	 fruit 	 s 	 	and	nut	 bar 	 s 	 	,	a	lot	of	nuts	.
And	 general 	 ly 	 	 arriv 	 e 	 	about	30	 pound 	 s 	 	 light 	 er 	 	at	the	other	end	.
 Quest 	 ion 	 	number	two	:	How	do	you	sleep	?
With	my	 eye 	 s 	 	shut	.	 Ha 	 - 	 ha 	 	.
I	suppose	what	you	mean	is	:	What	 happen 	 s 	 	to	the	boat	while	I	'm	 sleep 	 ing 	 	?
Well	,	I	plan	my	route	so	that	I	'm	 drift 	 ing 	 	with	the	 wind 	 s 	 	and	the	 current 	 s 	 	while	I	'm	 sleep 	 ing 	 	.
On	a	good	night	,	I	think	my	best	ever	was	11	 mile 	 s 	 	in	the	right	direction	.
Worst	ever	,	13	 mile 	 s 	 	in	the	wrong	direction	.
That	's	a	bad	day	at	the	 off 	 ice 	 	.
What	do	I	wear	?
 Mo 	 st 	 ly 	 	,	a	 base 	 ball 	 	cap	,	 row 	 ing 	 	 glove 	 s 	 	and	a	 s 	 mile 	 	--	or	a	frown	,	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	 whet 	 her 	 	I	went	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	 over 	 night 	 	--	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 s 	 un 	 	 lot 	 ion 	 	.
Do	I	have	a	chase	boat	?
No	I	do	n't	.	I	'm	 total 	 ly 	 	 self 	 - 	 support 	 ing 	 	out	there	.
I	do	n't	see	 any 	 body 	 	for	the	whole	time	that	I	'm	at	sea	,	 general 	 ly 	 	.
And	 final 	 ly 	 	:	Am	I	crazy	?
Well	,	I	 leav 	 e 	 	that	one	up	to	you	to	 judg 	 e 	 	.
So	,	how	do	you	top	 row 	 ing 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	Atlantic	?
Well	,	 natural 	 ly 	 	,	you	decide	to	row	 a 	 cross 	 	the	Pacific	.
Well	,	I	thought	the	Atlantic	was	big	,	but	the	Pacific	is	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	big	.
I	think	we	tend	to	do	it	a	little	bit	of	a	 dis 	 service 	 	in	our	usual	 map 	 s 	 	.
I	do	n't	know	for	 s 	 ure 	 	that	the	 Brit 	 s 	 	 invent 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	view	of	the	world	,	but	I	suspect	we	might	have	 d 	 one 	 	so	:	we	are	right	in	the	middle	,	and	we	've	cut	the	Pacific	in	half	and	 f 	 lung 	 	it	to	the	far	 corner 	 s 	 	of	the	world	.
 Where 	 a 	 s 	 	if	you	look	in	Google	Earth	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	the	Pacific	 look 	 s 	 	.
It	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 cover 	 s 	 	half	the	planet	.
You	can	just	see	a	little	bit	of	North	America	up	here	and	a	 s 	 liver 	 	of	Australia	down	there	.
It	is	 re 	 ally 	 	big	--	65	million	square	 mile 	 s 	 	--	and	to	row	in	a	straight	line	 a 	 cross 	 	it	would	be	about	8,000	 mile 	 s 	 	.
 Un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	ocean	 row 	 boat 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 rare 	 ly 	 	go	in	a	straight	line	.
By	the	time	I	get	to	Australia	,	if	I	get	to	Australia	,	I	will	have	 row 	 ed 	 	 prob 	 ably 	 	nine	or	10,000	 mile 	 s 	 	in	all	.
So	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 no 	 body 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	straight	mind	would	row	straight	past	 Hawa 	 ii 	 	 with 	 out 	 	dropping	in	,	I	 decide 	 d 	 	to	cut	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	big	 under 	 taking 	 	 in 	 to 	 	three	 segment 	 s 	 	.
The	first	attempt	did	n't	go	so	well	.
In	2007	,	I	did	a	 ra 	 ther 	 	 in 	 voluntary 	 	 cap 	 s 	 ize 	 	drill	three	 time 	 s 	 	in	24	 hour 	 s 	 	.
A	bit	like	 be 	 ing 	 	in	a	 wash 	 ing 	 	machine	.
 Bo 	 at 	 	got	a	bit	 d 	 ing 	 ed 	 	up	,	so	did	I	.
I	 blog 	 ged 	 	about	it	.	 Un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	 some 	 body 	 	with	a	bit	of	a	hero	complex	 decide 	 d 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	 dam 	 s 	 el 	 	was	in	 di 	 stress 	 	and	 need 	 ed 	 	saving	.
The	first	I	 k 	 new 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	was	when	the	Coast	Guard	plane	 turn 	 ed 	 	up	 over 	 head 	 	.
I	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	tell	them	to	go	away	.
We	had	a	bit	of	a	battle	of	 will 	 s 	 	.
I	lost	and	got	 air 	 lift 	 ed 	 	.
 Aw 	 ful 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	awful	.
It	was	one	of	the	worst	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	my	life	,	 a 	 s 	 	I	was	 lift 	 ed 	 	up	on	that	 win 	 ch 	 	line	 in 	 to 	 	the	helicopter	and	 look 	 ed 	 	down	at	my	 trust 	 y 	 	little	boat	 roll 	 ing 	 	around	in	the	20	foot	 wave 	 s 	 	and	 wonder 	 ing 	 	if	I	would	ever	see	her	 aga 	 in 	 	.
So	I	had	to	launch	a	 ver 	 y 	 	expensive	salvage	operation	and	then	wait	 an 	 other 	 	nine	 month 	 s 	 	before	I	could	get	back	out	onto	the	ocean	 aga 	 in 	 	.
But	what	do	you	do	?
Fall	down	nine	 time 	 s 	 	,	get	up	10	.
So	,	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	year	,	I	set	out	and	,	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	time	made	it	 safe 	 ly 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	to	 Hawa 	 ii 	 	.
But	it	was	not	 with 	 out 	 	 mis 	 adventure 	 	.
My	 water 	 maker 	 	broke	,	 on 	 ly 	 	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	piece	of	kit	that	I	have	on	the	boat	.
 Power 	 ed 	 	by	my	solar	 pan 	 el 	 s 	 	,	it	 suck 	 s 	 	in	 salt 	 water 	 	and	 turn 	 s 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	 fresh 	 water 	 	.
But	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	react	 ver 	 y 	 	well	to	 be 	 ing 	 	 immers 	 ed 	 	in	ocean	,	which	is	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	it	.
 Fort 	 un 	 ate 	 ly 	 	,	help	was	at	hand	.
There	was	 an 	 other 	 	 un 	 usual 	 	boat	out	there	at	the	same	time	,	 do 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	I	was	 do 	 ing 	 	,	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	 aware 	 ness 	 	to	the	North	Pacific	 Gar 	 bag 	 e 	 	 Pat 	 ch 	 	,	that	area	in	the	North	Pacific	about	twice	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	Texas	,	with	an	 estimate 	 d 	 	3.5	million	 ton 	 s 	 	of	trash	in	it	,	 circul 	 ating 	 	at	the	center	of	that	North	Pacific	Gyre	.
So	,	to	make	the	point	,	these	 guy 	 s 	 	had	 actual 	 ly 	 	built	 the 	 ir 	 	boat	out	of	plastic	trash	,	15,000	empty	water	 bottle 	 s 	 	 latch 	 ed 	 	together	 in 	 to 	 	two	 pontoon 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	 we 	 re 	 	going	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	.
 Part 	 ly 	 	,	they	'd	had	a	bit	of	a	delay	.
 The 	 y 	 	'd	had	to	pull	in	at	 Cata 	 lina 	 	Island	 short 	 ly 	 	after	they	left	Long	 Be 	 ach 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	lids	of	all	the	water	 bottle 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	coming	 un 	 d 	 one 	 	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 start 	 ing 	 	to	sink	.
So	they	'd	had	to	pull	in	and	do	all	the	lids	up	.
But	,	 a 	 s 	 	I	was	 approach 	 ing 	 	the	end	of	my	water	 re 	 serve 	 s 	 	,	 luck 	 ily 	 	,	our	 course 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 converg 	 ing 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	 we 	 re 	 	running	out	of	food	;	I	was	running	out	of	water	.
So	we	 lia 	 is 	 ed 	 	by	satellite	phone	and	 arrange 	 d 	 	to	meet	up	.
And	it	took	about	a	week	for	us	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	 gradu 	 ally 	 	 converg 	 e 	 	.
I	was	 do 	 ing 	 	a	 pathetic 	 ally 	 	 s 	 low 	 	speed	of	about	1.3	 knot 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	 marginal 	 ly 	 	less	pathetic	speed	of	about	1.4	:	it	was	like	two	 s 	 nail 	 s 	 	in	a	 mat 	 ing 	 	dance	.
But	,	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	we	did	manage	to	meet	up	and	 Jo 	 el 	 	hopped	 over 	 board 	 	,	caught	us	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	big	 mahi 	 - 	 mahi 	 	,	which	was	the	best	food	I	'd	had	in	,	ooh	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	three	 month 	 s 	 	.
 Fort 	 un 	 ate 	 ly 	 	,	the	one	that	he	caught	that	day	was	better	than	 th 	 is 	 	one	they	caught	a	few	 week 	 s 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	.
When	they	 open 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	one	up	,	they	found	 it 	 s 	 	stomach	was	full	of	plastic	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	news	 be 	 cause 	 	plastic	is	not	an	 in 	 ert 	 	 sub 	 stance 	 	.
It	 le 	 ache 	 s 	 	out	 chemical 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 fl 	 esh 	 	of	the	poor	critter	that	ate	it	,	and	then	we	come	 a 	 long 	 	and	eat	that	poor	critter	,	and	we	get	some	of	the	 toxin 	 s 	 	 accumul 	 ating 	 	in	our	bodies	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
So	there	are	 ver 	 y 	 	real	 implic 	 ations 	 	for	human	health	.
I	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	made	it	to	 Hawa 	 ii 	 	still	 al 	 ive 	 	.
And	,	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	year	,	set	out	on	the	second	stage	of	the	Pacific	,	from	 Hawa 	 ii 	 	down	to	 Tar 	 awa 	 	.
And	you	'll	notice	 some 	 thing 	 	about	 Tar 	 awa 	 	;	it	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 low 	 - 	 ly 	 ing 	 	.
It	's	that	little	green	 s 	 liver 	 	on	the	horizon	,	which	 make 	 s 	 	them	 ver 	 y 	 	nervous	about	 ris 	 ing 	 	 ocean 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	big	trouble	for	these	 guy 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	've	got	no	 point 	 s 	 	of	land	more	than	about	six	feet	above	sea	level	.
And	 al 	 so 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	an	 in 	 crease 	 	in	 extrem 	 e 	 	weather	 event 	 s 	 	due	to	climate	change	,	they	're	 expect 	 ing 	 	more	 wave 	 s 	 	to	come	in	over	the	 fr 	 ing 	 ing 	 	reef	,	which	will	 contami 	 n 	 ate 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	fresh	water	supply	.
I	had	a	 meet 	 ing 	 	with	the	 p 	 resident 	 	there	,	who	told	me	about	his	exit	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	for	his	country	.
He	 expect 	 s 	 	that	 with 	 in 	 	the	next	50	 year 	 s 	 	,	the	100,000	people	that	live	there	will	have	to	 re 	 locate 	 	to	New	Zealand	or	Australia	.
And	that	made	me	think	about	how	would	I	feel	if	 Brit 	 ain 	 	was	going	to	disappear	under	the	 wave 	 s 	 	;	if	the	 place 	 s 	 	where	I	'd	 be 	 en 	 	born	and	gone	to	school	and	got	married	,	if	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 place 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	just	going	to	disappear	 fore 	 ver 	 	.
How	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	 un 	 ground 	 ed 	 	that	would	make	me	feel	.
 Ver 	 y 	 	 short 	 ly 	 	,	I	'll	be	setting	out	to	try	and	get	to	Australia	,	and	if	I	'm	 success 	 ful 	 	,	I	'll	be	the	first	woman	ever	to	row	 s 	 olo 	 	all	the	way	 a 	 cross 	 	the	Pacific	.
And	I	try	to	use	 th 	 is 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	 aware 	 ness 	 	to	these	 environment 	 al 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	,	to	 br 	 ing 	 	a	human	face	to	the	ocean	.
If	the	Atlantic	was	about	my	inner	journey	,	 discover 	 ing 	 	my	own	 cap 	 abilities 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	the	Pacific	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	about	my	 out 	 er 	 	journey	,	 figur 	 ing 	 	out	how	I	can	use	my	 interest 	 ing 	 	 care 	 er 	 	choice	to	be	of	service	to	the	world	,	and	to	take	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	I	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	out	there	and	 app 	 ly 	 	them	to	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	that	 human 	 kind 	 	now	 find 	 s 	 	 it 	 self 	 	in	.
I	think	there	are	 prob 	 ably 	 	three	key	 point 	 s 	 	here	.
The	first	one	is	about	the	 st 	 ories 	 	that	we	tell	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
For	so	long	,	I	told	 my 	 self 	 	that	I	could	n't	have	an	adventure	 be 	 cause 	 	I	was	n't	six	foot	tall	and	athletic	and	 beard 	 ed 	 	.
And	then	that	story	 change 	 d 	 	.
I	found	out	that	people	had	 row 	 ed 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	 ocean 	 s 	 	.
I	even	met	one	of	them	and	she	was	just	about	my	 s 	 ize 	 	.
So	even	 th 	 ough 	 	I	did	n't	grow	any	 tall 	 er 	 	,	I	did	n't	sprout	a	beard	,	 some 	 thing 	 	had	 change 	 d 	 	:	My	 in 	 terior 	 	 dial 	 ogue 	 	had	 change 	 d 	 	.
At	the	moment	,	the	story	that	we	 collect 	 ively 	 	tell	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	is	that	we	need	all	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	,	that	we	need	oil	.
But	what	about	if	we	just	change	that	story	?
We	do	have	 alter 	 native 	 s 	 	,	and	we	have	the	power	of	free	will	to	 choos 	 e 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 alter 	 native 	 s 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 sustain 	 able 	 	 one 	 s 	 	,	to	create	a	 green 	 er 	 	future	.
The	second	point	is	about	the	 accumul 	 ation 	 	of	 tin 	 y 	 	 action 	 s 	 	.
We	might	think	that	 any 	 thing 	 	that	we	do	 a 	 s 	 	an	individual	is	just	a	drop	in	the	ocean	,	that	it	ca	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	make	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
But	it	 do 	 es 	 	.	 Gen 	 er 	 ally 	 	,	we	have	n't	got	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	mess	through	big	 disaster 	 s 	 	.
Yes	,	there	have	 be 	 en 	 	the	 Ex 	 x 	 on 	 	 Valdez 	 es 	 	and	the	 Chernobyl 	 s 	 	,	but	 most 	 ly 	 	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	an	 accumul 	 ation 	 	of	bad	 decision 	 s 	 	by	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 individual 	 s 	 	,	day	after	day	and	year	after	year	.
And	,	by	the	same	 to 	 ken 	 	,	we	can	turn	that	tide	.
We	can	start	making	better	,	 wis 	 er 	 	,	more	 sustain 	 able 	 	 decision 	 s 	 	.
And	when	we	do	that	,	we	're	not	just	one	person	.
 Any 	 thing 	 	that	we	do	 spread 	 s 	 	 ripple 	 s 	 	.
Other	people	will	see	if	you	're	in	the	 super 	 market 	 	line	and	you	pull	out	your	 re 	 us 	 able 	 	 grocer 	 y 	 	bag	.
 May 	 be 	 	if	we	all	start	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	can	make	it	 social 	 ly 	 	 un 	 accept 	 able 	 	to	say	 y 	 es 	 	to	plastic	in	the	 check 	 out 	 	line	.
That	's	just	one	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	 world 	 - 	 wide 	 	community	.
The	other	point	:	It	's	about	taking	 respons 	 ibility 	 	.
For	so	much	of	my	life	,	I	 want 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	else	to	make	me	happy	.
I	thought	if	I	had	the	right	house	or	the	right	car	or	the	right	man	in	my	life	,	then	I	could	be	happy	.
But	when	I	wrote	that	 o 	 bit 	 uary 	 	 exercis 	 e 	 	,	I	 actual 	 ly 	 	grew	up	a	little	bit	in	that	moment	and	 real 	 ized 	 	that	I	 need 	 ed 	 	to	create	my	own	future	.
I	could	n't	just	wait	 pass 	 ively 	 	for	happiness	to	come	and	find	me	.
And	I	suppose	I	'm	a	 self 	 ish 	 	 environment 	 alist 	 	.
I	plan	on	 be 	 ing 	 	around	for	a	long	time	,	and	when	I	'm	90	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	I	want	to	be	happy	and	 health 	 y 	 	.
And	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	to	be	happy	on	a	planet	that	's	 rack 	 ed 	 	with	famine	and	drought	.
It	's	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	to	be	 health 	 y 	 	on	a	planet	where	we	've	 poison 	 ed 	 	the	earth	and	the	sea	and	the	air	.
So	,	 short 	 ly 	 	,	I	'm	going	to	be	 launch 	 ing 	 	a	new	 initi 	 ative 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 Eco 	 - 	 Hero 	 es 	 	.
And	the	idea	here	is	that	all	our	 Eco 	 - 	 Hero 	 es 	 	will	log	at	 l 	 east 	 	one	green	 de 	 ed 	 	every	day	.
It	's	 me 	 ant 	 	to	be	a	bit	of	a	game	.
We	're	going	to	make	an	 i 	 Phone 	 	app	out	of	it	.
We	just	want	to	try	and	create	that	 aware 	 ness 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 s 	 ure 	 	,	changing	a	light	bulb	is	n't	going	to	change	the	world	,	but	that	attitude	,	that	 aware 	 ness 	 	that	 lead 	 s 	 	you	to	change	the	light	bulb	or	take	your	 re 	 us 	 able 	 	coffee	mug	,	that	is	what	could	change	the	world	.
I	 re 	 ally 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	that	we	stand	at	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	point	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
We	have	a	choice	.	We	've	 be 	 en 	 	 bless 	 ed 	 	,	or	 cur 	 s 	 ed 	 	,	with	free	will	.
We	can	 choos 	 e 	 	a	 green 	 er 	 	future	,	and	we	can	get	there	if	we	all	pull	together	to	take	it	one	stroke	at	a	time	.

To	be	new	at	TED	--	it	's	like	 be 	 ing 	 	the	last	 high 	 - 	 school 	 	virgin	.
You	know	that	all	of	the	cool	people	are	--	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
And	you	're	on	the	 out 	 side 	 	,	you	're	at	home	.
You	're	like	the	 Ra 	 s 	 py 	 ni 	 	 Brother 	 s 	 	,	where	you	've	got	your	 ball 	 s 	 	in	cold	water	.	And	--	--	you	just	play	with	your	 finger 	 s 	 	all	day	.	And	then	you	get	 invit 	 ed 	 	.
And	you	're	on	the	 in 	 side 	 	,	and	it	's	 every 	 thing 	 	you	 hop 	 ed 	 	it	would	be	.
It	's	 excit 	 ing 	 	and	there	's	music	 play 	 ing 	 	all	of	the	time	and	then	 sudden 	 ly 	 	it	's	over	.	And	it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	taken	five	 minute 	 s 	 	.
And	you	want	to	go	back	and	do	it	 aga 	 in 	 	.
But	I	 re 	 ally 	 	appreciate	 be 	 ing 	 	here	.	And	thank	you	,	Chris	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	,	thank	you	,	 Deb 	 orah 	 	 Pat 	 ton 	 	,	for	making	 th 	 is 	 	possible	.
So	 any 	 way 	 	,	 to 	 day 	 	we	'll	talk	about	 architect 	 ure 	 	a	little	bit	,	 with 	 in 	 	the	subject	of	creation	and	 optim 	 ism 	 	.
And	if	you	put	creation	and	 optim 	 ism 	 	together	,	you	've	got	two	 choice 	 s 	 	that	you	can	talk	about	.
You	can	talk	about	 creation 	 ism 	 	--	which	I	think	would	n't	go	down	well	with	 th 	 is 	 	audience	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	not	from	a	view	where	you	 we 	 re 	 	a	proponent	of	it	--	or	you	can	talk	about	optimisations	,	 spell 	 ed 	 	the	 Brit 	 ish 	 	way	,	with	an	S	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	a	Z	.
And	I	think	that	's	what	I	'd	like	to	talk	about	 to 	 day 	 	.
But	any	kind	of	conversation	about	 architect 	 ure 	 	--	which	is	,	in	fact	,	what	you	 we 	 re 	 	just	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	,	what	was	going	on	here	,	setting	up	TED	,	 small 	 - 	 scale 	 	 architect 	 ure 	 	--	at	the	present	time	ca	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	happen	 with 	 out 	 	a	conversation	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	the	World	 Tra 	 de 	 	 Cent 	 er 	 	,	and	what	's	 be 	 en 	 	going	on	there	,	what	it	 mean 	 s 	 	to	us	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	if	 architect 	 ure 	 	is	what	I	 believ 	 e 	 	it	to	be	,	which	is	the	built	form	of	our	cultural	 ambit 	 ions 	 	,	what	do	you	do	when	 present 	 ed 	 	with	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	 rect 	 ify 	 	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	that	 represent 	 s 	 	 some 	 body 	 	else	's	cultural	 ambit 	 ions 	 	 relat 	 ive 	 	to	us	?
And	our	own	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	make	 some 	 thing 	 	new	there	?
 Th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 galvan 	 izing 	 	issue	for	a	long	time	.
I	think	that	the	World	 Tra 	 de 	 	 Cent 	 er 	 	in	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	an	 un 	 fortunate 	 	way	,	 br 	 ought 	 	 architect 	 ure 	 	 in 	 to 	 	focus	in	a	way	that	I	do	n't	think	people	had	thought	of	in	a	long	time	,	and	made	it	a	subject	for	common	conversation	.
I	do	n't	remember	,	in	my	20-year	 care 	 er 	 	of	 p 	 rac 	 tic 	 ing 	 	and	writing	about	 architect 	 ure 	 	,	a	time	when	five	people	 s 	 at 	 	me	down	at	a	table	and	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	 ver 	 y 	 	serious	 question 	 s 	 	about	 zon 	 ing 	 	,	fire	 exit 	 ing 	 	,	 safe 	 ty 	 	 concern 	 s 	 	and	 whet 	 her 	 	carpet	 burn 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	just	not	 thing 	 s 	 	we	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	 ver 	 y 	 	often	.
And	yet	,	now	,	it	's	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	all	the	time	.
At	the	point	where	you	can	weaponize	your	 building 	 s 	 	,	you	have	to	 sudden 	 ly 	 	think	about	 architect 	 ure 	 	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	different	way	.
And	so	now	we	're	going	to	think	about	 architect 	 ure 	 	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	different	way	,	we	're	going	to	think	about	it	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
How	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	saw	 US 	 A 	 	 To 	 day 	 	,	 to 	 day 	 	?	There	it	is	.	 Look 	 s 	 	like	that	.
There	's	the	World	 Tra 	 de 	 	 Cent 	 er 	 	 s 	 ite 	 	,	on	the	front	cover	.
 The 	 y 	 	've	made	a	 s 	 election 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	've	 chose 	 n 	 	a	project	by	Daniel	 Lib 	 es 	 kind 	 	,	the	enfant	 terr 	 ible 	 	of	the	moment	of	 architect 	 ure 	 	.
Child-prodigy	piano	player	,	he	 start 	 ed 	 	on	the	squeezebox	,	and	 move 	 d 	 	to	a	little	more	serious	issue	,	a	 big 	 ger 	 	instrument	,	and	now	to	an	even	 large 	 r 	 	instrument	,	 up 	 on 	 	which	to	work	his	 part 	 icular 	 	brand	of	deconstructivist	magic	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	see	here	.
He	was	one	of	six	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	 invit 	 ed 	 	to	 particip 	 ate 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 com 	 petition 	 	,	after	six	previous	 firm 	 s 	 	 s 	 truck 	 	out	with	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	so	stupid	and	 ban 	 al 	 	that	even	the	city	of	New	York	was	 force 	 d 	 	to	go	,	``	Oh	,	I	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	sorry	,	we	 screw 	 ed 	 	up	.	''
Right	.	Can	we	do	 th 	 is 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	from	the	top	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	use	some	people	with	a	vague	hint	of	talent	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	just	six	utter	boobs	like	we	 br 	 ought 	 	in	last	time	,	real	 e 	 state 	 	 hack 	 s 	 	of	the	kind	who	 usual 	 ly 	 	plan	our	cities	.
Let	's	 br 	 ing 	 	in	some	real	 architect 	 s 	 	for	a	change	.
And	so	we	got	 th 	 is 	 	,	or	we	had	a	choice	of	that	.	Oh	,	stop	 clap 	 ping 	 	.
It	's	too	late	.	That	is	gone	.
 Th 	 is 	 	was	a	scheme	by	a	team	 call 	 ed 	 	THINK	,	a	New	York-based	team	,	and	then	there	was	that	one	,	which	was	the	 Lib 	 es 	 kind 	 	scheme	.
 Th 	 is 	 	one	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	be	the	new	World	 Tra 	 de 	 	 Cent 	 er 	 	:	a	giant	hole	in	the	ground	with	big	 building 	 s 	 	 fall 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	it	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	I	do	n't	know	what	you	think	,	but	I	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	stupid	decision	,	 be 	 cause 	 	what	you	've	 d 	 one 	 	is	just	made	a	permanent	memorial	to	 destruct 	 ion 	 	by	making	it	look	like	the	 destruct 	 ion 	 	is	going	to	 continu 	 e 	 	 fore 	 ver 	 	.
But	that	's	what	we	're	going	to	do	.
But	I	want	you	to	think	about	these	 thing 	 s 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	a	kind	of	 on 	 going 	 	struggle	that	American	 architect 	 ure 	 	 represent 	 s 	 	,	and	that	these	two	 thing 	 s 	 	talk	about	 ver 	 y 	 	 specific 	 ally 	 	.
And	that	is	the	wild	 diverge 	 nce 	 	in	how	we	 choos 	 e 	 	our	 architect 	 s 	 	,	in	 try 	 ing 	 	to	decide	 whet 	 her 	 	we	want	 architect 	 ure 	 	from	the	kind	of	technocratic	solution	to	 every 	 thing 	 	--	that	there	is	a	large	,	technical	answer	that	can	solve	all	 problem 	 s 	 	,	be	they	social	,	be	they	physical	,	be	they	chemical	--	or	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	more	of	a	romantic	solution	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	I	do	n't	mean	romantic	 a 	 s 	 	in	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	nice	place	to	take	 some 	 one 	 	on	a	date	.
I	mean	romantic	in	the	sense	of	,	there	are	 thing 	 s 	 	 large 	 r 	 	and	 grand 	 er 	 	than	us	.
So	,	in	the	American	tradition	,	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	the	technocratic	and	the	romantic	,	would	be	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	 Thom 	 a 	 s 	 	Jefferson	's	Cartesian	 grid 	 s 	 	 spread 	 ing 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 Unit 	 ed 	 	 Stat 	 es 	 	,	that	 give 	 s 	 	us	 bas 	 ically 	 	the	whole	shape	of	every	western	state	in	the	 Unit 	 ed 	 	 Stat 	 es 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 tru 	 ly 	 	,	technocratic	solution	,	a	 bow 	 ing 	 	to	the	--	in	Jefferson	's	time	--	current	,	popular	 philosoph 	 y 	 	of	 rational 	 ism 	 	.
Or	the	way	we	went	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	that	 lat 	 er 	 	:	manifest	 de 	 s 	 tin 	 y 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	which	would	you	 ra 	 ther 	 	be	?	A	grid	,	or	manifest	 de 	 s 	 tin 	 y 	 	?
Manifest	 de 	 s 	 tin 	 y 	 	.
It	's	a	big	deal	.	It	 sound 	 s 	 	big	,	it	 sound 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	it	 sound 	 s 	 	solid	.	It	 sound 	 s 	 	American	.	Ballsy	,	serious	,	male	.
And	that	kind	of	fight	 ha 	 s 	 	gone	on	back	and	forth	in	 architect 	 ure 	 	all	the	time	.
I	mean	,	it	 go 	 es 	 	on	in	our	private	 live 	 s 	 	,	too	,	every	single	day	.
We	all	want	to	go	out	and	buy	an	Audi	 T 	 T 	 	,	do	n't	we	?
 Every 	 one 	 	here	must	own	one	,	or	at	 l 	 east 	 	they	craved	one	the	moment	they	saw	one	.
And	then	they	hopped	in	it	,	 turn 	 ed 	 	the	little	 electron 	 ic 	 	key	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	the	real	key	,	 zip 	 ped 	 	home	on	 the 	 ir 	 	new	superhighway	,	and	drove	straight	 in 	 to 	 	a	 gar 	 age 	 	that	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	 Tu 	 dor 	 	castle	.
Why	?	Why	?	Why	do	you	want	to	do	that	?
Why	do	we	all	want	to	do	that	?	I	even	owned	a	 Tu 	 dor 	 	thing	once	 my 	 self 	 	.
It	's	in	our	nature	to	go	ricocheting	back	and	forth	between	 th 	 is 	 	technocratic	solution	and	a	 large 	 r 	 	,	sort	of	more	romantic	image	of	where	we	are	.
So	we	're	going	to	go	straight	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
Can	I	have	the	 light 	 s 	 	off	for	a	moment	?
I	'm	going	to	talk	about	two	 architect 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 brief 	 ly 	 	that	represent	the	current	split	,	architecturally	,	between	these	two	 tradition 	 s 	 	of	a	technocratic	or	 techno 	 logical 	 	solution	and	a	romantic	solution	.
And	these	are	two	of	the	top	 architect 	 ural 	 	 practice 	 s 	 	in	the	 Unit 	 ed 	 	 Stat 	 es 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
One	 ver 	 y 	 	young	,	one	a	little	more	mature	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	work	of	a	firm	 call 	 ed 	 	SHoP	,	and	what	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	here	,	is	 the 	 ir 	 	 iso 	 metric 	 	 draw 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	what	will	be	a	 large 	 - 	 scale 	 	camera	obscura	in	a	public	park	.
 Do 	 es 	 	 every 	 body 	 	know	what	a	camera	obscura	is	?
Yeah	,	it	's	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	giant	camera	 lens 	 es 	 	that	 take 	 s 	 	a	picture	of	the	 out 	 side 	 	world	--	it	's	sort	of	a	little	movie	,	 with 	 out 	 	any	moving	 part 	 s 	 	--	and	 project 	 s 	 	it	on	a	page	,	and	you	can	see	the	world	 out 	 side 	 	you	 a 	 s 	 	you	walk	around	it	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	just	the	 out 	 line 	 	of	it	,	and	you	can	see	,	 do 	 es 	 	it	look	like	a	regular	building	?	No	.
It	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	non-orthogonal	:	it	's	not	up	and	down	,	square	,	 rect 	 angular 	 	,	 any 	 thing 	 	like	that	,	that	you	'd	see	in	a	normal	shape	of	a	building	.
The	computer	revolution	,	the	technocratic	,	 techno 	 logical 	 	revolution	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 allow 	 ed 	 	us	to	jettison	normal-shaped	 building 	 s 	 	,	 tradition 	 ally 	 	shaped	 building 	 s 	 	,	in	favor	of	non-orthogonal	 building 	 s 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
What	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	about	it	is	not	the	shape	.
What	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	about	it	is	how	it	's	made	.	How	it	's	made	.
A	 brand 	 - 	 new 	 	way	to	put	 building 	 s 	 	together	,	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	mass	 custom 	 ization 	 	.	No	,	it	is	not	an	 oxy 	 moron 	 	.
What	 make 	 s 	 	the	building	expensive	,	in	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	sense	,	is	making	individual	 part 	 s 	 	custom	,	that	you	ca	n't	do	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	.
That	's	why	we	all	live	in	 develop 	 er 	 	 house 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	all	want	to	 s 	 ave 	 	money	by	building	the	same	thing	500	 time 	 s 	 	.
That	's	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 cheap 	 er 	 	.
Mass	 custom 	 ization 	 	 work 	 s 	 	by	an	architect	 feed 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	computer	,	a	program	that	 say 	 s 	 	,	 manufactur 	 e 	 	these	 part 	 s 	 	.
The	computer	then	 talk 	 s 	 	to	a	machine	--	a	computer-operated	machine	,	a	cad-cam	machine	--	that	can	make	a	zillion	different	 change 	 s 	 	,	at	a	moment	's	notice	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	computer	is	just	a	machine	.
It	 do 	 es 	 	n't	care	.	It	's	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	the	 part 	 s 	 	.
It	 do 	 es 	 	n't	see	any	excess	cost	.	It	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 s 	 pend 	 	any	extra	time	.
It	's	not	a	 labor 	 er 	 	--	it	's	 simpl 	 y 	 	an	 electron 	 ic 	 	 la 	 the 	 	,	so	the	 part 	 s 	 	can	all	be	cut	at	the	same	time	.

And	so	what	the	 build 	 er 	 	will	get	is	every	single	individual	part	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	custom	 manufactur 	 ed 	 	off-site	and	 deliver 	 ed 	 	on	a	truck	to	the	 s 	 ite 	 	,	to	that	 build 	 er 	 	,	and	a	set	of	these	 instruct 	 ion 	 	 manual 	 s 	 	.
Just	simple	``	Bolt	A	to	B	''	and	they	will	be	able	to	put	them	together	.
 He 	 re 	 	's	the	little	 draw 	 ing 	 	that	 tell 	 s 	 	them	how	that	 work 	 s 	 	--	and	that	's	what	will	happen	in	the	end	.
You	're	 under 	 neath 	 	it	,	looking	up	 in 	 to 	 	the	lens	of	the	camera	obscura	.
 L 	 est 	 	you	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	all	fiction	,	 l 	 est 	 	you	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	all	 fanta 	 s 	 y 	 	,	or	 rom 	 ance 	 	,	these	same	 architect 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	produce	 some 	 thing 	 	for	the	central	 court 	 yard 	 	of	PS1	,	which	is	a	museum	in	 Brook 	 lyn 	 	,	New	York	,	 a 	 s 	 	part	of	 the 	 ir 	 	young	 architect 	 s 	 	summer	 s 	 eries 	 	.
And	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	well	,	it	's	summer	,	what	do	you	do	?
In	the	summer	,	you	go	to	the	beach	.
And	when	you	go	to	the	beach	,	what	do	you	get	?	You	get	sand	 dune 	 s 	 	.
So	let	's	make	 architect 	 ural 	 	sand	 dune 	 s 	 	and	a	beach	cabana	.
So	they	went	out	and	they	 model 	 ed 	 	a	computer	model	of	a	sand	dune	.
 The 	 y 	 	took	 photograph 	 s 	 	,	they	fed	the	 photograph 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	computer	program	,	and	that	computer	program	shaped	a	sand	dune	and	then	took	that	sand	dune	shape	and	 turn 	 ed 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	--	at	 the 	 ir 	 	 instruct 	 ions 	 	,	using	standard	 soft 	 ware 	 	with	 s 	 light 	 	 mod 	 ification 	 s 	 	--	a	set	of	 instruct 	 ions 	 	for	 piece 	 s 	 	of	wood	.
And	 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	 piece 	 s 	 	of	wood	.	 T 	 hose 	 	are	the	 instruct 	 ions 	 	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	the	 piece 	 s 	 	,	and	here	's	a	little	of	that	blown	up	.
What	you	can	see	is	there	's	about	six	different	 color 	 s 	 	,	and	each	color	 represent 	 s 	 	a	type	of	wood	to	be	cut	,	a	piece	of	wood	to	be	cut	.
All	of	which	 we 	 re 	 	 deliver 	 ed 	 	by	flat	bed	,	on	a	truck	,	and	hand	 assemble 	 d 	 	in	48	 hour 	 s 	 	by	a	team	of	eight	people	,	 on 	 ly 	 	one	of	whom	had	ever	 s 	 een 	 	the	 plan 	 s 	 	before	.

There	are	 on 	 ly 	 	16	different	 piece 	 s 	 	of	wood	,	 on 	 ly 	 	16	different	 assem 	 bly 	 	 part 	 s 	 	here	.

It	's	a	great	place	for	 part 	 ies 	 	--	it	was	,	it	was	 on 	 ly 	 	up	for	six	 week 	 s 	 	.
It	's	got	little	 dress 	 ing 	 	rooms	and	cabanas	,	where	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 interest 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	went	on	,	all	summer	long	.

When	I	was	a	kid	,	I	hid	my	heart	under	the	bed	,	 be 	 cause 	 	my	mother	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	If	you	're	not	 care 	 ful 	 	,	 some 	 day 	 	 some 	 one 	 	's	going	to	break	it	.	''
Take	it	from	me	.	Under	the	bed	is	not	a	good	 hid 	 ing 	 	spot	.

But	that	's	what	we	 we 	 re 	 	told	.
 Stan 	 d 	 	up	for	 your 	 self 	 	.
And	that	's	hard	to	do	if	you	do	n't	know	who	you	are	.
We	 we 	 re 	 	 expect 	 ed 	 	to	define	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	at	 s 	 uch 	 	an	early	age	,	and	if	we	did	n't	do	it	,	 other 	 s 	 	did	it	for	us	.
Geek	.	Fatty	.	Slut	.	Fag	.
And	at	the	same	time	we	 we 	 re 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	told	what	we	 we 	 re 	 	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	,	``	What	do	you	want	to	be	when	you	grow	up	?	''
I	 al 	 ways 	 	thought	that	was	an	 un 	 fair 	 	question	.
It	presupposes	that	we	ca	n't	be	what	we	 al 	 ready 	 	are	.
We	 we 	 re 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	.
When	I	was	a	kid	,	I	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	a	man	.
I	 want 	 ed 	 	a	 register 	 ed 	 	 retire 	 ment 	 	 saving 	 s 	 	plan	that	would	keep	me	in	 can 	 dy 	 	long	 en 	 ough 	 	to	make	old	age	sweet	.
When	I	was	a	kid	,	I	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 s 	 have 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	not	so	much	.
When	I	was	eight	,	I	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	a	marine	biologist	.
When	I	was	nine	,	I	saw	the	movie	``	 Jaw 	 s 	 	,	''	and	thought	to	 my 	 self 	 	,	``	No	,	thank	you	.	''
And	when	I	was	10	,	I	was	told	that	my	 parent 	 s 	 	left	 be 	 cause 	 	they	did	n't	want	me	.
When	I	was	11	,	I	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	left	 al 	 one 	 	.
When	I	was	12	,	I	 want 	 ed 	 	to	die	.	When	I	was	13	,	I	 want 	 ed 	 	to	kill	a	kid	.
When	I	was	14	,	I	was	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	 serious 	 ly 	 	consider	a	 care 	 er 	 	path	.
I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	I	'd	like	to	be	a	writer	.	''
And	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 Choos 	 e 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	realistic	.	''
So	I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 Profess 	 ional 	 	wrestler	.	''
And	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Do	n't	be	stupid	.	''
See	,	they	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	what	I	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	,	then	told	me	what	not	to	be	.
And	I	was	n't	the	 on 	 ly 	 	one	.
We	 we 	 re 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	told	that	we	 some 	 how 	 	must	 be 	 come 	 	what	we	are	not	,	 sacri 	 f 	 ic 	 ing 	 	what	we	are	to	inherit	the	masquerade	of	what	we	will	be	.
I	was	 be 	 ing 	 	told	to	accept	the	 ident 	 ity 	 	that	 other 	 s 	 	will	give	me	.
And	I	 wonder 	 ed 	 	,	what	made	my	 dream 	 s 	 	so	easy	to	dismiss	?
 Grant 	 ed 	 	,	my	 dream 	 s 	 	are	 s 	 hy 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	Canadian	.
My	 dream 	 s 	 	are	 self 	 - 	 conscious 	 	and	 over 	 ly 	 	apologetic	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	 stand 	 ing 	 	 al 	 one 	 	at	the	high	school	dance	,	and	they	've	never	 be 	 en 	 	 kiss 	 ed 	 	.
See	,	my	 dream 	 s 	 	got	 call 	 ed 	 	 name 	 s 	 	too	.
 Sil 	 ly 	 	.	Foolish	.	 Im 	 possible 	 	.
But	I	 ke 	 pt 	 	 dream 	 ing 	 	.
I	was	going	to	be	a	wrestler	.	I	had	it	all	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	.
I	was	going	to	be	The	 Gar 	 bag 	 e 	 	Man	.
My	 finish 	 ing 	 	move	was	going	to	be	The	 T 	 rash 	 	Compactor	.
My	 say 	 ing 	 	was	going	to	be	,	``	I	'm	taking	out	the	trash	!	''
And	then	 th 	 is 	 	guy	,	 Du 	 ke 	 	``	The	Dumpster	''	Droese	,	stole	my	entire	shtick	.
I	was	 crush 	 ed 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	if	by	a	trash	 compact 	 or 	 	.
I	thought	to	 my 	 self 	 	,	``	What	now	?	Where	do	I	turn	?	''
 Poet 	 ry 	 	.
Like	a	 boom 	 er 	 ang 	 	,	the	thing	I	 love 	 d 	 	came	back	to	me	.
One	of	the	first	lines	of	 poet 	 ry 	 	I	can	remember	writing	was	in	 respons 	 e 	 	to	a	world	that	 demand 	 ed 	 	I	hate	 my 	 self 	 	.
From	age	15	to	18	,	I	 hat 	 ed 	 	 my 	 self 	 	for	 be 	 coming 	 	the	thing	that	I	loathed	:	a	 bull 	 y 	 	.
When	I	was	19	,	I	wrote	,	``	I	will	love	 my 	 self 	 	 de 	 spite 	 	the	ease	with	which	I	lean	 to 	 ward 	 	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	.	''
Standing	up	for	 your 	 self 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	to	mean	 em 	 bracing 	 	violence	.
When	I	was	a	kid	,	I	 trade 	 d 	 	in	 home 	 work 	 	 assign 	 ments 	 	for	 friend 	 ship 	 	,	then	 g 	 ave 	 	each	friend	a	late	slip	for	never	 show 	 ing 	 	up	on	time	,	and	in	most	 case 	 s 	 	not	at	all	.
I	 g 	 ave 	 	 my 	 self 	 	a	hall	pass	to	get	through	each	broken	promise	.
And	I	remember	 th 	 is 	 	plan	,	born	out	of	 frust 	 ration 	 	from	a	kid	who	 ke 	 pt 	 	 call 	 ing 	 	me	``	 Yo 	 gi 	 	,	''	then	 point 	 ed 	 	at	my	tummy	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Too	 man 	 y 	 	picnic	 basket 	 s 	 	.	''
 Turn 	 s 	 	out	it	's	not	that	hard	to	trick	 some 	 one 	 	,	and	one	day	before	class	,	I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Yeah	,	you	can	copy	my	 home 	 work 	 	,	''	and	I	 g 	 ave 	 	him	all	the	wrong	 answer 	 s 	 	that	I	'd	written	down	the	night	before	.
He	got	his	paper	back	 expect 	 ing 	 	a	near-perfect	score	,	and	could	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	it	when	he	 look 	 ed 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	room	at	me	and	held	up	a	zero	.
I	 k 	 new 	 	I	did	n't	have	to	hold	up	my	paper	of	28	out	of	30	,	but	my	satisfaction	was	complete	when	he	 look 	 ed 	 	at	me	,	 puzzl 	 ed 	 	,	and	I	thought	to	 my 	 self 	 	,	``	Smarter	than	the	average	bear	,	 mother 	 fuck 	 er 	 	.	''
 Th 	 is 	 	is	who	I	am	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	how	I	stand	up	for	 my 	 self 	 	.
When	I	was	a	kid	,	I	used	to	think	that	pork	 chop 	 s 	 	and	 kar 	 ate 	 	 chop 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	the	same	thing	.
I	thought	they	 we 	 re 	 	both	pork	 chop 	 s 	 	.
And	 be 	 cause 	 	my	 grand 	 mother 	 	thought	it	was	cute	,	and	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	,	she	let	me	keep	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
Not	 re 	 ally 	 	a	big	deal	.
One	day	,	before	I	 real 	 ized 	 	fat	 kid 	 s 	 	are	not	designed	to	climb	 tree 	 s 	 	,	I	fell	out	of	a	tree	and	 bruis 	 ed 	 	the	right	side	of	my	body	.
I	did	n't	want	to	tell	my	 grand 	 mother 	 	about	it	 be 	 cause 	 	I	was	 scar 	 ed 	 	I	'd	get	in	trouble	for	 play 	 ing 	 	 some 	 where 	 	I	should	n't	have	 be 	 en 	 	.
A	few	 day 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	the	gym	teacher	 notice 	 d 	 	the	bruise	,	and	I	got	 s 	 ent 	 	to	the	principal	's	 off 	 ice 	 	.
From	there	,	I	was	 s 	 ent 	 	to	 an 	 other 	 	small	room	with	a	 re 	 ally 	 	nice	 lad 	 y 	 	who	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 question 	 s 	 	about	my	life	at	home	.
I	saw	no	reason	to	lie	.
 A 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	I	was	 concern 	 ed 	 	,	life	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	.
I	told	her	,	 when 	 ever 	 	I	'm	 s 	 ad 	 	,	my	 grand 	 mother 	 	 give 	 s 	 	me	 kar 	 ate 	 	 chop 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	led	to	a	 full 	 - 	 scale 	 	investigation	,	and	I	was	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	from	the	house	for	three	 day 	 s 	 	,	 un 	 til 	 	they	 final 	 ly 	 	 decide 	 d 	 	to	ask	how	I	got	the	 bruis 	 es 	 	.
 New 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 il 	 ly 	 	little	story	 quick 	 ly 	 	spread	through	the	school	,	and	I	 earn 	 ed 	 	my	first	 nick 	 name 	 	:	Porkchop	.
To	 th 	 is 	 	day	,	I	hate	pork	 chop 	 s 	 	.
I	'm	not	the	 on 	 ly 	 	kid	who	grew	up	 th 	 is 	 	way	,	 surround 	 ed 	 	by	people	who	used	to	say	that	 rhym 	 e 	 	about	 stick 	 s 	 	and	 stone 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	if	broken	 bone 	 s 	 	hurt	more	than	the	 name 	 s 	 	we	got	 call 	 ed 	 	,	and	we	got	 call 	 ed 	 	them	all	.
So	we	grew	up	 believ 	 ing 	 	no	one	would	ever	fall	in	love	with	us	,	that	we	'd	be	 lone 	 ly 	 	 fore 	 ver 	 	,	that	we	'd	never	meet	 some 	 one 	 	to	make	us	feel	like	the	 s 	 un 	 	was	 some 	 thing 	 	they	built	for	us	in	 the 	 ir 	 	toolshed	.
So	broken	heartstrings	bled	the	 blue 	 s 	 	,	and	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	empty	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	so	we	'd	feel	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
Do	n't	tell	me	that	hurt	less	than	a	broken	bone	,	that	an	ingrown	life	is	 some 	 thing 	 	 surgeon 	 s 	 	can	cut	away	,	that	there	's	no	way	for	it	to	 metasta 	 s 	 ize 	 	;	it	 do 	 es 	 	.
She	was	eight	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	our	first	day	of	grade	three	when	she	got	 call 	 ed 	 	 ug 	 ly 	 	.
We	both	got	 move 	 d 	 	to	the	back	of	class	so	we	would	stop	 get 	 ting 	 	 bombard 	 ed 	 	by	spitballs	.
But	the	school	 hall 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	a	 battle 	 ground 	 	.
We	found	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	outnumbered	day	after	 wr 	 etch 	 ed 	 	day	.
We	used	to	stay	 in 	 side 	 	for	recess	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 out 	 side 	 	was	 wo 	 rse 	 	.
 Out 	 side 	 	,	we	'd	have	to	 rehears 	 e 	 	running	away	,	or	learn	to	stay	still	like	 statue 	 s 	 	,	giving	no	 clue 	 s 	 	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	there	.
In	grade	five	,	they	taped	a	sign	to	the	front	of	her	desk	that	read	,	``	 Be 	 ware 	 	of	dog	.	''
To	 th 	 is 	 	day	,	 de 	 spite 	 	a	loving	husband	,	she	 do 	 es 	 	n't	think	she	's	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	a	birthmark	that	 take 	 s 	 	up	a	little	less	than	half	her	face	.
 Kid 	 s 	 	used	to	say	,	``	She	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	wrong	answer	that	 some 	 one 	 	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	 er 	 ase 	 	,	but	could	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	get	the	job	 d 	 one 	 	.	''
And	they	'll	never	understand	that	she	's	raising	two	 kid 	 s 	 	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	definition	of	 beaut 	 y 	 	 begin 	 s 	 	with	the	word	``	Mom	,	''	 be 	 cause 	 	they	see	her	heart	before	they	see	her	skin	,	 be 	 cause 	 	she	's	 on 	 ly 	 	ever	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
He	was	a	broken	branch	 graft 	 ed 	 	onto	a	different	family	tree	,	 adopt 	 ed 	 	,	not	 be 	 cause 	 	his	 parent 	 s 	 	 opt 	 ed 	 	for	a	different	 de 	 s 	 tin 	 y 	 	.
He	was	three	when	he	 be 	 came 	 	a	 mix 	 ed 	 	drink	of	one	part	left	 al 	 one 	 	and	two	 part 	 s 	 	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	,	 start 	 ed 	 	therapy	in	eighth	grade	,	had	a	 personal 	 ity 	 	made	up	of	 test 	 s 	 	and	 pill 	 s 	 	,	lived	like	the	uphills	 we 	 re 	 	 mountain 	 s 	 	and	the	downhills	 we 	 re 	 	 cliff 	 s 	 	,	four	fifths	 sui 	 cidal 	 	,	a	 tid 	 al 	 	wave	of	 anti 	 depress 	 ants 	 	,	and	an	adolescence	 be 	 ing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 Pop 	 per 	 	,	''	one	part	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 pill 	 s 	 	,	99	 part 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 cruel 	 ty 	 	.
He	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	kill	 him 	 self 	 	in	grade	10	when	a	kid	who	could	still	go	home	to	Mom	and	 Da 	 d 	 	had	the	 au 	 da 	 city 	 	to	tell	him	,	``	Get	over	it	.	''
 A 	 s 	 	if	 depress 	 ion 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	could	be	remedied	by	any	of	the	 content 	 s 	 	found	in	a	first	aid	kit	.
To	 th 	 is 	 	day	,	he	is	a	stick	of	 T 	 NT 	 	lit	from	both	 end 	 s 	 	,	could	 de 	 scribe 	 	to	you	in	detail	the	way	the	sky	 bend 	 s 	 	in	the	moment	before	it	's	about	to	fall	,	and	 de 	 spite 	 	an	 arm 	 y 	 	of	 friend 	 s 	 	who	all	call	him	an	inspiration	,	he	 remain 	 s 	 	a	conversation	piece	between	people	who	ca	n't	understand	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	drug-free	 ha 	 s 	 	less	to	do	with	 addict 	 ion 	 	and	more	to	do	with	 sanit 	 y 	 	.
We	 we 	 re 	 	n't	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	who	grew	up	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
To	 th 	 is 	 	day	,	 kid 	 s 	 	are	still	 be 	 ing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 name 	 s 	 	.
The	 classic 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	,	``	Hey	stupid	,	''	``	Hey	spaz	.	''
Seems	like	every	school	 ha 	 s 	 	an	arsenal	of	 name 	 s 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 update 	 d 	 	every	year	,	and	if	a	kid	 break 	 s 	 	in	a	school	and	no	one	around	 choos 	 es 	 	to	hear	,	do	they	make	a	sound	?
 A 	 re 	 	they	just	 back 	 ground 	 	noise	from	a	 sound 	 track 	 	 s 	 tuck 	 	on	repeat	when	people	say	 thing 	 s 	 	like	,	``	 Kid 	 s 	 	can	be	cruel	.	''
Every	school	was	a	big	top	circus	tent	,	and	the	 peck 	 ing 	 	order	went	from	acrobats	to	lion	tamers	,	from	clowns	to	carnies	,	all	of	these	 mile 	 s 	 	 a 	 head 	 	of	who	we	 we 	 re 	 	.
We	 we 	 re 	 	 freak 	 s 	 	--	 lob 	 ster 	 	claw	 boy 	 s 	 	and	 beard 	 ed 	 	 lad 	 ies 	 	,	 odd 	 ities 	 	 jug 	 gling 	 	 depress 	 ion 	 	and	 lone 	 lines 	 s 	 	,	 play 	 ing 	 	solitaire	,	spin	the	bottle	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	kiss	the	 wound 	 ed 	 	 part 	 s 	 	of	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	and	heal	,	but	at	night	,	while	the	 other 	 s 	 	slept	,	we	 ke 	 pt 	 	 walk 	 ing 	 	the	tightrope	.
It	was	practice	,	and	 y 	 es 	 	,	some	of	us	fell	.
But	I	want	to	tell	them	that	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	 deb 	 ris 	 	left	over	when	we	 final 	 ly 	 	decide	to	 s 	 mash 	 	all	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	thought	we	used	to	be	,	and	if	you	ca	n't	see	 any 	 thing 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	about	 your 	 self 	 	,	get	a	better	mirror	,	look	a	little	 close 	 r 	 	,	 star 	 e 	 	a	little	 long 	 er 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	 in 	 side 	 	you	that	made	you	keep	 try 	 ing 	 	 de 	 spite 	 	 every 	 one 	 	who	told	you	to	quit	.
You	built	a	cast	around	your	broken	heart	and	 sign 	 ed 	 	it	 your 	 self 	 	.
You	 sign 	 ed 	 	it	,	``	 The 	 y 	 	 we 	 re 	 	wrong	.	''
 Be 	 cause 	 	 may 	 be 	 	you	did	n't	belong	to	a	group	or	a	 cl 	 ique 	 	.
 May 	 be 	 	they	 decide 	 d 	 	to	pick	you	last	for	 basket 	 ball 	 	or	 every 	 thing 	 	.
 May 	 be 	 	you	used	to	 br 	 ing 	 	 bruis 	 es 	 	and	broken	 tee 	 th 	 	to	 show 	 - 	 and 	 - 	 tell 	 	,	but	never	told	,	 be 	 cause 	 	how	can	you	hold	your	ground	if	 every 	 one 	 	around	you	 want 	 s 	 	to	bury	you	 be 	 neath 	 	it	?
You	have	to	 believ 	 e 	 	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	wrong	.
 The 	 y 	 	have	to	be	wrong	.
Why	else	would	we	still	be	here	?
We	grew	up	 learn 	 ing 	 	to	cheer	on	the	 under 	 dog 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	see	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	in	them	.
We	stem	from	a	root	 plant 	 ed 	 	in	the	belief	that	we	are	not	what	we	 we 	 re 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	.
We	are	not	 abandon 	 ed 	 	 car 	 s 	 	 stall 	 ed 	 	out	and	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	empty	on	some	 high 	 way 	 	,	and	if	in	some	way	we	are	,	do	n't	worry	.
We	 on 	 ly 	 	got	out	to	walk	and	get	gas	.
We	are	 gradu 	 ating 	 	 member 	 s 	 	from	the	class	of	We	 Mad 	 e 	 	It	,	not	the	 fad 	 ed 	 	 echo 	 es 	 	of	 voice 	 s 	 	 cry 	 ing 	 	out	,	``	 Name 	 s 	 	will	never	hurt	me	.	''
Of	course	they	did	.
But	our	 live 	 s 	 	will	 on 	 ly 	 	ever	 al 	 ways 	 	 continu 	 e 	 	to	be	a	 balanc 	 ing 	 	act	that	 ha 	 s 	 	less	to	do	with	pain	and	more	to	do	with	 beaut 	 y 	 	.
We	're	going	to	talk	--	my	--	a	new	 lectur 	 e 	 	,	just	for	TED	--	and	I	'm	going	show	you	some	 illusion 	 s 	 	that	we	've	 create 	 d 	 	for	TED	,	and	I	'm	going	to	try	to	 re 	 late 	 	 th 	 is 	 	to	happiness	.	What	I	was	 think 	 ing 	 	about	with	happiness	is	,	what	 give 	 s 	 	happiness	--	or	happiness	,	which	I	equate	with	joy	in	my	 part 	 icular 	 	area	,	and	I	think	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	fundamental	.	And	I	was	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	.	And	it	's	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	both	 illusion 	 s 	 	and	 movie 	 s 	 	that	we	go	see	and	 joke 	 s 	 	and	magic	 show 	 s 	 	is	that	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	about	these	 thing 	 s 	 	where	our	 expect 	 ations 	 	are	 viol 	 ated 	 	in	some	sort	of	 pleas 	 ing 	 	way	.	You	go	see	a	movie	.	And	it	 ha 	 s 	 	an	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	twist	--	 some 	 thing 	 	that	you	did	n't	expect	--	and	you	find	a	 joy 	 ful 	 	experience	.	You	look	at	 t 	 hose 	 	sort	of	 illusion 	 s 	 	in	my	book	and	it	's	not	 a 	 s 	 	what	you	'd	expect	.	And	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	 joy 	 ful 	 	about	it	.	And	it	's	the	same	thing	with	 joke 	 s 	 	and	all	these	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.	So	,	what	I	'm	going	to	try	and	do	in	my	 lectur 	 e 	 	is	go	a	little	bit	further	and	see	if	I	can	 viol 	 ate 	 	your	 expect 	 ations 	 	in	a	 pleas 	 ing 	 	way	.	I	mean	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 expect 	 ations 	 	that	are	 viol 	 ated 	 	are	not	 pleas 	 ant 	 	,	but	I	'm	going	to	try	to	do	it	in	a	 pleas 	 ant 	 	way	,	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 prim 	 al 	 	way	,	so	I	can	make	the	audience	here	happy	.
So	I	'm	going	to	show	you	some	ways	that	we	can	 viol 	 ate 	 	your	 expect 	 ations 	 	.	First	of	all	,	I	want	to	show	you	the	 part 	 icular 	 	illusion	here	.	I	want	you	first	of	all	when	it	 pop 	 s 	 	up	on	the	screen	to	notice	that	the	two	 hole 	 s 	 	are	 per 	 pend 	 icular 	 	to	each	other	.	 Th 	 ese 	 	are	all	 per 	 cept 	 ual 	 	 trick 	 s 	 	.	 Th 	 ese 	 	are	real	 object 	 s 	 	that	I	'm	going	to	show	you	.	 N 	 ow 	 	I	'm	going	to	show	you	how	it	is	 d 	 one 	 	.	I	've	 loop 	 ed 	 	the	film	here	so	you	can	get	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	experience	.	I	want	you	to	see	how	 th 	 is 	 	illusion	is	 construct 	 ed 	 	,	and	it	's	going	to	 rot 	 ate 	 	so	you	see	that	it	's	 in 	 side 	 	out	.	 N 	 ow 	 	watch	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 rot 	 ates 	 	back	,	how	 quick 	 ly 	 	your	 per 	 ception 	 	 snap 	 s 	 	.	 O 	 K 	 	now	.
 Wat 	 ch 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	it	 rot 	 ates 	 	back	 aga 	 in 	 	.	And	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	bright	audience	,	all	right	?	See	if	you	can	stop	it	from	 happen 	 ing 	 	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	you	know	100	percent	it	's	true	that	--	 b 	 am 	 	!	You	ca	n't	 un 	 do 	 	it	.	What	 do 	 es 	 	that	tell	you	about	 your 	 s 	 elves 	 	?	We	're	going	to	do	it	 aga 	 in 	 	.	No	doubt	about	it	.	See	if	you	can	stop	it	from	 happen 	 ing 	 	.	No	.	It	's	difficult	.
And	we	can	 viol 	 ate 	 	your	 expect 	 ations 	 	in	a	whole	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	ways	about	 represent 	 ation 	 	,	about	shape	,	about	color	and	so	forth	and	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 prim 	 al 	 	.	And	it	's	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	question	to	ponder	,	why	these	 thing 	 s 	 	--	we	find	these	 thing 	 s 	 	 joy 	 ful 	 	.	Why	would	we	find	them	 joy 	 ful 	 	?	So	,	here	's	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 L 	 ion 	 el 	 	did	a	while	ago	.	I	like	these	sort	of	little	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 Aga 	 in 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	an	optical	trick	.	 Th 	 is 	 	is	what	you	would	see	.	In	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	it	's	not	a	camera	cut	.	It	's	a	 per 	 cept 	 ual 	 	trick	.
 O 	 K. 	 	We	can	 viol 	 ate 	 	your	 expect 	 ations 	 	about	shape	.
We	can	 viol 	 ate 	 	your	 expect 	 ations 	 	on	 represent 	 ation 	 	--	what	an	image	 represent 	 s 	 	.	What	do	you	see	here	?
How	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	here	see	 dolphin 	 s 	 	?	 Ra 	 ise 	 	your	hand	if	you	see	 dolphin 	 s 	 	.	 O 	 K 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	people	who	raised	 the 	 ir 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	,	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	,	the	rest	of	the	audience	,	go	talk	to	them	,	all	right	?	 Actu 	 ally 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	best	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 prim 	 ing 	 	by	experience	that	I	know	.
If	you	are	a	child	under	the	age	of	10	who	have	n't	 be 	 en 	 	 ruin 	 ed 	 	yet	,	you	will	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	image	and	see	 dolphin 	 s 	 	.	 N 	 ow 	 	,	some	of	you	 adult 	 s 	 	here	are	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	What	 dolphin 	 s 	 	?	What	 dolphin 	 s 	 	?	''
But	in	fact	,	if	you	 revers 	 ed 	 	the	figure	ground	--	in	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	the	dark	 area 	 s 	 	here	--	I	 for 	 got 	 	to	ask	for	a	 point 	 er 	 	--	but	if	you	reverse	it	,	you	'll	see	a	whole	 s 	 eries 	 	of	little	 dolphin 	 s 	 	.	By	the	way	,	if	you	're	 al 	 so 	 	a	student	at	CalTech	--	they	 al 	 so 	 	tend	to	just	see	the	 dolphin 	 s 	 	.	It	's	based	on	experience	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	can	be	used	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	after	all	talk	about	design	,	too	.	 Th 	 is 	 	was	 d 	 one 	 	by	Saatchi	and	Saatchi	,	and	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	got	away	with	 th 	 is 	 	ad	in	Australia	.	So	,	if	you	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	ad	for	beer	,	all	 t 	 hose 	 	people	are	in	sort	of	 pro 	 voc 	 ative 	 	 position 	 s 	 	.	But	they	got	it	 pass 	 ed 	 	,	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	won	the	Clio	 a 	 ward 	 s 	 	,	so	it	's	funny	how	you	can	do	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 Re 	 member 	 	that	sort	of	,	um	.	 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	joke	I	did	when	the	 Flor 	 ida 	 	 ball 	 ot 	 	was	going	around	.	You	know	,	count	the	 dot 	 s 	 	for	 Go 	 re 	 	;	count	the	 dot 	 s 	 	for	Bush	;	count	'em	 aga 	 in 	 	...
You	can	 viol 	 ate 	 	your	 expect 	 ations 	 	about	experience	.	 He 	 re 	 	is	an	 out 	 side 	 	water	fountain	that	I	 create 	 d 	 	with	some	 friend 	 s 	 	of	mine	,	but	you	can	stop	the	water	in	 drop 	 s 	 	and	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	make	all	the	 drop 	 s 	 	 levit 	 ate 	 	.	 Th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	we	're	building	for	,	you	know	,	 amuse 	 ment 	 	 park 	 s 	 	and	that	kind	of	stuff	.
 N 	 ow 	 	let	's	take	a	static	image	.	Can	you	see	 th 	 is 	 	?
Do	you	see	the	middle	section	moving	down	and	the	 out 	 er 	 	 section 	 s 	 	moving	up	?	It	's	 complete 	 ly 	 	static	.
It	's	a	static	image	.	How	 man 	 y 	 	people	see	 th 	 is 	 	illusion	?	It	's	 complete 	 ly 	 	static	.
Right	.	 N 	 ow 	 	,	when	--	it	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	that	when	we	look	at	an	image	we	see	,	you	know	,	color	,	depth	,	 text 	 ure 	 	.	And	you	can	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	whole	scene	and	 analyz 	 e 	 	it	.	You	can	see	the	woman	is	in	 close 	 r 	 	than	the	wall	and	so	forth	.	But	the	whole	thing	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	flat	.	It	's	 paint 	 ed 	 	.	It	's	 trom 	 pe 	 	l'oeil	.
And	it	was	 s 	 uch 	 	a	good	 trom 	 pe 	 	l'oeil	that	people	got	 irrit 	 ated 	 	when	they	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	talk	to	the	woman	and	she	would	n't	respond	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	you	can	make	design	 mistak 	 es 	 	.	Like	 th 	 is 	 	building	in	New	York	.	So	that	when	you	see	it	from	 th 	 is 	 	side	,	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	the	 balc 	 onies 	 	tilt	up	,	and	when	you	walk	around	to	the	other	side	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	the	 balc 	 onies 	 	go	down	.	So	there	are	 case 	 s 	 	where	you	have	 mistak 	 es 	 	in	design	that	 in 	 corporate 	 	 illusion 	 s 	 	.
Or	,	you	take	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	 un 	 - 	 re 	 touch 	 ed 	 	photograph	.	 N 	 ow 	 	,	 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	I	get	a	lot	of	 email 	 s 	 	from	people	who	say	,	``	 I 	 s 	 	there	any	 per 	 cept 	 ual 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	 male 	 s 	 	and	 female 	 s 	 	?	''
And	I	 re 	 ally 	 	say	,	``	No	.	''	I	mean	,	women	can	 navig 	 ate 	 	through	the	world	just	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	 male 	 s 	 	can	--	and	why	would	n't	they	?	 How 	 ever 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	one	illusion	that	women	can	 consist 	 ent 	 ly 	 	do	better	than	 male 	 s 	 	:	in	 match 	 ing 	 	which	head	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 re 	 ly 	 	on	fashion	 cue 	 s 	 	.	 The 	 y 	 	can	match	the	hat	.
 Oka 	 y 	 	,	now	 get 	 ting 	 	to	a	part	--	I	want	to	show	design	in	 illusion 	 s 	 	.	I	 believ 	 e 	 	that	the	first	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 illusion 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	used	 purpose 	 ly 	 	was	by	da	Vinci	in	 th 	 is 	 	 ana 	 morphic 	 	image	of	an	eye	.	So	that	when	you	saw	from	one	little	angle	was	like	 th 	 is 	 	.	And	 th 	 is 	 	little	 techni 	 que 	 	got	popular	in	the	16th	century	and	the	17th	century	to	 dis 	 guise 	 	 hid 	 den 	 	 meaning 	 s 	 	,	where	you	could	flip	the	image	and	see	it	from	one	little	point	of	view	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
But	these	are	early	 in 	 corporation 	 s 	 	of	 illusion 	 s 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	to	--	sort	of	high	point	with	 Han 	 s 	 	 Hol 	 be 	 in 	 	's	``	 Ambassador 	 s 	 	.	''	And	 Han 	 s 	 	 Hol 	 be 	 in 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	for	 Hen 	 ry 	 	 V 	 III 	 	.	 Th 	 is 	 	was	hung	on	a	wall	where	you	could	walk	down	from	the	stair	and	you	can	see	 th 	 is 	 	 hid 	 den 	 	skull	.
All	right	,	now	I	'm	going	to	show	you	some	 design 	 ers 	 	who	work	with	 illusion 	 s 	 	to	give	that	element	of	surprise	.	One	of	my	 favor 	 ites 	 	is	Scott	Kim	.	I	 work 	 ed 	 	with	Scott	to	create	some	 illusion 	 s 	 	for	TED	that	I	hope	you	will	enjoy	.	We	have	one	here	on	TED	and	happiness	.
 O 	 K 	 	now	.	Arthur	[	 Gan 	 son 	 	]	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 talk 	 ed 	 	yet	,	but	his	is	going	to	be	a	 de 	 light 	 ful 	 	talk	and	he	 ha 	 s 	 	some	of	his	 re 	 ally 	 	fantastic	 machine 	 s 	 	 out 	 side 	 	.	And	so	,	we	--	Scott	 create 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	tribute	to	Arthur	 Gan 	 son 	 	.
Well	,	there	's	analog	and	digital	.	 Though 	 t 	 	that	was	appropriate	here	.
And	figure	 go 	 es 	 	to	ground	.
And	for	the	 music 	 ians 	 	.
And	of	course	,	since	happiness	--	we	want	``	joy	to	the	world	.	''
 N 	 ow 	 	,	 an 	 other 	 	great	 design 	 er 	 	--	he	's	 ver 	 y 	 	well	known	in	Japan	--	 Shi 	 geo 	 	Fukuda	.	And	he	just	 build 	 s 	 	some	fantastic	 thing 	 s 	 	.	 Th 	 is 	 	is	 simpl 	 y 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.	 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	pile	of	junk	that	when	you	view	it	from	one	 part 	 icular 	 	angle	,	you	see	 it 	 s 	 	 reflect 	 ion 	 	in	the	mirror	 a 	 s 	 	a	perfect	piano	.
