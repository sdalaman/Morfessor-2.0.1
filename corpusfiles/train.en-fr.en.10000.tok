It	can	be	a	very	complicated	thing	,	the	ocean	.
And	it	can	be	a	very	complicated	thing	,	what	human	health	is	.
And	bringing	those	two	together	might	seem	a	very	daunting	task	,
but	what	I	'm	going	to	try	to	say	is	that	even	in	that	complexity	,	there	's	some	simple	themes	that	I	think	,	if	we	understand	,	we	can	really	move	forward	.
And	those	simple	themes	are	n't	really	themes	about	the	complex	science	of	what	's	going	on	,	but	things	that	we	all	pretty	well	know	.
And	I	'm	going	to	start	with	this	one	:	If	momma	ai	n't	happy	,	ai	n't	nobody	happy	.
We	know	that	,	right	?	We	've	experienced	that	.
And	if	we	just	take	that	and	we	build	from	there	,	then	we	can	go	to	the	next	step	,	which	is	that	if	the	ocean	ai	n't	happy	,	ai	n't	nobody	happy	.
That	's	the	theme	of	my	talk	.
And	we	're	making	the	ocean	pretty	unhappy	in	a	lot	of	different	ways	.
This	is	a	shot	of	Cannery	Row	in	1932	.
Cannery	Row	,	at	the	time	,	had	the	biggest	industrial	canning	operation	on	the	west	coast	.
We	piled	enormous	amounts	of	pollution	into	the	air	and	into	the	water	.
Rolf	Bolin	,	who	was	a	professor	at	the	Hopkin	's	Marine	Station	where	I	work	,	wrote	in	the	1940s	that	``	The	fumes	from	the	scum	floating	on	the	inlets	of	the	bay	were	so	bad	they	turned	lead-based	paints	black	.	''
People	working	in	these	canneries	could	barely	stay	there	all	day	because	of	the	smell	,
but	you	know	what	they	came	out	saying	?
They	say	,	``	You	know	what	you	smell	?
You	smell	money	.	''
That	pollution	was	money	to	that	community	,
and	those	people	dealt	with	the	pollution	and	absorbed	it	into	their	skin	and	into	their	bodies	because	they	needed	the	money	.
We	made	the	ocean	unhappy	;	we	made	people	very	unhappy	,	and	we	made	them	unhealthy	.
The	connection	between	ocean	health	and	human	health	is	actually	based	upon	another	couple	simple	adages	,
and	I	want	to	call	that	``	pinch	a	minnow	,	hurt	a	whale	.	''
The	pyramid	of	ocean	life	...
Now	,	when	an	ecologist	looks	at	the	ocean	--	I	have	to	tell	you	--	we	look	at	the	ocean	in	a	very	different	way	,	and	we	see	different	things	than	when	a	regular	person	looks	at	the	ocean	because	when	an	ecologist	looks	at	the	ocean	,	we	see	all	those	interconnections	.
We	see	the	base	of	the	food	chain	,	the	plankton	,	the	small	things	,	and	we	see	how	those	animals	are	food	to	animals	in	the	middle	of	the	pyramid	,	and	on	so	up	this	diagram	.
And	that	flow	,	that	flow	of	life	,	from	the	very	base	up	to	the	very	top	,	is	the	flow	that	ecologists	see	.
And	that	's	what	we	're	trying	to	preserve
when	we	say	,	``	Save	the	ocean	.	Heal	the	ocean	.	''
It	's	that	pyramid	.
Now	why	does	that	matter	for	human	health	?
Because	when	we	jam	things	in	the	bottom	of	that	pyramid	that	should	n't	be	there	,	some	very	frightening	things	happen	.
Pollutants	,	some	pollutants	have	been	created	by	us	:	molecules	like	PCBs	that	ca	n't	be	broken	down	by	our	bodies	.
And	they	go	in	the	base	of	that	pyramid	,	and	they	drift	up	;	they	're	passed	up	that	way	,	on	to	predators	and	on	to	the	top	predators	,
and	in	so	doing	,	they	accumulate	.
Now	,	to	bring	that	home	,	I	thought	I	'd	invent	a	little	game	.
We	do	n't	really	have	to	play	it	;	we	can	just	think	about	it	here	.
It	's	the	Styrofoam	and	chocolate	game	.
Imagine	that	when	we	got	on	this	boat	,	we	were	all	given	two	Styrofoam	peanuts	.
Ca	n't	do	much	with	them	:	Put	them	in	your	pocket	.
Suppose	the	rules	are	:	every	time	you	offer	somebody	a	drink	,	you	give	them	the	drink	,	and	you	give	them	your	Styrofoam	peanuts	too	.
What	'll	happen	is	that	the	Styrofoam	peanuts	will	start	moving	through	our	society	here	,	and	they	will	accumulate	in	the	drunkest	,	stingiest	people	.
There	's	no	mechanism	in	this	game	for	them	to	go	anywhere	but	into	a	bigger	and	bigger	pile	of	indigestible	Styrofoam	peanuts	.
And	that	's	exactly	what	happens	with	PDBs	in	this	food	pyramid	:
They	accumulate	into	the	top	of	it	.
Now	suppose	,	instead	of	Styrofoam	peanuts	,	we	take	these	lovely	little	chocolates	that	we	get	and	we	had	those	instead	.
Well	,	some	of	us	would	be	eating	those	chocolates	instead	of	passing	them	around	,
and	instead	of	accumulating	,	they	will	just	pass	into	our	group	here	and	not	accumulate	in	any	one	group
because	they	're	absorbed	by	us	.
And	that	's	the	difference	between	a	PCB	and	,	say	,	something	natural	like	an	omega-3	,	something	we	want	out	of	the	marine	food	chain	.
PCBs	accumulate	.
We	have	great	examples	of	that	,	unfortunately	.
PCBs	accumulate	in	dolphins	in	Sarasota	Bay	,	in	Texas	,	in	North	Carolina	.
They	get	into	the	food	chain	.
The	dolphins	eat	the	fish	that	have	PCBs	from	the	plankton	,	and	those	PCBs	,	being	fat-soluble	,	accumulate	in	these	dolphins	.
Now	,	a	dolphin	,	mother	dolphin	,	any	dolphin	--	there	's	only	one	way	that	a	PCB	can	get	out	of	a	dolphin	.
And	what	's	that	?
In	mother	's	milk	.
Here	's	a	diagram	of	the	PCB	load	of	dolphins	in	Sarasota	Bay	.
Adult	males	:	a	huge	load	.
Juveniles	:	a	huge	load	.
Females	after	their	first	calf	is	already	weaned	:	a	lower	load	.
Those	females	,	they	're	not	trying	to	.
Those	females	are	passing	the	PCBs	in	the	fat	of	their	own	mother	's	milk	into	their	offspring	,
and	their	offspring	do	n't	survive	.
The	death	rate	in	these	dolphins	,	for	the	first	calf	born	of	every	female	dolphin	,	is	60	to	80	percent	.
These	mothers	pump	their	first	offspring	full	of	this	pollutant	,
and	most	of	them	die	.
Now	,	the	mother	then	can	go	and	reproduce	,	but	what	a	terrible	price	to	pay	for	the	accumulation	of	this	pollutant	in	these	animals	--	the	death	of	the	first-born	calf	.
There	's	another	top	predator	in	the	ocean	,	it	turns	out	.
That	top	predator	,	of	course	,	is	us	.
And	we	also	are	eating	meat	that	comes	from	some	of	these	same	places	.
This	is	whale	meat	that	I	photographed	in	a	grocery	store	in	Tokyo	--	or	is	it	?
In	fact	,	what	we	did	a	few	years	ago	was	learn	how	to	smuggle	a	molecular	biology	lab	into	Tokyo	and	use	it	to	genetically	test	the	DNA	out	of	whale	meat	samples	and	identify	what	they	really	were	.
And	some	of	those	whale	meat	samples	were	whale	meat	.
Some	of	them	were	illegal	whale	meat	,	by	the	way	.
That	's	another	story	.
But	some	of	them	were	not	whale	meat	at	all	.
Even	though	they	were	labeled	whale	meat	,	they	were	dolphin	meat	.
Some	of	them	were	dolphin	liver	.	Some	of	them	were	dolphin	blubber	.
And	those	dolphin	parts	had	a	huge	load	of	PCBs	,	dioxins	and	heavy	metals	.
And	that	huge	load	was	passing	into	the	people	that	ate	this	meat	.
It	turns	out	that	a	lot	of	dolphins	are	being	sold	as	meat	in	the	whale	meat	market	around	the	world	.
That	's	a	tragedy	for	those	populations	,
but	it	's	also	a	tragedy	for	the	people	eating	them	because	they	do	n't	know	that	that	's	toxic	meat	.
We	had	these	data	a	few	years	ago	.
I	remember	sitting	at	my	desk	being	about	the	only	person	in	the	world	who	knew	that	whale	meat	being	sold	in	these	markets	was	really	dolphin	meat	,	and	it	was	toxic	.
It	had	two-to-three-to-400	times	the	toxic	loads	ever	allowed	by	the	EPA	.
And	I	remember	there	sitting	at	my	desk	thinking	,	``	Well	,	I	know	this	.	This	is	a	great	scientific	discovery	,	''
but	it	was	so	awful	.
And	for	the	very	first	time	in	my	scientific	career	,	I	broke	scientific	protocol	,	which	is	that	you	take	the	data	and	publish	them	in	scientific	journals	and	then	begin	to	talk	about	them	.
We	sent	a	very	polite	letter	to	the	Minister	of	Health	in	Japan	and	simply	pointed	out	that	this	is	an	intolerable	situation	,	not	for	us	,	but	for	the	people	of	Japan
because	mothers	who	may	be	breastfeeding	,	who	may	have	young	children	,	would	be	buying	something	that	they	thought	was	healthy	,	but	it	was	really	toxic	.
That	led	to	a	whole	series	of	other	campaigns	in	Japan	,
and	I	'm	really	proud	to	say	that	at	this	point	,	it	's	very	difficult	to	buy	anything	in	Japan	that	's	labeled	incorrectly	,	even	though	they	're	still	selling	whale	meat	,	which	I	believe	they	should	n't	.
But	at	least	it	's	labeled	correctly	,
and	you	're	no	longer	going	to	be	buying	toxic	dolphin	meat	instead	.
It	is	n't	just	there	that	this	happens	,	but	in	a	natural	diet	of	some	communities	in	the	Canadian	arctic	and	in	the	United	States	and	in	the	European	arctic	,	a	natural	diet	of	seals	and	whales	leads	to	an	accumulation	of	PCBs	that	have	gathered	up	from	all	parts	of	the	world	and	ended	up	in	these	women	.
These	women	have	toxic	breast	milk	.
They	can	not	feed	their	offspring	,	their	children	,	their	breast	milk	because	of	the	accumulation	of	these	toxins	in	their	food	chain	,	in	their	part	of	the	world	's	ocean	pyramid	.
That	means	their	immune	systems	are	compromised	.
It	means	that	their	children	's	development	can	be	compromised	.
And	the	world	's	attention	on	this	over	the	last	decade	has	reduced	the	problem	for	these	women	,	not	by	changing	the	pyramid	,	but	by	changing	what	they	particularly	eat	out	of	it	.
We	've	taken	them	out	of	their	natural	pyramid	in	order	to	solve	this	problem	.
That	's	a	good	thing	for	this	particular	acute	problem	,	but	it	does	nothing	to	solve	the	pyramid	problem	.
There	's	other	ways	of	breaking	the	pyramid	.
The	pyramid	,	if	we	jam	things	in	the	bottom	,	can	get	backed	up	like	a	sewer	line	that	's	clogged	.
And	if	we	jam	nutrients	,	sewage	,	fertilizer	in	the	base	of	that	food	pyramid	,	it	can	back	up	all	through	it	.
We	end	up	with	things	we	've	heard	about	before	:	red	tides	,	for	example	,	which	are	blooms	of	toxic	algae	floating	through	the	oceans	causing	neurological	damage	.
We	can	also	see	blooms	of	bacteria	,	blooms	of	viruses	in	the	ocean	.
These	are	two	shots	of	a	red	tide	coming	on	shore	here	and	a	bacteria	in	the	genus	vibrio	,	which	includes	the	genus	that	has	cholera	in	it	.
How	many	people	have	seen	a	``	beach	closed	''	sign	?
Why	does	that	happen	?
It	happens	because	we	have	jammed	so	much	into	the	base	of	the	natural	ocean	pyramid	that	these	bacteria	clog	it	up	and	overfill	onto	our	beaches	.
Often	what	jams	us	up	is	sewage	.
Now	how	many	of	you	have	ever	gone	to	a	state	park	or	a	national	park	where	you	had	a	big	sign	at	the	front	saying	,	``	Closed	because	human	sewage	is	so	far	over	this	park	that	you	ca	n't	use	it	''	?
Not	very	often	.	We	would	n't	tolerate	that	.
We	would	n't	tolerate	our	parks	being	swamped	by	human	sewage	,
but	beaches	are	closed	a	lot	in	our	country	.	They	're	closed	more	and	more	and	more	all	around	the	world	for	the	same	reason	,
and	I	believe	we	should	n't	tolerate	that	either	.
It	's	not	just	a	question	of	cleanliness	;
it	's	also	a	question	of	how	those	organisms	then	turn	into	human	disease	.
These	vibrios	,	these	bacteria	,	can	actually	infect	people	.
They	can	go	into	your	skin	and	create	skin	infections	.
This	is	a	graph	from	NOAA	's	ocean	and	human	health	initiative	,	showing	the	rise	of	the	infections	by	vibrio	in	people	over	the	last	few	years	.
Surfers	,	for	example	,	know	this	incredibly	.
And	if	you	can	see	on	some	surfing	sites	,	in	fact	,	not	only	do	you	see	what	the	waves	are	like	or	what	the	weather	's	like	,	but	on	some	surf	rider	sites	,	you	see	a	little	flashing	poo	alert	.
That	means	that	the	beach	might	have	great	waves	,	but	it	's	a	dangerous	place	for	surfers	to	be	because	they	can	carry	with	them	,	even	after	a	great	day	of	surfing	,	this	legacy	of	an	infection	that	might	take	a	very	long	time	to	solve	.
Some	of	these	infections	are	actually	carrying	antibiotic	resistance	genes	now	,
and	that	makes	them	even	more	difficult	.
These	same	infections	create	harmful	algal	blooms	.
Those	blooms	are	generating	other	kinds	of	chemicals	.
This	is	just	a	simple	list	of	some	of	the	types	of	poisons	that	come	out	of	these	harmful	algal	blooms	:	shellfish	poisoning	,	fish	ciguatera	,	diarrheic	shellfish	poisoning	--	you	do	n't	want	to	know	about	that	--	neurotoxic	shellfish	poisoning	,	paralytic	shellfish	poisoning	.
These	are	things	that	are	getting	into	our	food	chain	because	of	these	blooms	.
Rita	Calwell	very	famously	traced	a	very	interesting	story	of	cholera	into	human	communities	,	brought	there	,	not	by	a	normal	human	vector	,	but	by	a	marine	vector	,	this	copepod	.
Copepods	are	small	crustaceans	.
They	're	a	tiny	fraction	of	an	inch	long	,
and	they	can	carry	on	their	little	legs	some	of	the	cholera	bacteria	that	then	leads	to	human	disease	.
That	has	sparked	cholera	epidemics	in	ports	along	the	world	and	has	led	to	increased	concentration	on	trying	to	make	sure	shipping	does	n't	move	these	vectors	of	cholera	around	the	world	.
So	what	do	you	do	?
We	have	major	problems	in	disrupted	ecosystem	flow	that	the	pyramid	may	not	be	working	so	well	,	that	the	flow	from	the	base	up	into	it	is	being	blocked	and	clogged	.
What	do	you	do	when	you	have	this	sort	of	disrupted	flow	?
Well	,	there	's	a	bunch	of	things	you	could	do	.
You	could	call	Joe	the	Plumber	,	for	example	.
And	he	could	come	in	and	fix	the	flow	.
But	in	fact	,	if	you	look	around	the	world	,	not	only	are	there	hope	spots	for	where	we	may	be	able	to	fix	problems	,	there	have	been	places	where	problems	have	been	fixed	,	where	people	have	come	to	grips	with	these	issues	and	begun	to	turn	them	around	.
Monterey	is	one	of	those	.
I	started	out	showing	how	much	we	had	distressed	the	Monterey	Bay	ecosystem	with	pollution	and	the	canning	industry	and	all	of	the	attendant	problems	.
In	1932	,	that	's	the	picture	.
In	2009	,	the	picture	is	dramatically	different	.
The	canneries	are	gone	.	The	pollution	has	abated	.
But	there	's	a	greater	sense	here	that	what	the	individual	communities	need	is	working	ecosystems	.
They	need	a	functioning	pyramid	from	the	base	all	the	way	to	the	top	.
And	that	pyramid	in	Monterey	,	right	now	,	because	of	the	efforts	of	a	lot	of	different	people	,	is	functioning	better	than	it	's	ever	functioned	for	the	last	150	years	.
It	did	n't	happen	accidentally	.
It	happened	because	many	people	put	their	time	and	effort	and	their	pioneering	spirit	into	this	.
On	the	left	there	,	Julia	Platt	,	the	mayor	of	my	little	hometown	in	Pacific	Grove	.
At	74	years	old	,	became	mayor	because	something	had	to	be	done	to	protect	the	ocean	.
In	1931	,	she	produced	California	's	first	community-based	marine	protected	area	,	right	next	to	the	biggest	polluting	cannery	,	because	Julia	knew	that	when	the	canneries	eventually	were	gone	,	the	ocean	needed	a	place	to	grow	from	,	that	the	ocean	needed	a	place	to	spark	a	seed	,
and	she	wanted	to	provide	that	seed	.
Other	people	,	like	David	Packard	and	Julie	Packard	,	who	were	instrumental	in	producing	the	Monterey	Bay	aquarium	to	lock	into	people	's	notion	that	the	ocean	and	the	health	of	the	ocean	ecosystem	were	just	as	important	to	the	economy	of	this	area	as	eating	the	ecosystem	would	be	.
That	change	in	thinking	has	led	to	a	dramatic	shift	,	not	only	in	the	fortunes	of	Monterey	Bay	,	but	other	places	around	the	world	.
Well	,	I	want	to	leave	you	with	the	thought	that	what	we	're	really	trying	to	do	here	is	protect	this	ocean	pyramid	,
and	that	ocean	pyramid	connects	to	our	own	pyramid	of	life	.
It	's	an	ocean	planet	,	and	we	think	of	ourselves	as	a	terrestrial	species	,
but	the	pyramid	of	life	in	the	ocean	and	our	own	lives	on	land	are	intricately	connected	.
And	it	's	only	through	having	the	ocean	being	healthy	that	we	can	remain	healthy	ourselves	.
Thank	you	very	much	.
Let	's	start	with	day	and	night	.
Life	evolved	under	conditions	of	light	and	darkness	,	light	and	then	darkness	.
And	so	plants	and	animals	developed	their	own	internal	clocks	so	that	they	would	be	ready	for	these	changes	in	light	.
These	are	chemical	clocks	,	and	they	're	found	in	every	known	being	that	has	two	or	more	cells	and	in	some	that	only	have	one	cell	.
I	'll	give	you	an	example	--
if	you	take	a	horseshoe	crab	off	the	beach	,	and	you	fly	it	all	the	way	across	the	continent	,	and	you	drop	it	into	a	sloped	cage	,	it	will	scramble	up	the	floor	of	the	cage	as	the	tide	is	rising	on	its	home	shores	,	and	it	'll	skitter	down	again	right	as	the	water	is	receding	thousands	of	miles	away	.
It	'll	do	this	for	weeks	,	until	it	kind	of	gradually	loses	the	plot	.
And	it	's	incredible	to	watch	,	but	there	's	nothing	psychic	or	paranormal	going	on	;	it	's	simply	that	these	crabs	have	internal	cycles	that	correspond	,	usually	,	with	what	's	going	on	around	it	.
So	,	we	have	this	ability	as	well	.
And	in	humans	,	we	call	it	the	``	body	clock	.	''
You	can	see	this	most	clearly	when	you	take	away	someone	's	watch	and	you	shut	them	into	a	bunker	,	deep	underground	,	for	a	couple	of	months	.
People	actually	volunteer	for	this	,	and	they	usually	come	out	kind	of	raving	about	their	productive	time	in	the	hole	.
So	,	no	matter	how	atypical	these	subjects	would	have	to	be	,	they	all	show	the	same	thing	.
They	get	up	just	a	little	bit	later	every	day	--	say	15	minutes	or	so	--	and	they	kind	of	drift	all	the	way	around	the	clock	like	this	over	the	course	of	the	weeks	.
And	so	,	in	this	way	we	know	that	they	are	working	on	their	own	internal	clocks	,	rather	than	somehow	sensing	the	day	outside	.
So	fine	,	we	have	a	body	clock	,	and	it	turns	out	that	it	's	incredibly	important	in	our	lives	.
It	's	a	huge	driver	for	culture	and	I	think	that	it	's	the	most	underrated	force	on	our	behavior	.
We	evolved	as	a	species	near	the	equator	,	and	so	we	're	very	well-equipped	to	deal	with	12	hours	of	daylight	and	12	hours	of	darkness	.
But	of	course	,	we	've	spread	to	every	corner	of	the	globe	and	in	Arctic	Canada	,	where	I	live	,	we	have	perpetual	daylight	in	summer	and	24	hours	of	darkness	in	winter	.
So	the	culture	,	the	northern	aboriginal	culture	,	traditionally	has	been	highly	seasonal	.
In	winter	,	there	's	a	lot	of	sleeping	going	on	;
you	enjoy	your	family	life	inside	.
And	in	summer	,	it	's	almost	manic	hunting	and	working	activity	very	long	hours	,	very	active	.
So	,	what	would	our	natural	rhythm	look	like	?
What	would	our	sleeping	patterns	be	in	the	sort	of	ideal	sense	?
Well	,	it	turns	out	that	when	people	are	living	without	any	sort	of	artificial	light	at	all	,	they	sleep	twice	every	night	.
They	go	to	bed	around	8:00	p.m	.
until	midnight	and	then	again	,	they	sleep	from	about	2:00	a.m.	until	sunrise	.
And	in-between	,	they	have	a	couple	of	hours	of	sort	of	meditative	quiet	in	bed	.
And	during	this	time	,	there	's	a	surge	of	prolactin	,	the	likes	of	which	a	modern	day	never	sees	.
The	people	in	these	studies	report	feeling	so	awake	during	the	daytime	,	that	they	realize	they	're	experiencing	true	wakefulness	for	the	first	time	in	their	lives	.
So	,	cut	to	the	modern	day	.
We	're	living	in	a	culture	of	jet	lag	,	global	travel	,	24-hour	business	,	shift	work	.
And	you	know	,	our	modern	ways	of	doing	things	have	their	advantages	,	but	I	believe	we	should	understand	the	costs	.
Thank	you	.
Adrian	Kohler	:	Well	,	we	're	here	today	to	talk	about	the	evolution	of	a	puppet	horse	.
Basil	Jones	:	But	actually	we	're	going	to	start	this	evolution	with	a	hyena	.
AK	:	The	ancestor	of	the	horse	.
Okay	,	we	'll	do	something	with	it	.
Hahahaha	.
The	hyena	is	the	ancestor	of	the	horse	because	it	was	part	of	a	production	called	``	Faustus	in	Africa	,	''	a	Handspring	Production	from	1995	,	where	it	had	to	play	draughts	with	Helen	of	Troy	.
This	production	was	directed	by	South	African	artist	and	theater	director	,	William	Kentridge	.
So	it	needed	a	very	articulate	front	paw	.
But	,	like	all	puppets	,	it	has	other	attributes	.
BJ	:	One	of	them	is	breath	,	and	it	kind	of	breathes	.
AK	:	Haa	haa	haaa	.
BJ	:	Breath	is	really	important	for	us	.
It	's	the	kind	of	original	movement	for	any	puppet	for	us	onstage	.
It	's	the	thing	that	distinguishes	the	puppet	--	AK	:	Oops	.
BJ	:	From	an	actor	.
Puppets	always	have	to	try	to	be	alive	.
It	's	their	kind	of	ur-story	onstage	,	that	desperation	to	live	.
AK	:	Yeah	,	it	's	basically	a	dead	object	,	as	you	can	see	,	and	it	only	lives	because	you	make	it	.
An	actor	struggles	to	die	onstage	,	but	a	puppet	has	to	struggle	to	live	.
And	in	a	way	that	's	a	metaphor	for	life	.
BJ	:	So	every	moment	it	's	on	the	stage	,	it	's	making	the	struggle	.
So	we	call	this	a	piece	of	emotional	engineering	that	uses	up-to-the-minute	17th	century	technology	--	to	turn	nouns	into	verbs	.
AK	:	Well	actually	I	prefer	to	say	that	it	's	an	object	constructed	out	of	wood	and	cloth	with	movement	built	into	it	to	persuade	you	to	believe	that	it	has	life	.
BJ	:	Okay	so	.
AK	:	It	has	ears	that	move	passively	when	the	head	goes	.
BJ	:	And	it	has	these	bulkheads	made	out	of	plywood	,	covered	with	fabric	--	curiously	similar	,	in	fact	,	to	the	plywood	canoes	that	Adrian	's	father	used	to	make	when	he	was	a	boy	in	their	workshop	.	AK	:	In	Port	Elizabeth	,	the	village	outside	Port	Elizabeth	in	South	Africa	.
BJ	:	His	mother	was	a	puppeteer	.
And	when	we	met	at	art	school	and	fell	in	love	in	1971	,	I	hated	puppets	.
I	really	thought	they	were	so	beneath	me	.
I	wanted	to	become	an	avant-garde	artist	--	and	Punch	and	Judy	was	certainly	not	where	I	wanted	to	go	.	And	,	in	fact	,	it	took	about	10	years
to	discover	the	Bambara	Bamana	puppets	of	Mali	in	West	Africa	,	where	there	's	a	fabulous	tradition	of	puppetry	,	to	learn	a	renewed	,	or	a	new	,	respect	for	this	art	form	.
AK	:	So	in	1981	,	I	persuaded	Basil	and	some	friends	of	mine	to	form	a	puppet	company	.
And	20	years	later	,	miraculously	,	we	collaborated	with	a	company	from	Mali	,	the	Sogolon	Marionette	Troupe	of	Bamako	,	where	we	made	a	piece	about	a	tall	giraffe	.
It	was	just	called	``	Tall	Horse	,	''	which	was	a	life-sized	giraffe	.
BJ	:	And	here	again	,	you	see	the	same	structure	.
The	bulkheads	have	now	turned	into	hoops	of	cane	,	but	it	's	ultimately	the	same	structure	.
It	's	got	two	people	inside	it	on	stilts	,	which	give	them	the	height	,	and	somebody	in	the	front	who	's	using	a	kind	of	steering	wheel	to	move	that	head	.
AK	:	The	person	in	the	hind	legs	is	also	controlling	the	tail	,	a	bit	like	the	hyena	--	same	mechanism	,	just	a	bit	bigger	.
And	he	's	controlling	the	ear	movement	.
BJ	:	So	this	production	was	seen	by	Tom	Morris	of	the	National	Theatre	in	London	.
And	just	around	that	time	,	his	mother	had	said	,	``	Have	you	seen	this	book	by	Michael	Morpurgo	called	'War	Horse	'	?	''
AK	:	It	's	about	a	boy	who	falls	in	love	with	a	horse	.
The	horse	is	sold	to	the	First	World	War	,	and	he	joins	up	to	find	his	horse	.
BJ	:	So	Tom	gave	us	a	call	and	said	,	``	Do	you	think	you	could	make	us	a	horse	for	a	show	to	happen	at	the	National	Theatre	?	''
AK	:	It	seemed	a	lovely	idea	.
BJ	:	But	it	had	to	ride	.	It	had	to	have	a	rider	.
AK	:	It	had	to	have	a	rider	,	and	it	had	to	participate	in	cavalry	charges	.
A	play	about	early	20th	century	plowing	technology	and	cavalry	charges	was	a	little	bit	of	a	challenge	for	the	accounting	department	at	the	National	Theatre	in	London	.
But	they	agreed	to	go	along	with	it	for	a	while	.
So	we	began	with	a	test	.
BJ	:	This	is	Adrian	and	Thys	Stander	,	who	went	on	to	actually	design	the	cane	system	for	the	horse	,	and	our	next-door	neighbor	Katherine	,	riding	on	a	ladder	.
The	weight	is	really	difficult	when	it	's	up	above	your	head	.
AK	:	And	once	we	put	Katherine	through	that	particular	brand	of	hell	,	we	knew	that	we	might	be	able	to	make	a	horse	,	which	could	be	ridden	.
So	we	made	a	model	.
This	is	a	cardboard	model	,	a	little	bit	smaller	than	the	hyena	.
You	'll	notice	that	the	legs	are	plywood	legs	and	the	canoe	structure	is	still	there	.
BJ	:	And	the	two	manipulators	are	inside	.
But	we	did	n't	realize	at	the	time	that	we	actually	needed	a	third	manipulator	,	because	we	could	n't	manipulate	the	neck	from	inside	and	walk	the	horse	at	the	same	time	.
AK	:	We	started	work	on	the	prototype	after	the	model	was	approved	,	and	the	prototype	took	a	bit	longer	than	we	anticipated	.
We	had	to	throw	out	the	plywood	legs	and	make	new	cane	ones	.
And	we	had	a	crate	built	for	it	.
It	had	to	be	shipped	to	London	.
We	were	going	to	test-drive	it	on	the	street	outside	of	our	house	in	Cape	Town	,	and	it	got	to	midnight	and	we	had	n't	done	that	yet	.
BJ	:	So	we	got	a	camera	,	and	we	posed	the	puppet	in	various	galloping	stances	.
And	we	sent	it	off	to	the	National	Theatre	,	hoping	that	they	believed	that	we	created	something	that	worked	.
AK	:	A	month	later	,	we	were	there	in	London	with	this	big	box	and	a	studio	full	of	people	about	to	work	with	us	.
BJ	:	About	40	people	.
AK	:	We	were	terrified	.
We	opened	the	lid	,	we	took	the	horse	out	,	and	it	did	work	;	it	walked	and	it	was	able	to	be	ridden	.
Here	I	have	an	18-second	clip	of	the	very	first	walk	of	the	prototype	.
This	is	in	the	National	Theatre	studio	,	the	place	where	they	cook	new	ideas	.
It	had	by	no	means	got	the	green	light	yet	.
The	choreographer	,	Toby	Sedgwick	,	invented	a	beautiful	sequence	where	the	baby	horse	,	which	was	made	out	of	sticks	and	bits	of	twigs	,	grew	up	into	the	big	horse	.
And	Nick	Starr	,	the	director	of	the	National	Theatre	,	saw	that	particular	moment	,	he	was	standing	next	to	me	--	he	nearly	wet	himself	.
And	so	the	show	was	given	the	green	light	.
And	we	went	back	to	Cape	Town	and	redesigned	the	horse	completely	.
Here	is	the	plan	.
And	here	is	our	factory	in	Cape	Town	where	we	make	horses	.
You	can	see	quite	a	lot	of	skeletons	in	the	background	there	.
The	horses	are	completely	handmade	.
There	is	very	little	20th	century	technology	in	them	.
We	used	a	bit	of	laser	cutting	on	the	plywood	and	some	of	the	aluminum	pieces	.
But	because	they	have	to	be	light	and	flexible	,	and	each	one	of	them	is	different	,	they	ca	n't	be	mass-produced	,	unfortunately	.
So	here	are	some	half-finished	horses	ready	to	be	worked	in	London	.
And	now	we	would	like	to	introduce	you	to	Joey	.
Joey	boy	,	you	there	?
Joey	.
Joey	.
Joey	,	come	here	.
No	,	no	,	I	have	n't	got	it	.
He	's	got	it	;	it	's	in	his	pocket	.
BJ	:	Joey	.
AK	:	Joey	,	Joey	,	Joey	,	Joey	.
Come	here	.	Stand	here	where	people	can	see	you	.
Move	around	.	Come	on	.
I	'd	just	like	to	describe	--	I	wo	n't	talk	too	loud	.	He	might	get	irritated	.
Here	,	Craig	is	working	the	head	.
He	has	bicycle	brake	cables	going	down	to	the	head	control	in	his	hand	.
Each	one	of	them	operates	either	an	ear	,	separately	,	or	the	head	,	up	and	down	.
But	he	also	controls	the	head	directly	by	using	his	hand	.
The	ears	are	obviously	a	very	important	emotional	indicator	of	the	horse	.
When	they	point	right	back	,	the	horse	is	fearful	or	angry	,	depending	upon	what	's	going	on	in	front	of	him	,	around	him	.
Or	,	when	he	's	more	relaxed	,	the	head	comes	down	and	the	ears	listen	,	either	side	.
Horses	'	hearing	is	very	important	.
It	's	almost	more	important	than	their	eyesight	.
Over	here	,	Tommy	's	got	what	you	call	the	heart	position	.
He	's	working	the	leg	.
You	see	the	string	tendon	from	the	hyena	,	the	hyena	's	front	leg	,	automatically	pulls	the	hoop	up	.
Horses	are	so	unpredictable	.
The	way	a	hoof	comes	up	with	a	horse	immediately	gives	you	the	feeling	that	it	's	a	convincing	horse	action	.
The	hind	legs	have	got	the	same	action	.
BJ	:	And	Mikey	also	has	,	in	his	fingers	,	the	ability	to	move	the	tail	from	left	to	right	,	and	up	and	down	with	the	other	hand	.
And	together	,	there	's	quite	a	complex	possibility	of	tail	expression	.
AK	:	You	want	to	say	something	about	the	breathing	?
BJ	:	We	had	a	big	challenge	with	breathing	.
Adrian	thought	that	he	was	going	to	have	to	split	the	chest	of	the	puppet	in	two	and	make	it	breathe	like	that	--	because	that	's	how	a	horse	would	breathe	,	with	an	expanded	chest	.
But	we	realized	that	,	if	that	were	to	be	happening	,	you	would	n't	,	as	an	audience	,	see	the	breath	.
So	he	made	a	channel	in	here	,	and	the	chest	moves	up	and	down	in	that	channel	.
So	it	's	anti-naturalistic	really	,	the	up	and	down	movement	,	but	it	feels	like	breath	.
And	it	's	very	,	very	simple	because	all	that	happens	is	that	the	puppeteer	breathes	with	his	knees	.
AK	:	Other	emotional	stuff	.
If	I	were	to	touch	the	horse	here	on	his	skin	,	the	heart	puppeteer	can	shake	the	body	from	inside	and	get	the	skin	to	quiver	.
You	'll	notice	,	of	course	,	that	the	puppet	is	made	out	of	cane	lines	.
And	I	would	like	you	to	believe	that	it	was	an	aesthetic	choice	,	that	I	was	making	a	three-dimensional	drawing	of	a	horse	that	somehow	moves	in	space	.
But	of	course	,	it	was	the	cane	is	light	,	the	cane	is	flexible	,	the	cane	is	durable	and	the	cane	is	moldable	.
And	so	it	was	a	very	practical	reason	why	it	was	made	of	cane	.
The	skin	itself	is	made	out	of	a	see-through	nylon	mesh	,	which	,	if	the	lighting	designer	wants	the	horse	to	almost	disappear	,	she	can	light	the	background	and	the	horse	becomes	ghostlike	.
You	see	the	skeletal	structure	of	it	.
Or	if	you	light	it	from	above	,	it	becomes	more	solid	.
Again	,	that	was	a	practical	consideration	.
The	guys	inside	the	horse	have	to	be	able	to	see	out	.
They	have	to	be	able	to	act	along	with	their	fellow	actors	in	the	production	.	And	it	's	very	much	an	in-the-moment	activity	that	they	're	engaged	in	.
It	's	three	heads	making	one	character	.
But	now	we	would	like	you	to	put	Joey	through	some	paces	.
And	plant	.
Thank	you	.
And	now	just	--	All	the	way	from	sunny	California	we	have	Zem	Joaquin	who	's	going	to	ride	the	horse	for	us	.	So	we	would	like	to	stress	that	the	performance	you	see	in	the	horse	is	three	guys	who	have	studied	horse	behavior	incredibly	thoroughly	.
BJ	:	Not	being	able	to	talk	to	one	another	while	they	're	onstage	because	they	're	mic	'd	.
The	sound	that	that	very	large	chest	makes	,	of	the	horse	--	the	whinnying	and	the	nickering	and	everything	--	that	starts	usually	with	one	performer	,	carries	on	with	a	second	person	and	ends	with	a	third	.
AK	:	Mikey	Brett	from	Leicestershire	.
Mikey	Brett	,	Craig	,	Leo	,	Zem	Joaquin	and	Basil	and	me	.
Thank	you	.	Thank	you	.
I	want	to	help	you	re-perceive	what	philanthropy	is	,	what	it	could	be	,	and	what	your	relationship	to	it	is	.
And	in	doing	that	,	I	want	to	offer	you	a	vision	,	an	imagined	future	,	if	you	will	,	of	how	,	as	the	poet	Seamus	Heaney	has	put	it	,	``	Once	in	a	lifetime	the	longed-for	tidal	wave	of	justice	can	rise	up	,	and	hope	and	history	rhyme	.	''
I	want	to	start	with	these	word	pairs	here	.
We	all	know	which	side	of	these	we	'd	like	to	be	on	.
When	philanthropy	was	reinvented	a	century	ago	,	when	the	foundation	form	was	actually	invented	,	they	did	n't	think	of	themselves	on	the	wrong	side	of	these	either	.
In	fact	they	would	never	have	thought	of	themselves	as	closed	and	set	in	their	ways	,	as	slow	to	respond	to	new	challenges	,	as	small	and	risk-averse	.
And	in	fact	they	were	n't	.	They	were	reinventing	charity	in	those	times	,
what	Rockefeller	called	``	the	business	of	benevolence	.	''
But	by	the	end	of	the	20th	century	,	a	new	generation	of	critics	and	reformers	had	come	to	see	philanthropy	just	this	way	.
The	thing	to	watch	for	as	a	global	philanthropy	industry	comes	about	--	and	that	's	exactly	what	is	happening	--	is	how	the	aspiration	is	to	flip	these	old	assumptions	,
for	philanthropy	to	become	open	and	big	and	fast	and	connected	,	in	service	of	the	long	term	.
This	entrepreneurial	energy	is	emerging	from	many	quarters	.
And	it	's	driven	and	propelled	forward	by	new	leaders	,	like	many	of	the	people	here	,	by	new	tools	,	like	the	ones	we	've	seen	here	,	and	by	new	pressures	.
I	've	been	following	this	change	for	quite	a	while	now	,	and	participating	in	it	.
This	report	is	our	main	public	report	.
What	it	tells	is	the	story	of	how	today	actually	could	be	as	historic	as	100	years	ago	.
What	I	want	to	do	is	share	some	of	the	coolest	things	that	are	going	on	with	you	.
And	as	I	do	that	,	I	'm	not	going	to	dwell	much	on	the	very	large	philanthropy	that	everybody	already	knows	about	--	the	Gates	or	the	Soros	or	the	Google	.
Instead	,	what	I	want	to	do	is	talk	about	the	philanthropy	of	all	of	us	:
the	democratization	of	philanthropy	.
This	is	a	moment	in	history	when	the	average	person	has	more	power	than	at	any	time	.
What	I	'm	going	to	do	is	look	at	five	categories	of	experiments	,	each	of	which	challenges	an	old	assumption	of	philanthropy	.
The	first	is	mass	collaboration	,	represented	here	by	Wikipedia	.
Now	,	this	may	surprise	you	.
But	remember	,	philanthropy	is	about	giving	of	time	and	talent	,	not	just	money	.
Clay	Shirky	,	that	great	chronicler	of	everything	networked	,	has	captured	the	assumption	that	this	challenges	in	such	a	beautiful	way	.
He	said	,	``	We	have	lived	in	this	world	where	little	things	are	done	for	love	and	big	things	for	money	.
Now	we	have	Wikipedia	.
Suddenly	big	things	can	be	done	for	love	.	''	Watch	,	this	spring	,	for	Paul	Hawken	's	new	book	--
Author	and	entrepreneur	many	of	you	may	know	about	.
The	book	is	called	``	Blessed	Unrest	.	''
And	when	it	comes	out	,	a	series	of	wiki	sites	under	the	label	WISER	,	are	going	to	launch	at	the	same	time	.
WISER	stands	for	World	Index	for	Social	and	Environmental	Responsibility	.
WISER	sets	out	to	document	,	link	and	empower	what	Paul	calls	the	largest	movement	,	and	fastest-growing	movement	in	human	history	:
humanity	's	collective	immune	response	to	today	's	threats	.
Now	,	all	of	these	big	things	for	love	--	experiments	--	are	n't	going	to	take	off	.
But	the	ones	that	do	are	going	to	be	the	biggest	,	the	most	open	,	the	fastest	,	the	most	connected	form	of	philanthropy	in	human	history	.
Second	category	is	online	philanthropy	marketplaces	.
This	is	,	of	course	,	to	philanthropy	what	eBay	and	Amazon	are	to	commerce	.
Think	of	it	as	peer-to-peer	philanthropy	.
And	this	challenges	yet	another	assumption	,	which	is	that	organized	philanthropy	is	only	for	the	very	wealthy	.
Take	a	look	,	if	you	have	n't	,	at	DonorsChoose	.
Omidyar	Network	has	made	a	big	investment	in	DonorsChoose	.
It	's	one	of	the	best	known	of	these	new	marketplaces	where	a	donor	can	go	straight	into	a	classroom	and	connect	with	what	a	teacher	says	they	need	.
Take	a	look	at	Changing	the	Present	,	started	by	a	TEDster	,	next	time	you	need	a	wedding	present	or	a	holiday	present	.
GiveIndia	is	for	a	whole	country	.
And	it	goes	on	and	on	.
The	third	category	is	represented	by	Warren	Buffet	,
which	I	call	aggregated	giving	.
It	's	not	just	that	Warren	Buffet	was	so	amazingly	generous	in	that	historic	act	last	summer	.
It	's	that	he	challenged	another	assumption	,	that	every	giver	should	have	his	or	her	own	fund	or	foundation	.
There	are	now	,	today	,	so	many	new	funds	that	are	aggregating	giving	and	investing	,	bringing	together	people	around	a	common	goal	,	to	think	bigger	.
One	of	the	best	known	is	Acumen	Fund	,	led	by	Jacqueline	Novogratz	,	a	TEDster	who	got	a	big	boost	here	at	TED	.
But	there	are	many	others	:	New	Profit	in	Cambridge	,	New	School	's	Venture	Fund	in	Silicon	Valley	,	Venture	Philanthropy	Partners	in	Washington	,	Global	Fund	for	Women	in	San	Francisco	.
Take	a	look	at	these	.
These	funds	are	to	philanthropy	what	venture	capital	,	private	equity	,	and	eventually	mutual	funds	are	to	investing	,
but	with	a	twist	--	because	often	a	community	forms	around	these	funds	,	as	it	has	at	Acumen	and	other	places	.
Now	,	imagine	for	a	second	these	first	three	types	of	experiments	:	mass	collaboration	,	online	marketplaces	,	aggregated	giving	.
And	understand	how	they	help	us	re-perceive	what	organized	philanthropy	is	.
It	's	not	about	foundations	necessarily	;	it	's	about	the	rest	of	us	.
And	imagine	the	mash-up	,	if	you	will	,	of	these	things	,	in	the	future	,	when	these	things	come	together	in	the	experiments	of	the	future	--	imagine	that	somebody	puts	up	,	say	,	100	million	dollars	for	an	inspiring	goal	--	there	were	21	gifts	of	100	million	dollars	or	more	in	the	US	last	year	,	not	out	of	the	question	--	but	only	puts	it	up	if	it	's	matched	by	millions	of	small	gifts	from	around	the	globe	,
thereby	engaging	lots	of	people	,	and	building	visibility	and	engaging	people	in	the	goal	that	's	stated	.
I	'm	going	to	look	quickly	at	the	fourth	and	fifth	categories	,	which	are	innovation	,	competitions	and	social	investing	.
They	're	betting	a	visible	competition	,	a	prize	,	can	attract	talent	and	money	to	some	of	the	most	difficult	issues	,	and	thereby	speed	the	solution	.
This	tackles	yet	another	assumption	,	that	the	giver	and	the	organization	is	at	the	center	,	as	opposed	to	putting	the	problem	at	the	center	.
You	can	look	to	these	innovators	to	help	us	especially	with	things	that	require	technological	or	scientific	solution	.
That	leaves	the	final	category	,	social	investing	,	which	is	really	,	anyway	,	the	biggest	of	them	all	,
represented	here	by	Xigi.net	.
And	this	,	of	course	,	tackles	the	biggest	assumption	of	all	,	that	business	is	business	,	and	philanthropy	is	the	vehicle	of	people	who	want	to	create	change	in	the	world	.
Xigi	is	a	new	community	site	that	's	built	by	the	community	,	linking	and	mapping	this	new	social	capital	market	.
It	lists	already	1,000	entities	that	are	offering	debt	and	equity	for	social	enterprise	.
So	we	can	look	to	these	innovators	to	help	us	remember	that	if	we	can	leverage	even	a	small	amount	of	the	capital	that	seeks	a	return	,	the	good	that	can	be	driven	could	be	astonishing	.
Now	,	what	's	really	interesting	here	is	that	we	're	not	thinking	our	way	into	a	new	way	of	acting	;
we	're	acting	our	way	into	a	new	way	of	thinking	.
Philanthropy	is	reorganizing	itself	before	our	very	eyes	.
And	even	though	all	of	the	experiments	and	all	of	the	big	givers	do	n't	yet	fulfill	this	aspiration	,	I	think	this	is	the	new	zeitgeist	:	open	,	big	,	fast	,	connected	,
and	,	let	us	also	hope	,	long	.
We	have	got	to	realize	that	it	is	going	to	take	a	long	time	to	do	these	things	.
If	we	do	n't	develop	the	stamina	to	stick	with	things	--	whatever	it	is	you	pick	,	stick	with	it	--	all	of	this	stuff	is	just	going	to	be	,	you	know	,	a	fad	.
But	I	'm	really	hopeful	.
And	I	'm	hopeful	because	it	's	not	only	philanthropy	that	's	reorganizing	itself	,
it	's	also	whole	other	portions	of	the	social	sector	,	and	of	business	,	that	are	busy	challenging	``	business	as	usual	.	''
And	everywhere	I	go	,	including	here	at	TED	,	I	feel	that	there	is	a	new	moral	hunger	that	is	growing	.	What	we	're	seeing	is	people	really	wrestling	to	describe	what	is	this	new	thing	that	's	happening	.
Words	like	``	philanthrocapitalism	,	''	and	``	natural	capitalism	,	''	and	``	philanthroentrepreneur	,	''	and	``	venture	philanthropy	.	''
We	do	n't	have	a	language	for	it	yet	.
Whatever	we	call	it	,	it	's	new	,	it	's	beginning	,	and	I	think	it	's	gong	to	quite	significant	.
And	that	's	where	my	imagined	future	comes	in	,
which	I	am	going	to	call	the	social	singularity	.
Many	of	you	will	realize	that	I	'm	ripping	a	bit	off	of	the	science	fiction	writer	Vernor	Vinge	's	notion	of	a	technological	singularity	,	where	a	number	of	trends	accelerate	and	converge	and	come	together	to	create	,	really	,	a	shockingly	new	reality	.
It	may	be	that	the	social	singularity	ahead	is	the	one	that	we	fear	the	most	:
a	convergence	of	catastrophes	,	of	environmental	degradation	,	of	weapons	of	mass	destruction	,	of	pandemics	,	of	poverty	.
That	's	because	our	ability	to	confront	the	problems	that	we	face	has	not	kept	pace	with	our	ability	to	create	them	.
And	as	we	've	heard	here	,	it	is	no	exaggeration	to	say	that	we	hold	the	future	of	our	civilization	in	our	hands	as	never	before	.
The	question	is	,	is	there	a	positive	social	singularity	?
Is	there	a	frontier	for	us	of	how	we	live	together	?
Our	future	does	n't	have	to	be	imagined	.
We	can	create	a	future	where	hope	and	history	rhyme	.
But	we	have	a	problem	.
Our	experience	to	date	,	both	individually	and	collectively	,	has	n't	prepared	us	for	what	we	're	going	to	need	to	do	,	or	who	we	're	going	to	need	to	be	.
We	are	going	to	need	a	new	generation	of	citizen	leaders	willing	to	commit	ourselves	to	growing	and	changing	and	learning	as	rapidly	as	possible	.
That	's	why	I	have	one	last	thing	I	want	to	show	you	.
This	is	a	photograph	taken	about	100	years	ago	of	my	grandfather	and	great-grandfather	.
This	is	a	newspaper	publisher	and	a	banker	.
And	they	were	great	community	leaders	.
And	,	yes	,	they	were	great	philanthropists	.
I	keep	this	photograph	close	by	to	me	--
it	's	in	my	office	--
because	I	've	always	felt	a	mystical	connection	to	these	two	men	,	both	of	whom	I	never	knew	.
And	so	,	in	their	honor	,	I	want	to	offer	you	this	blank	slide	.
And	I	want	you	to	imagine	that	this	a	photograph	of	you	.
And	I	want	you	to	think	about	the	community	that	you	want	to	be	part	of	creating	.	Whatever	that	means	to	you	.
And	I	want	you	to	imagine	that	it	's	100	years	from	now	,	and	your	grandchild	,	or	great-grandchild	,	or	niece	or	nephew	or	god-child	,	is	looking	at	this	photograph	of	you	.
What	is	the	story	you	most	want	for	them	to	tell	?
Thank	you	very	much	.
So	,	how	many	of	you	have	ever	gotten	behind	the	wheel	of	a	car	when	you	really	should	n't	have	been	driving	?
Maybe	you	're	out	on	the	road	for	a	long	day	,	and	you	just	wanted	to	get	home	.
You	were	tired	,	but	you	felt	you	could	drive	a	few	more	miles	.
Maybe	you	thought	,	I	've	had	less	to	drink	than	everybody	else	,	I	should	be	the	one	to	go	home	.
Or	maybe	your	mind	was	just	entirely	elsewhere	.
Does	this	sound	familiar	to	you	?
Now	,	in	those	situations	,	would	n't	it	be	great	if	there	was	a	button	on	your	dashboard	that	you	could	push	,	and	the	car	would	get	you	home	safely	?
Now	,	that	's	been	the	promise	of	the	self-driving	car	,	the	autonomous	vehicle	,	and	it	's	been	the	dream	since	at	least	1939	,	when	General	Motors	showcased	this	idea	at	their	Futurama	booth	at	the	World	's	Fair	.
Now	,	it	's	been	one	of	those	dreams	that	's	always	seemed	about	20	years	in	the	future	.
Now	,	two	weeks	ago	,	that	dream	took	a	step	forward	,	when	the	state	of	Nevada	granted	Google	's	self-driving	car	the	very	first	license	for	an	autonomous	vehicle	,	clearly	establishing	that	it	's	legal	for	them	to	test	it	on	the	roads	in	Nevada	.
Now	,	California	's	considering	similar	legislation	,	and	this	would	make	sure	that	the	autonomous	car	is	not	one	of	those	things	that	has	to	stay	in	Vegas	.
Now	,	in	my	lab	at	Stanford	,	we	've	been	working	on	autonomous	cars	too	,	but	with	a	slightly	different	spin	on	things	.	You	see	,	we	've	been	developing	robotic	race	cars	,	cars	that	can	actually	push	themselves	to	the	very	limits	of	physical	performance	.
Now	,	why	would	we	want	to	do	such	a	thing	?
Well	,	there	's	two	really	good	reasons	for	this	.
First	,	we	believe	that	before	people	turn	over	control	to	an	autonomous	car	,	that	autonomous	car	should	be	at	least	as	good	as	the	very	best	human	drivers	.
Now	,	if	you	're	like	me	,	and	the	other	70	percent	of	the	population	who	know	that	we	are	above-average	drivers	,	you	understand	that	's	a	very	high	bar	.
There	's	another	reason	as	well	.
Just	like	race	car	drivers	can	use	all	of	the	friction	between	the	tire	and	the	road	,	all	of	the	car	's	capabilities	to	go	as	fast	as	possible	,	we	want	to	use	all	of	those	capabilities	to	avoid	any	accident	we	can	.
Now	,	you	may	push	the	car	to	the	limits	not	because	you	're	driving	too	fast	,	but	because	you	've	hit	an	icy	patch	of	road	,	conditions	have	changed	.
In	those	situations	,	we	want	a	car	that	is	capable	enough	to	avoid	any	accident	that	can	physically	be	avoided	.
I	must	confess	,	there	's	kind	of	a	third	motivation	as	well	.
You	see	,	I	have	a	passion	for	racing	.
In	the	past	,	I	've	been	a	race	car	owner	,	a	crew	chief	and	a	driving	coach	,	although	maybe	not	at	the	level	that	you	're	currently	expecting	.
One	of	the	things	that	we	've	developed	in	the	lab	--	we	've	developed	several	vehicles	--	is	what	we	believe	is	the	world	's	first	autonomously	drifting	car	.
It	's	another	one	of	those	categories	where	maybe	there	's	not	a	lot	of	competition	.
But	this	is	P1	.	It	's	an	entirely	student-built	electric	vehicle	,	which	through	using	its	rear-wheel	drive	and	front-wheel	steer-by-wire	can	drift	around	corners	.
It	can	get	sideways	like	a	rally	car	driver	,	always	able	to	take	the	tightest	curve	,	even	on	slippery	,	changing	surfaces	,	never	spinning	out	.
We	've	also	worked	with	Volkswagen	Oracle	,	on	Shelley	,	an	autonomous	race	car	that	has	raced	at	150	miles	an	hour	through	the	Bonneville	Salt	Flats	,	gone	around	Thunderhill	Raceway	Park	in	the	sun	,	the	wind	and	the	rain	,	and	navigated	the	153	turns	and	12.4	miles	of	the	Pikes	Peak	Hill	Climb	route	in	Colorado	with	nobody	at	the	wheel	.
I	guess	it	goes	without	saying	that	we	've	had	a	lot	of	fun	doing	this	.
But	in	fact	,	there	's	something	else	that	we	've	developed	in	the	process	of	developing	these	autonomous	cars	.
We	have	developed	a	tremendous	appreciation	for	the	capabilities	of	human	race	car	drivers	.
As	we	've	looked	at	the	question	of	how	well	do	these	cars	perform	,	we	wanted	to	compare	them	to	our	human	counterparts	.
And	we	discovered	their	human	counterparts	are	amazing	.
Now	,	we	can	take	a	map	of	a	race	track	,	we	can	take	a	mathematical	model	of	a	car	,	and	with	some	iteration	,	we	can	actually	find	the	fastest	way	around	that	track	.
We	line	that	up	with	data	that	we	record	from	a	professional	driver	,	and	the	resemblance	is	absolutely	remarkable	.
Yes	,	there	are	subtle	differences	here	,	but	the	human	race	car	driver	is	able	to	go	out	and	drive	an	amazingly	fast	line	,	without	the	benefit	of	an	algorithm	that	compares	the	trade-off	between	going	as	fast	as	possible	in	this	corner	,	and	shaving	a	little	bit	of	time	off	of	the	straight	over	here	.
Not	only	that	,	they	're	able	to	do	it	lap	after	lap	after	lap	.
They	're	able	to	go	out	and	consistently	do	this	,	pushing	the	car	to	the	limits	every	single	time	.
It	's	extraordinary	to	watch	.
You	put	them	in	a	new	car	,	and	after	a	few	laps	,	they	've	found	the	fastest	line	in	that	car	,	and	they	're	off	to	the	races	.
It	really	makes	you	think	,	we	'd	love	to	know	what	's	going	on	inside	their	brain	.
So	as	researchers	,	that	's	what	we	decided	to	find	out	.
We	decided	to	instrument	not	only	the	car	,	but	also	the	race	car	driver	,	to	try	to	get	a	glimpse	into	what	was	going	on	in	their	head	as	they	were	doing	this	.
Now	,	this	is	Dr.	Lene	Harbott	applying	electrodes	to	the	head	of	John	Morton	.
John	Morton	is	a	former	Can-Am	and	IMSA	driver	,	who	's	also	a	class	champion	at	Le	Mans	.
Fantastic	driver	,	and	very	willing	to	put	up	with	graduate	students	and	this	sort	of	research	.
She	's	putting	electrodes	on	his	head	so	that	we	can	monitor	the	electrical	activity	in	John	's	brain	as	he	races	around	the	track	.
Now	,	clearly	we	're	not	going	to	put	a	couple	of	electrodes	on	his	head	and	understand	exactly	what	all	of	his	thoughts	are	on	the	track	.
However	,	neuroscientists	have	identified	certain	patterns	that	let	us	tease	out	some	very	important	aspects	of	this	.
For	instance	,	the	resting	brain	tends	to	generate	a	lot	of	alpha	waves	.
In	contrast	,	theta	waves	are	associated	with	a	lot	of	cognitive	activity	,	like	visual	processing	,	things	where	the	driver	is	thinking	quite	a	bit	.
Now	,	we	can	measure	this	,	and	we	can	look	at	the	relative	power	between	the	theta	waves	and	the	alpha	waves	.
This	gives	us	a	measure	of	mental	workload	,	how	much	the	driver	is	actually	challenged	cognitively	at	any	point	along	the	track	.
Now	,	we	wanted	to	see	if	we	could	actually	record	this	on	the	track	,	so	we	headed	down	south	to	Laguna	Seca	.
Laguna	Seca	is	a	legendary	raceway	about	halfway	between	Salinas	and	Monterey	.
It	has	a	curve	there	called	the	Corkscrew	.
Now	,	the	Corkscrew	is	a	chicane	,	followed	by	a	quick	right-handed	turn	as	the	road	drops	three	stories	.
Now	,	the	strategy	for	driving	this	as	explained	to	me	was	,	you	aim	for	the	bush	in	the	distance	,	and	as	the	road	falls	away	,	you	realize	it	was	actually	the	top	of	a	tree	.
All	right	,	so	thanks	to	the	Revs	Program	at	Stanford	,	we	were	able	to	take	John	there	and	put	him	behind	the	wheel	of	a	1960	Porsche	Abarth	Carrera	.
Life	is	way	too	short	for	boring	cars	.
So	,	here	you	see	John	on	the	track	,	he	's	going	up	the	hill	--	Oh	!	Somebody	liked	that	--	and	you	can	see	,	actually	,	his	mental	workload	--	measuring	here	in	the	red	bar	--	you	can	see	his	actions	as	he	approaches	.
Now	watch	,	he	has	to	downshift	.
And	then	he	has	to	turn	left	.
Look	for	the	tree	,	and	down	.
Not	surprisingly	,	you	can	see	this	is	a	pretty	challenging	task	.
You	can	see	his	mental	workload	spike	as	he	goes	through	this	,	as	you	would	expect	with	something	that	requires	this	level	of	complexity	.
But	what	's	really	interesting	is	to	look	at	areas	of	the	track	where	his	mental	workload	does	n't	increase	.
I	'm	going	to	take	you	around	now	to	the	other	side	of	the	track	.
Turn	three	.	And	John	's	going	to	go	into	that	corner	and	the	rear	end	of	the	car	is	going	to	begin	to	slide	out	.
He	's	going	to	have	to	correct	for	that	with	steering	.
So	watch	as	John	does	this	here	.
Watch	the	mental	workload	,	and	watch	the	steering	.
The	car	begins	to	slide	out	,	dramatic	maneuver	to	correct	it	,	and	no	change	whatsoever	in	the	mental	workload	.
Not	a	challenging	task	.
In	fact	,	entirely	reflexive	.
Now	,	our	data	processing	on	this	is	still	preliminary	,	but	it	really	seems	that	these	phenomenal	feats	that	the	race	car	drivers	are	performing	are	instinctive	.
They	are	things	that	they	have	simply	learned	to	do	.
It	requires	very	little	mental	workload	for	them	to	perform	these	amazing	feats	.
And	their	actions	are	fantastic	.
This	is	exactly	what	you	want	to	do	on	the	steering	wheel	to	catch	the	car	in	this	situation	.
Now	,	this	has	given	us	tremendous	insight	and	inspiration	for	our	own	autonomous	vehicles	.
We	've	started	to	ask	the	question	:	Can	we	make	them	a	little	less	algorithmic	and	a	little	more	intuitive	?
Can	we	take	this	reflexive	action	that	we	see	from	the	very	best	race	car	drivers	,	introduce	it	to	our	cars	,	and	maybe	even	into	a	system	that	could	get	onto	your	car	in	the	future	?
That	would	take	us	a	long	step	along	the	road	to	autonomous	vehicles	that	drive	as	well	as	the	best	humans	.
But	it	's	made	us	think	a	little	bit	more	deeply	as	well	.
Do	we	want	something	more	from	our	car	than	to	simply	be	a	chauffeur	?
Do	we	want	our	car	to	perhaps	be	a	partner	,	a	coach	,	someone	that	can	use	their	understanding	of	the	situation	to	help	us	reach	our	potential	?
Can	,	in	fact	,	the	technology	not	simply	replace	humans	,	but	allow	us	to	reach	the	level	of	reflex	and	intuition	that	we	're	all	capable	of	?
So	,	as	we	move	forward	into	this	technological	future	,	I	want	you	to	just	pause	and	think	of	that	for	a	moment	.
What	is	the	ideal	balance	of	human	and	machine	?
And	as	we	think	about	that	,	let	's	take	inspiration	from	the	absolutely	amazing	capabilities	of	the	human	body	and	the	human	mind	.
Thank	you	.
I	believe	that	there	are	new	,	hidden	tensions	that	are	actually	happening	between	people	and	institutions	--	institutions	that	are	the	institutions	that	people	inhabit	in	their	daily	life	:	schools	,	hospitals	,	workplaces	,	factories	,	offices	,	etc	.
And	something	that	I	see	happening	is	something	that	I	would	like	to	call	a	sort	of	``	democratization	of	intimacy	.	''
And	what	do	I	mean	by	that	?
I	mean	that	what	people	are	doing	is	,	in	fact	,	they	are	sort	of	,	with	their	communication	channels	,	they	are	breaking	an	imposed	isolation	that	these	institutions	are	imposing	on	them	.
How	are	they	doing	this	?	They	're	doing	it	in	a	very	simple	way	,	by	calling	their	mom	from	work	,	by	IMing	from	their	office	to	their	friends	,	by	texting	under	the	desk	.
The	pictures	that	you	're	seeing	behind	me	are	people	that	I	visited	in	the	last	few	months	.
And	I	asked	them	to	come	along	with	the	person	they	communicate	with	most	.
And	somebody	brought	a	boyfriend	,	somebody	a	father	.
One	young	woman	brought	her	grandfather	.
For	20	years	,	I	've	been	looking	at	how	people	use	channels	such	as	email	,	the	mobile	phone	,	texting	,	etc	.	What	we	're	actually	going	to	see	is	that	,	fundamentally	,	people	are	communicating	on	a	regular	basis	with	five	,	six	,	seven	of	their	most	intimate	sphere	.
Now	,	lets	take	some	data	.	Facebook	.
Recently	some	sociologists	from	Facebook	--	Facebook	is	the	channel	that	you	would	expect	is	the	most	enlargening	of	all	channels	.
And	an	average	user	,	said	Cameron	Marlow	,	from	Facebook	,	has	about	120	friends	.
But	he	actually	talks	to	,	has	two-way	exchanges	with	,	about	four	to	six	people	on	a	regular	base	,	depending	on	his	gender	.
Academic	research	on	instant	messaging	also	shows	100	people	on	buddy	lists	,	but	fundamentally	people	chat	with	two	,	three	,	four	--	anyway	,	less	than	five	.
My	own	research	on	cellphones	and	voice	calls	shows	that	80	percent	of	the	calls	are	actually	made	to	four	people	.	80	percent	.
And	when	you	go	to	Skype	,	it	's	down	to	two	people	.
A	lot	of	sociologists	actually	are	quite	disappointed	.
I	mean	,	I	've	been	a	bit	disappointed	sometimes	when	I	saw	this	data	and	all	this	deployment	,	just	for	five	people	.
And	some	sociologists	actually	feel	that	it	's	a	closure	,	it	's	a	cocooning	,	that	we	're	disengaging	from	the	public	.
And	I	would	actually	,	I	would	like	to	show	you	that	if	we	actually	look	at	who	is	doing	it	,	and	from	where	they	're	doing	it	,	actually	there	is	an	incredible	social	transformation	.
There	are	three	stories	that	I	think	are	quite	good	examples	.
The	first	gentleman	,	he	's	a	baker	.	And	so	he	starts	working	every	morning	at	four	o'clock	in	the	morning	.
And	around	eight	o'clock	he	sort	of	sneaks	away	from	his	oven	,	cleans	his	hands	from	the	flour	and	calls	his	wife	.
He	just	wants	to	wish	her	a	good	day	,	because	that	's	the	start	of	her	day	.
And	I	've	heard	this	story	a	number	of	times	.
A	young	factory	worker	who	works	night	shifts	,	who	manages	to	sneak	away	from	the	factory	floor	,	where	there	is	CCTV	by	the	way	,	and	find	a	corner	,	where	at	11	o'clock	at	night	he	can	call	his	girlfriend	and	just	say	goodnight	.
Or	a	mother	who	,	at	four	o'clock	,	suddenly	manages	to	find	a	corner	in	the	toilet	to	check	that	her	children	are	safely	home	.
Then	there	is	another	couple	,	there	is	a	Brazilian	couple	.
They	've	lived	in	Italy	for	a	number	of	years	.
They	Skype	with	their	families	a	few	times	a	week	.
But	once	a	fortnight	,	they	actually	put	the	computer	on	their	dining	table	,	pull	out	the	webcam	and	actually	have	dinner	with	their	family	in	Sao	Paulo	.	And	they	have	a	big	event	of	it	.
And	I	heard	this	story	the	first	time	a	couple	of	years	ago	from	a	very	modest	family	of	immigrants	from	Kosovo	in	Switzerland	.
They	had	set	up	a	big	screen	in	their	living	room	,
and	every	morning	they	had	breakfast	with	their	grandmother	.
But	Danny	Miller	,	who	is	a	very	good	anthropologist	who	is	working	on	Filipina	migrant	women	who	leave	their	children	back	in	the	Philippines	,	was	telling	me	about	how	much	parenting	is	going	on	through	Skype	,	and	how	much	these	mothers	are	engaged	with	their	children	through	Skype	.
And	then	there	is	the	third	couple	.	They	are	two	friends	.
They	chat	to	each	other	every	day	,	a	few	times	a	day	actually	.
And	finally	,	finally	,	they	've	managed	to	put	instant	messaging	on	their	computers	at	work	.
And	now	,	obviously	,	they	have	it	open	.
Whenever	they	have	a	moment	they	chat	to	each	other	.
And	this	is	exactly	what	we	've	been	seeing	with	teenagers	and	kids	doing	it	in	school	,	under	the	table	,	and	texting	under	the	table	to	their	friends	.
So	,	none	of	these	cases	are	unique	.
I	mean	,	I	could	tell	you	hundreds	of	them	.
But	what	is	really	exceptional	is	the	setting	.
So	,	think	of	the	three	settings	I	've	talked	to	you	about	:	factory	,	migration	,	office	.
But	it	could	be	in	a	school	,	it	could	be	an	administration	,	it	could	be	a	hospital	.
Three	settings	that	,	if	we	just	step	back	15	years	,	if	you	just	think	back	15	years	,	when	you	clocked	in	,	when	you	clocked	in	to	an	office	,	when	you	clocked	in	to	a	factory	,	there	was	no	contact	for	the	whole	duration	of	the	time	,	there	was	no	contact	with	your	private	sphere	.
If	you	were	lucky	there	was	a	public	phone	hanging	in	the	corridor	or	somewhere	.
If	you	were	in	management	,	oh	,	that	was	a	different	story	.
Maybe	you	had	a	direct	line	.
If	you	were	not	,	you	maybe	had	to	go	through	an	operator	.
But	basically	,	when	you	walked	into	those	buildings	,	the	private	sphere	was	left	behind	you	.
And	this	has	become	such	a	norm	of	our	professional	lives	,	such	a	norm	and	such	an	expectation	.
And	it	had	nothing	to	do	with	technical	capability	.
The	phones	were	there	.	But	the	expectation	was	once	you	moved	in	there	your	commitment	was	fully	to	the	task	at	hand	,	fully	to	the	people	around	you	.
That	was	where	the	focus	had	to	be	.
And	this	has	become	such	a	cultural	norm	that	we	actually	school	our	children	for	them	to	be	capable	to	do	this	cleavage	.
If	you	think	nursery	,	kindergarten	,	first	years	of	school	are	just	dedicated	to	take	away	the	children	,	to	make	them	used	to	staying	long	hours	away	from	their	family	.
And	then	the	school	enacts	perfectly	well	.	It	mimics	perfectly	all	the	rituals	that	we	will	find	in	offices	:	rituals	of	entry	,	rituals	of	exit	,	the	schedules	,	the	uniforms	in	this	country	,	things	that	identify	you	,	team-building	activities	,
team	building	that	will	allow	you	to	basically	be	with	a	random	group	of	kids	,	or	a	random	group	of	people	that	you	will	have	to	be	with	for	a	number	of	time	.
And	of	course	,	the	major	thing	:	learn	to	pay	attention	,	to	concentrate	and	focus	your	attention	.
This	only	started	about	150	years	ago	.
It	only	started	with	the	birth	of	modern	bureaucracy	,	and	of	industrial	revolution	.
When	people	basically	had	to	go	somewhere	else	to	work	and	carry	out	the	work	.
And	when	with	modern	bureaucracy	there	was	a	very	rational	approach	,	where	there	was	a	clear	distinction	between	the	private	sphere	and	the	public	sphere	.
So	,	until	then	,	basically	people	were	living	on	top	of	their	trades	.
They	were	living	on	top	of	the	land	they	were	laboring	.
They	were	living	on	top	of	the	workshops	where	they	were	working	.
And	if	you	think	,	it	's	permeated	our	whole	culture	,	even	our	cities	.
If	you	think	of	medieval	cities	,	medieval	cities	the	boroughs	all	have	the	names	of	the	guilds	and	professions	that	lived	there	.
Now	we	have	sprawling	residential	suburbias	that	are	well	distinct	from	production	areas	and	commercial	areas	.
And	actually	,	over	these	150	years	,	there	has	been	a	very	clear	class	system	that	also	has	emerged	.
So	the	lower	the	status	of	the	job	and	of	the	person	carrying	out	,	the	more	removed	he	would	be	from	his	personal	sphere	.
People	have	taken	this	amazing	possibility	of	actually	being	in	contact	all	through	the	day	or	in	all	types	of	situations	.
And	they	are	doing	it	massively	.
The	Pew	Institute	,	which	produces	good	data	on	a	regular	basis	on	,	for	instance	,	in	the	States	,	says	that	--	and	I	think	that	this	number	is	conservative	--	50	percent	of	anybody	with	email	access	at	work	is	actually	doing	private	email	from	his	office	.
I	really	think	that	the	number	is	conservative	.
In	my	own	research	,	we	saw	that	the	peak	for	private	email	is	actually	11	o'clock	in	the	morning	,	whatever	the	country	.
75	percent	of	people	admit	doing	private	conversations	from	work	on	their	mobile	phones	.
100	percent	are	using	text	.
The	point	is	that	this	re-appropriation	of	the	personal	sphere	is	not	terribly	successful	with	all	institutions	.
I	'm	always	surprised	the	U.S.	Army	sociologists	are	discussing	of	the	impact	for	instance	,	of	soldiers	in	Iraq	having	daily	contact	with	their	families	.
But	there	are	many	institutions	that	are	actually	blocking	this	access	.
And	every	day	,	every	single	day	,	I	read	news	that	makes	me	cringe	,	like	a	$	15	fine	to	kids	in	Texas	,	for	using	,	every	time	they	take	out	their	mobile	phone	in	school	.
Immediate	dismissal	to	bus	drivers	in	New	York	,	if	seen	with	a	mobile	phone	in	a	hand	.
Companies	blocking	access	to	IM	or	to	Facebook	.
Behind	issues	of	security	and	safety	,	which	have	always	been	the	arguments	for	social	control	,	in	fact	what	is	going	on	is	that	these	institutions	are	trying	to	decide	who	,	in	fact	,	has	a	right	to	self	determine	their	attention	,	to	decide	,	whether	they	should	,	or	not	,	be	isolated	.
And	they	are	actually	trying	to	block	,	in	a	certain	sense	,	this	movement	of	a	greater	possibility	of	intimacy	.
So	today	,	I	'm	going	to	tell	you	about	some	people	who	did	n't	move	out	of	their	neighborhoods	.
The	first	one	is	happening	right	here	in	Chicago	.
Brenda	Palms-Farber	was	hired	to	help	ex-convicts	reenter	society	and	keep	them	from	going	back	into	prison	.
Currently	,	taxpayers	spend	about	60,000	dollars	per	year	sending	a	person	to	jail	.
We	know	that	two-thirds	of	them	are	going	to	go	back	.
I	find	it	interesting	that	,	for	every	one	dollar	we	spend	,	however	,	on	early	childhood	education	,	like	Head	Start	,	we	save	17	dollars	on	stuff	like	incarceration	in	the	future	.
Or	--	think	about	it	--	that	60,000	dollars	is	more	than	what	it	costs	to	send	one	person	to	Harvard	as	well	.
But	Brenda	,	not	being	phased	by	stuff	like	that	,	took	a	look	at	her	challenge	and	came	up	with	a	not-so-obvious	solution	:	create	a	business	that	produces	skin	care	products	from	honey	.
Okay	,	it	might	be	obvious	to	some	of	you	;	it	was	n't	to	me	.
It	's	the	basis	of	growing	a	form	of	social	innovation	that	has	real	potential	.
She	hired	seemingly	unemployable	men	and	women	to	care	for	the	bees	,	harvest	the	honey	and	make	value-added	products	that	they	marketed	themselves	,	and	that	were	later	sold	at	Whole	Foods	.
She	combined	employment	experience	and	training	with	life	skills	they	needed	,	like	anger-management	and	teamwork	,	and	also	how	to	talk	to	future	employers	about	how	their	experiences	actually	demonstrated	the	lessons	that	they	had	learned	and	their	eagerness	to	learn	more	.
Less	than	four	percent	of	the	folks	that	went	through	her	program	actually	go	back	to	jail	.
So	these	young	men	and	women	learned	job-readiness	and	life	skills	through	bee	keeping	and	became	productive	citizens	in	the	process	.
Talk	about	a	sweet	beginning	.
Now	,	I	'm	going	to	take	you	to	Los	Angeles	,
and	lots	of	people	know	that	L.A.	has	its	issues	.
But	I	'm	going	to	talk	about	L.A.	's	water	issues	right	now	.
They	have	not	enough	water	on	most	days	and	too	much	to	handle	when	it	rains	.
Currently	,	20	percent	of	California	's	energy	consumption	is	used	to	pump	water	into	mostly	Southern	California	.
Their	spending	loads	,	loads	,	to	channel	that	rainwater	out	into	the	ocean	when	it	rains	and	floods	as	well	.
Now	Andy	Lipkis	is	working	to	help	L.A.	cut	infrastructure	costs	associated	with	water	management	and	urban	heat	island	--	linking	trees	,	people	and	technology	to	create	a	more	livable	city	.
All	that	green	stuff	actually	naturally	absorbs	storm	water	,	also	helps	cool	our	cities	.
Because	,	come	to	think	about	it	,	do	you	really	want	air-conditioning	,	or	is	it	a	cooler	room	that	you	want	?
How	you	get	it	should	n't	make	that	much	of	a	difference	.
So	a	few	years	ago	,	L.A.	County	decided	that	they	needed	to	spend	2.5	billion	dollars	to	repair	the	city	schools	.
And	Andy	and	his	team	discovered	that	they	were	going	to	spend	200	million	of	those	dollars	on	asphalt	to	surround	the	schools	themselves	.
And	by	presenting	a	really	strong	economic	case	,	they	convinced	the	L.A.	government	that	replacing	that	asphalt	with	trees	and	other	greenery	,	that	the	schools	themselves	would	save	the	system	more	on	energy	than	they	spend	on	horticultural	infrastructure	.
So	ultimately	,	20	million	square	feet	of	asphalt	was	replaced	or	avoided	,	and	electrical	consumption	for	air-conditioning	went	down	,	while	employment	for	people	to	maintain	those	grounds	went	up	,	resulting	in	a	net-savings	to	the	system	,	but	also	healthier	students	and	schools	system	employees	as	well	.
Now	Judy	Bonds	is	a	coal	miner	's	daughter	.
Her	family	has	eight	generations	in	a	town	called	Whitesville	,	West	Virginia	.
And	if	anyone	should	be	clinging	to	the	former	glory	of	the	coal	mining	history	,	and	of	the	town	,	it	should	be	Judy	.
But	the	way	coal	is	mined	right	now	is	different	from	the	deep	mines	that	her	father	and	her	father	's	father	would	go	down	into	and	that	employed	essentially	thousands	and	thousands	of	people	.
Now	,	two	dozen	men	can	tear	down	a	mountain	in	several	months	,	and	only	for	about	a	few	years	'	worth	of	coal	.
That	kind	of	technology	is	called	``	mountaintop	removal	.	''
It	can	make	a	mountain	go	from	this	to	this	in	a	few	short	months	.
Just	imagine	that	the	air	surrounding	these	places	--	it	's	filled	with	the	residue	of	explosives	and	coal	.
When	we	visited	,	it	gave	some	of	the	people	we	were	with	this	strange	little	cough	after	being	only	there	for	just	a	few	hours	or	so	--	not	just	miners	,	but	everybody	.
And	Judy	saw	her	landscape	being	destroyed	and	her	water	poisoned	.
And	the	coal	companies	just	move	on	after	the	mountain	was	emptied	,	leaving	even	more	unemployment	in	their	wake	.
But	she	also	saw	the	difference	in	potential	wind	energy	on	an	intact	mountain	,	and	one	that	was	reduced	in	elevation	by	over	2,000	feet	.
Three	years	of	dirty	energy	with	not	many	jobs	,	or	centuries	of	clean	energy	with	the	potential	for	developing	expertise	and	improvements	in	efficiency	based	on	technical	skills	,	and	developing	local	knowledge	about	how	to	get	the	most	out	of	that	region	's	wind	.
She	calculated	the	up-front	cost	and	the	payback	over	time	,	and	it	's	a	net-plus	on	so	many	levels	for	the	local	,	national	and	global	economy	.
It	's	a	longer	payback	than	mountaintop	removal	,	but	the	wind	energy	actually	pays	back	forever	.
Now	mountaintop	removal	pays	very	little	money	to	the	locals	,	and	it	gives	them	a	lot	of	misery	.
The	water	is	turned	into	goo	.
Most	people	are	still	unemployed	,	leading	to	most	of	the	same	kinds	of	social	problems	that	unemployed	people	in	inner	cities	also	experience	--	drug	and	alcohol	abuse	,	domestic	abuse	,	teen	pregnancy	and	poor	heath	,	as	well	.
Now	Judy	and	I	--	I	have	to	say	--	totally	related	to	each	other	.
Not	quite	an	obvious	alliance	.
I	mean	,	literally	,	her	hometown	is	called	Whitesville	,	West	Virginia	.
I	mean	,	they	are	not	--	they	ai	n't	competing	for	the	birthplace	of	hip	hop	title	or	anything	like	that	.
But	the	back	of	my	T-shirt	,	the	one	that	she	gave	me	,	says	,	``	Save	the	endangered	hillbillies	.	''
So	homegirls	and	hillbillies	we	got	it	together	and	totally	understand	that	this	is	what	it	's	all	about	.
But	just	a	few	months	ago	,	Judy	was	diagnosed	with	stage-three	lung	cancer	.
Yeah	.
And	it	has	since	moved	to	her	bones	and	her	brain	.
And	I	just	find	it	so	bizarre	that	she	's	suffering	from	the	same	thing	that	she	tried	so	hard	to	protect	people	from	.
But	her	dream	of	Coal	River	Mountain	Wind	is	her	legacy	.
And	she	might	not	get	to	see	that	mountaintop	.
But	rather	than	writing	yet	some	kind	of	manifesto	or	something	,	she	's	leaving	behind	a	business	plan	to	make	it	happen	.
That	's	what	my	homegirl	is	doing	.
So	I	'm	so	proud	of	that	.
But	these	three	people	do	n't	know	each	other	,	but	they	do	have	an	awful	lot	in	common	.
They	're	all	problem	solvers	,	and	they	're	just	some	of	the	many	examples	that	I	really	am	privileged	to	see	,	meet	and	learn	from	in	the	examples	of	the	work	that	I	do	now	.
I	was	really	lucky	to	have	them	all	featured	on	my	Corporation	for	Public	Radio	radio	show	called	ThePromisedLand.org	.
Now	they	're	all	very	practical	visionaries	.
They	take	a	look	at	the	demands	that	are	out	there	--	beauty	products	,	healthy	schools	,	electricity	--	and	how	the	money	's	flowing	to	meet	those	demands	.
And	when	the	cheapest	solutions	involve	reducing	the	number	of	jobs	,	you	're	left	with	unemployed	people	,	and	those	people	are	n't	cheap	.
In	fact	,	they	make	up	some	of	what	I	call	the	most	expensive	citizens	,	and	they	include	generationally	impoverished	,	traumatized	vets	returning	from	the	Middle	East	,	people	coming	out	of	jail	.
And	for	the	veterans	in	particular	,	the	V.A	.	said	there	's	a	six-fold	increase	in	mental	health	pharmaceuticals	by	vets	since	2003	.
I	think	that	number	's	probably	going	to	go	up	.
They	're	not	the	largest	number	of	people	,	but	they	are	some	of	the	most	expensive	--
and	in	terms	of	the	likelihood	for	domestic	abuse	,	drug	and	alcohol	abuse	,	poor	performance	by	their	kids	in	schools	and	also	poor	health	as	a	result	of	stress	.
So	these	three	guys	all	understand	how	to	productively	channel	dollars	through	our	local	economies	to	meet	existing	market	demands	,	reduce	the	social	problems	that	we	have	now	and	prevent	new	problems	in	the	future	.
And	there	are	plenty	of	other	examples	like	that	.
One	problem	:	waste	handling	and	unemployment	.
Even	when	we	think	or	talk	about	recycling	,	lots	of	recyclable	stuff	ends	up	getting	incinerated	or	in	landfills	and	leaving	many	municipalities	,	diversion	rates	--	they	leave	much	to	be	recycled	.
And	where	is	this	waste	handled	?	Usually	in	poor	communities	.
And	we	know	that	eco-industrial	business	,	these	kinds	of	business	models	--	there	's	a	model	in	Europe	called	the	eco-industrial	park	,	where	either	the	waste	of	one	company	is	the	raw	material	for	another	,	or	you	use	recycled	materials	to	make	goods	that	you	can	actually	use	and	sell	.
We	can	create	these	local	markets	and	incentives	for	recycled	materials	to	be	used	as	raw	materials	for	manufacturing	.
And	in	my	hometown	,	we	actually	tried	to	do	one	of	these	in	the	Bronx	,	but	our	mayor	decided	what	he	wanted	to	see	was	a	jail	on	that	same	spot	.
Fortunately	--	because	we	wanted	to	create	hundreds	of	jobs	--	but	after	many	years	,	the	city	wanted	to	build	a	jail	.	They	've	since	abandoned	that	project	,	thank	goodness	.
Another	problem	:	unhealthy	food	systems	and	unemployment	.
Working-class	and	poor	urban	Americans	are	not	benefiting	economically	from	our	current	food	system	.
It	relies	too	much	on	transportation	,	chemical	fertilization	,	big	use	of	water	and	also	refrigeration	.
Mega	agricultural	operations	often	are	responsible	for	poisoning	our	waterways	and	our	land	,	and	it	produces	this	incredibly	unhealthy	product	that	costs	us	billions	in	healthcare	and	lost	productivity	.
And	so	we	know	``	urban	ag	''	is	a	big	buzz	topic	this	time	of	the	year	,	but	it	's	mostly	gardening	,	which	has	some	value	in	community	building	--	lots	of	it	--	but	it	's	not	in	terms	of	creating	jobs	or	for	food	production	.
The	numbers	just	are	n't	there	.
Part	of	my	work	now	is	really	laying	the	groundwork	to	integrate	urban	ag	and	rural	food	systems	to	hasten	the	demise	of	the	3,000-mile	salad	by	creating	a	national	brand	of	urban-grown	produce	in	every	city	,	that	uses	regional	growing	power	and	augments	it	with	indoor	growing	facilities	,	owned	and	operated	by	small	growers	,	where	now	there	are	only	consumers	.
This	can	support	seasonal	farmers	around	metro	areas	who	are	losing	out	because	they	really	ca	n't	meet	the	year-round	demand	for	produce	.
It	's	not	a	competition	with	rural	farm	;	it	's	actually	reinforcements	.
It	allies	in	a	really	positive	and	economically	viable	food	system	.
The	goal	is	to	meet	the	cities	'	institutional	demands	for	hospitals	,	senior	centers	,	schools	,	daycare	centers	,	and	produce	a	network	of	regional	jobs	,	as	well	.
This	is	smart	infrastructure	.
And	how	we	manage	our	built	environment	affects	the	health	and	well-being	of	people	every	single	day	.
Our	municipalities	,	rural	and	urban	,	play	the	operational	course	of	infrastructure	--	things	like	waste	disposal	,	energy	demand	,	as	well	as	social	costs	of	unemployment	,	drop-out	rates	,	incarceration	rates	and	the	impacts	of	various	public	health	costs	.
Smart	infrastructure	can	provide	cost-saving	ways	for	municipalities	to	handle	both	infrastructure	and	social	needs	.
And	we	want	to	shift	the	systems	that	open	the	doors	for	people	who	were	formerly	tax	burdens	to	become	part	of	the	tax	base	.
And	imagine	a	national	business	model	that	creates	local	jobs	and	smart	infrastructure	to	improve	local	economic	stability	.
So	I	'm	hoping	you	can	see	a	little	theme	here	.
These	examples	indicate	a	trend	.
I	have	n't	created	it	,	and	it	's	not	happening	by	accident	.
I	'm	noticing	that	it	's	happening	all	over	the	country	,	and	the	good	news	is	that	it	's	growing	.
And	we	all	need	to	be	invested	in	it	.
It	is	an	essential	pillar	to	this	country	's	recovery	.
And	I	call	it	``	hometown	security	.	''
The	recession	has	us	reeling	and	fearful	,	and	there	's	something	in	the	air	these	days	that	is	also	very	empowering	.
It	's	a	realization	that	we	are	the	key	to	our	own	recovery	.
Now	is	the	time	for	us	to	act	in	our	own	communities	where	we	think	local	and	we	act	local	.
And	when	we	do	that	,	our	neighbors	--	be	they	next-door	,	or	in	the	next	state	,	or	in	the	next	country	--	will	be	just	fine	.
The	sum	of	the	local	is	the	global	.
Hometown	security	means	rebuilding	our	natural	defenses	,	putting	people	to	work	,	restoring	our	natural	systems	.
Hometown	security	means	creating	wealth	here	at	home	,	instead	of	destroying	it	overseas	.	Tackling	social	and	environmental	problems	at	the	same	time	with	the	same	solution	yields	great	cost	savings	,	wealth	generation	and	national	security	.
Many	great	and	inspiring	solutions	have	been	generated	across	America	.
The	challenge	for	us	now	is	to	identify	and	support	countless	more	.
Now	,	hometown	security	is	about	taking	care	of	your	own	,	but	it	's	not	like	the	old	saying	,	``	charity	begins	at	home	.	''
I	recently	read	a	book	called	``	Love	Leadership	''	by	John	Hope	Bryant	.
And	it	's	about	leading	in	a	world	that	really	does	seem	to	be	operating	on	the	basis	of	fear	.
And	reading	that	book	made	me	reexamine	that	theory	because	I	need	to	explain	what	I	mean	by	that	.
See	,	my	dad	was	a	great	,	great	man	in	many	ways	.
He	grew	up	in	the	segregated	South	,	escaped	lynching	and	all	that	during	some	really	hard	times	,	and	he	provided	a	really	stable	home	for	me	and	my	siblings	and	a	whole	bunch	of	other	people	that	fell	on	hard	times	.
But	,	like	all	of	us	,	he	had	some	problems	.
And	his	was	gambling	,	compulsively	.
To	him	that	phrase	,	``	Charity	begins	at	home	,	''	meant	that	my	payday	--	or	someone	else	's	--	would	just	happen	to	coincide	with	his	lucky	day	.
So	you	need	to	help	him	out	.
And	sometimes	I	would	loan	him	money	from	my	after-school	or	summer	jobs	,	and	he	always	had	the	great	intention	of	paying	me	back	with	interest	,	of	course	,	after	he	hit	it	big	.
And	he	did	sometimes	,	believe	it	or	not	,	at	a	racetrack	in	Los	Angeles	--	one	reason	to	love	L.A.	--	back	in	the	1940s	.
He	made	15,000	dollars	cash	and	bought	the	house	that	I	grew	up	in	.
So	I	'm	not	that	unhappy	about	that	.
But	listen	,	I	did	feel	obligated	to	him	,	and	I	grew	up	--	then	I	grew	up	.
And	I	'm	a	grown	woman	now	,
and	I	have	learned	a	few	things	along	the	way	.
To	me	,	charity	often	is	just	about	giving	,	because	you	're	supposed	to	,	or	because	it	's	what	you	've	always	done	,	or	it	's	about	giving	until	it	hurts	.
I	'm	about	providing	the	means	to	build	something	that	will	grow	and	intensify	its	original	investment	and	not	just	require	greater	giving	next	year	--	I	'm	not	trying	to	feed	the	habit	.
I	spent	some	years	watching	how	good	intentions	for	community	empowerment	,	that	were	supposed	to	be	there	to	support	the	community	and	empower	it	,	actually	left	people	in	the	same	,	if	not	worse	,	position	that	they	were	in	before	.
And	over	the	past	20	years	,	we	've	spent	record	amounts	of	philanthropic	dollars	on	social	problems	,	yet	educational	outcomes	,	malnutrition	,	incarceration	,	obesity	,	diabetes	,	income	disparity	,	they	've	all	gone	up	with	some	exceptions	--	in	particular	,	infant	mortality	among	people	in	poverty	--	but	it	's	a	great	world	that	we	're	bringing	them	into	as	well	.
And	I	know	a	little	bit	about	these	issues	,	because	,	for	many	years	,	I	spent	a	long	time	in	the	non-profit	industrial	complex	,
and	I	'm	a	recovering	executive	director	,	two	years	clean	.
But	during	that	time	,	I	realized	that	it	was	about	projects	and	developing	them	on	the	local	level	that	really	was	going	to	do	the	right	thing	for	our	communities	.
But	I	really	did	struggle	for	financial	support	.
The	greater	our	success	,	the	less	money	came	in	from	foundations	.
And	I	tell	you	,	being	on	the	TED	stage	and	winning	a	MacArthur	in	the	same	exact	year	gave	everyone	the	impression	that	I	had	arrived	.
And	by	the	time	I	'd	moved	on	,	I	was	actually	covering	a	third	of	my	agency	's	budget	deficit	with	speaking	fees	.
And	I	think	because	early	on	,	frankly	,	my	programs	were	just	a	little	bit	ahead	of	their	time	.
But	since	then	,	the	park	that	was	just	a	dump	and	was	featured	at	a	TED2006	Talk	became	this	little	thing	.
But	I	did	in	fact	get	married	in	it	.
Over	here	.
There	goes	my	dog	who	led	me	to	the	park	in	my	wedding	.
The	South	Bronx	Greenway	was	also	just	a	drawing	on	the	stage	back	in	2006	.
Since	then	,	we	got	about	50	million	dollars	in	stimulus	package	money	to	come	and	get	here	.
And	we	love	this	,	because	I	love	construction	now	,	because	we	're	watching	these	things	actually	happen	.
So	I	want	everyone	to	understand	the	critical	importance	of	shifting	charity	into	enterprise	.
I	started	my	firm	to	help	communities	across	the	country	realize	their	own	potential	to	improve	everything	about	the	quality	of	life	for	their	people	.
Hometown	security	is	next	on	my	to-do	list	.
What	we	need	are	people	who	see	the	value	in	investing	in	these	types	of	local	enterprises	,	who	will	partner	with	folks	like	me	to	identify	the	growth	trends	and	climate	adaptation	as	well	as	understand	the	growing	social	costs	of	business	as	usual	.
We	need	to	work	together	to	embrace	and	repair	our	land	,	repair	our	power	systems	and	repair	ourselves	.
It	's	time	to	stop	building	the	shopping	malls	,	the	prisons	,	the	stadiums	and	other	tributes	to	all	of	our	collective	failures	.
It	is	time	that	we	start	building	living	monuments	to	hope	and	possibility	.
Thank	you	very	much	.
I	,	like	many	of	you	,	am	one	of	the	two	billion	people	on	Earth	who	live	in	cities	.
And	there	are	days	--	I	do	n't	know	about	the	rest	of	you	guys	--	but	there	are	days	when	I	palpably	feel	how	much	I	rely	on	other	people	for	pretty	much	everything	in	my	life	.
And	some	days	,	that	can	even	be	a	little	scary	.
But	what	I	'm	here	to	talk	to	you	about	today	is	how	that	same	interdependence	is	actually	an	extremely	powerful	social	infrastructure	that	we	can	actually	harness	to	help	heal	some	of	our	deepest	civic	issues	,	if	we	apply	open	source	collaboration	.
A	couple	of	years	ago	,	I	read	an	article	by	New	York	Times	writer	Michael	Pollan	in	which	he	argued	that	growing	even	some	of	our	own	food	is	one	of	the	best	things	that	we	can	do	for	the	environment	.
Now	at	the	time	that	I	was	reading	this	,	it	was	the	middle	of	the	winter	and	I	definitely	did	not	have	room	for	a	lot	of	dirt	in	my	New	York	City	apartment	.
So	I	was	basically	just	willing	to	settle	for	just	reading	the	next	Wired	magazine	and	finding	out	how	the	experts	were	going	to	figure	out	how	to	solve	all	these	problems	for	us	in	the	future	.
But	that	was	actually	exactly	the	point	that	Michael	Pollan	was	making	in	this	article	--	was	it	's	precisely	when	we	hand	over	the	responsibility	for	all	these	things	to	specialists	that	we	cause	the	kind	of	messes	that	we	see	with	the	food	system	.
So	,	I	happen	to	know	a	little	bit	from	my	own	work	about	how	NASA	has	been	using	hydroponics	to	explore	growing	food	in	space	.
And	you	can	actually	get	optimal	nutritional	yield	by	running	a	kind	of	high-quality	liquid	soil	over	plants	'	root	systems	.
Now	to	a	vegetable	plant	,	my	apartment	has	got	to	be	about	as	foreign	as	outer	space	.
But	I	can	offer	some	natural	light	and	year-round	climate	control	.
Fast-forward	two	years	later	:	we	now	have	window	farms	,	which	are	vertical	,	hydroponic	platforms	for	food-growing	indoors	.
And	the	way	it	works	is	that	there	's	a	pump	at	the	bottom	,	which	periodically	sends	some	of	this	liquid	nutrient	solution	up	to	the	top	,	which	then	trickles	down	through	plants	'	root	systems	that	are	suspended	in	clay	pellets	--	so	there	's	no	dirt	involved	.
Now	light	and	temperature	vary	with	each	window	's	microclimate	,	so	a	window	farm	requires	a	farmer	,	and	she	must	decide	what	kind	of	crops	she	is	going	to	put	in	her	window	farm	,	and	whether	she	is	going	to	feed	her	food	organically	.
Back	at	the	time	,	a	window	farm	was	no	more	than	a	technically	complex	idea	that	was	going	to	require	a	lot	of	testing	.
And	I	really	wanted	it	to	be	an	open	project	,	because	hydroponics	is	one	of	the	fastest	growing	areas	of	patenting	in	the	United	States	right	now	and	could	possibly	become	another	area	like	Monsanto	,	where	we	have	a	lot	of	corporate	intellectual	property	in	the	way	of	people	's	food	.
So	I	decided	that	,	instead	of	creating	a	product	,	what	I	was	going	to	do	was	open	this	up	to	a	whole	bunch	of	co-developers	.
The	first	few	systems	that	we	created	,	they	kind	of	worked	.
We	were	actually	able	to	grow	about	a	salad	a	week	in	a	typical	New	York	City	apartment	window	.
And	we	were	able	to	grow	cherry	tomatoes	and	cucumbers	,	all	kinds	of	stuff	.
But	the	first	few	systems	were	these	leaky	,	loud	power-guzzlers	that	Martha	Stewart	would	definitely	never	have	approved	.
So	to	bring	on	more	co-developers	,	what	we	did	was	we	created	a	social	media	site	on	which	we	published	the	designs	,	we	explained	how	they	worked	,	and	we	even	went	so	far	as	to	point	out	everything	that	was	wrong	with	these	systems	.
And	then	we	invited	people	all	over	the	world	to	build	them	and	experiment	with	us	.
So	actually	now	on	this	website	,	we	have	18,000	people	.
And	we	have	window	farms	all	over	the	world	.
What	we	're	doing	is	what	NASA	or	a	large	corporation	would	call	R	&	amp	;	D	,	or	research	and	development	.
But	what	we	call	it	is	R	&	amp	;	D-I-Y	,	or	research	and	develop	it	yourself	.
So	for	example	,	Jackson	came	along	and	suggested	that	we	use	air	pumps	instead	of	water	pumps	.
It	took	building	a	whole	bunch	of	systems	to	get	it	right	,	but	once	we	did	,	we	were	able	to	cut	our	carbon	footprint	nearly	in	half	.
Tony	in	Chicago	has	been	taking	on	growing	experiments	,	like	lots	of	other	window	farmers	,	and	he	's	been	able	to	get	his	strawberries	to	fruit	for	nine	months	of	the	year	in	low-light	conditions	by	simply	changing	out	the	organic	nutrients	.
And	window	farmers	in	Finland	have	been	customizing	their	window	farms	for	the	dark	days	of	the	Finnish	winters	by	outfitting	them	with	LED	grow	lights	that	they	're	now	making	open	source	and	part	of	the	project	.
So	window	farms	have	been	evolving	through	a	rapid	versioning	process	similar	to	software	.
And	with	every	open	source	project	,	the	real	benefit	is	the	interplay	between	the	specific	concerns	of	people	customizing	their	systems	for	their	own	particular	concerns	and	the	universal	concerns	.
So	my	core	team	and	I	are	able	to	concentrate	on	the	improvements	that	really	benefit	everyone	.
And	we	're	able	to	look	out	for	the	needs	of	newcomers	.
So	for	do-it-yourselfers	,	we	provide	free	,	very	well-tested	instructions	so	that	anyone	,	anywhere	around	the	world	,	can	build	one	of	these	systems	for	free	.
And	there	's	a	patent	pending	on	these	systems	as	well	that	's	held	by	the	community	.
And	to	fund	the	project	,	we	partner	to	create	products	that	we	then	sell	to	schools	and	to	individuals	who	do	n't	have	time	to	build	their	own	systems	.
Now	within	our	community	,	a	certain	culture	has	appeared	.
In	our	culture	,	it	is	better	to	be	a	tester	who	supports	someone	else	's	idea	than	it	is	to	be	just	the	idea	guy	.
What	we	get	out	of	this	project	is	we	get	support	for	our	own	work	,	as	well	as	an	experience	of	actually	contributing	to	the	environmental	movement	in	a	way	other	than	just	screwing	in	new	light	bulbs	.
But	I	think	that	Eileen	expresses	best	what	we	really	get	out	of	this	,	which	is	the	actual	joy	of	collaboration	.
So	she	expresses	here	what	it	's	like	to	see	someone	halfway	across	the	world	having	taken	your	idea	,	built	upon	it	and	then	acknowledging	you	for	contributing	.
If	we	really	want	to	see	the	kind	of	wide	consumer	behavior	change	that	we	're	all	talking	about	as	environmentalists	and	food	people	,	maybe	we	just	need	to	ditch	the	term	``	consumer	''	and	get	behind	the	people	who	are	doing	stuff	.
Open	source	projects	tend	to	have	a	momentum	of	their	own	.
And	what	we	're	seeing	is	that	R	&	amp	;	D-I-Y	has	moved	beyond	just	window	farms	and	LEDs	into	solar	panels	and	aquaponic	systems	.
And	we	're	building	upon	innovations	of	generations	who	went	before	us	.
And	we	're	looking	ahead	at	generations	who	really	need	us	to	retool	our	lives	now	.
So	we	ask	that	you	join	us	in	rediscovering	the	value	of	citizens	united	,	and	to	declare	that	we	are	all	still	pioneers	.
Most	people	do	n't	know	that	when	I	went	to	high	school	in	this	country	--	I	applied	for	university	at	a	time	when	I	was	convinced	I	was	going	to	be	an	artist	and	be	a	sculptor	.
And	I	came	from	a	very	privileged	background	.	I	was	very	lucky	.
My	family	was	wealthy	,	and	my	father	believed	in	one	thing	,	and	that	was	to	give	us	all	as	much	education	as	we	wanted	.
And	I	announced	I	wanted	to	be	a	sculptor	in	Paris	.
And	he	was	a	clever	man	.	He	sort	of	said	,	``	Well	,	that	's	OK	,	but	you	've	done	very	well	in	your	math	SATs	.	''	In	fact	,	I	'd	got	an	800	.	And	he	thought	I	did	very	well	--	and	I	did	,	too	--	in	the	arts	:
this	was	my	passion	.
And	he	said	``	If	you	go	to	MIT	,	''	to	which	I	had	been	given	early	admission	,	``	I	will	pay	for	every	year	you	're	at	MIT	,	in	graduate	or	undergraduate	--	as	much	as	you	want	--	I	will	pay	for	an	equal	number	of	years	for	you	to	live	in	Paris	.	''	And	I	thought	that	was	the	best	deal	in	town	,	so	I	accepted	it	immediately	.
And	I	decided	that	if	I	was	good	in	art	,	and	I	was	good	in	mathematics	,	I	'd	study	architecture	,	which	was	the	blending	of	the	two	.
I	went	and	told	my	headmaster	that	,	at	prep	school	.
And	I	said	to	him	what	I	was	doing	,	that	I	was	going	to	go	study	architecture	because	it	was	art	and	mathematics	put	together	.
He	said	to	me	something	that	just	went	completely	over	my	head	.
He	said	,	``	You	know	,	I	like	grey	suits	,	and	I	like	pin-striped	suits	,	but	I	do	n't	like	grey	pin-striped	suits	.	''	And	I	thought	,	``	What	a	turkey	this	guy	is	,	''	and	I	went	off	to	MIT	.
I	studied	architecture	,	then	did	a	second	degree	in	architecture	,	and	then	actually	quickly	realized	that	it	was	n't	architecture	.
That	really	,	the	mixing	of	art	and	science	was	computers	,
and	that	that	really	was	the	place	to	bring	both	,	and	enjoyed	a	career	doing	that	.
And	probably	,	if	I	were	to	fill	out	Jim	Citrin	's	scale	,	I	'd	put	100	percent	on	the	side	of	the	equation	where	you	spend	time	making	it	possible	for	others	to	be	creative	.
And	after	doing	this	for	a	long	time	,	and	the	Media	Lab	passing	the	baton	on	,	I	thought	,	``	Well	,	maybe	it	's	time	for	me	to	do	a	project	.	Something	that	would	be	important	,	but	also	something	that	would	take	advantage	of	all	of	these	privileges	that	one	had	.	''	And	in	the	case	of	the	Media	Lab	,	knowing	a	lot	of	people	,
knowing	people	who	were	either	executives	or	wealthy	,	and	also	not	having	,	in	my	own	case	,	a	career	to	worry	about	anymore	.
My	career	,	I	mean	,	I	'd	done	my	career	.
Did	n't	have	to	worry	about	earning	money	.	Did	n't	have	to	worry	about	what	people	thought	about	me	.
And	I	said	,	``	Boy	,	let	's	really	do	something	that	takes	advantage	of	all	these	features	,	''	and	thought	that	if	we	could	address	education	,	by	leveraging	the	children	,	and	bringing	to	the	world	the	access	of	the	computers	,	that	that	was	really	the	thing	we	should	do	.
Never	shown	this	picture	before	,	and	probably	going	to	be	sued	for	it	.	It	's	taken	at	three	o'clock	in	the	morning	,	without	the	permission	of	the	company	.
It	's	about	two	weeks	old	.	There	they	are	,	folks	.
If	you	look	at	the	picture	,	you	'll	see	they	're	stacked	up	.
Those	are	conveyor	belts	that	go	around	.
This	is	one	of	the	conveyor	belts	with	the	thing	going	by	,	but	then	you	'll	see	the	ones	up	above	.
What	happens	is	,	they	burn	into	flash	memory	the	software	,	and	then	test	them	for	a	few	hours	.
But	you	've	got	to	have	the	thing	moving	on	the	assembly	line	,	because	it	's	constant	.
So	they	go	around	in	this	loop	,	which	is	why	you	see	them	up	there	.
So	this	was	great	for	us	because	it	was	a	real	turning	point	.	But	it	goes	back	.
This	picture	was	taken	in	1982	,	just	before	the	IBM	PC	was	even	announced	.
Seymour	Papert	and	I	were	bringing	computers	to	schools
and	developing	nations	at	a	time	when	it	was	way	ahead	of	itself	.
But	one	thing	we	learned	was	that	these	kids	can	absolutely	jump	into	it	just	the	same	way	as	our	kids	do	here	.
And	when	people	tell	me	,	``	Who	's	going	to	teach	the	teachers	to	teach	the	kids	?	''	I	say	to	myself	,	``	What	planet	do	you	come	from	?	''	Okay	,	there	's	not	a	person	in	this	room	--	I	do	n't	care	how	techie	you	are	--	there	's	not	a	person	in	this	room	that	does	n't	give	their	laptop	or	cell	phone	to	a	kid	to	help	them	debug	it	.	OK	?
We	all	need	help	,	even	those	of	us	who	are	very	seasoned	.
This	picture	of	Seymour	--	25	years	ago	.	Seymour	made	a	very	simple	observation	in	1968	,	and	then	basically	presented	it	in	1970	--	April	11	to	be	precise	--	called	``	Teaching	Children	Thinking	.	''	What	he	observed	was	that	kids	who	write	computer	programs	understand	things	differently	,	and	when	they	debug	the	programs	,	they	come	the	closest	to	learning	about	learning	.
That	was	very	important	,	and	in	some	sense	,	we	've	lost	that	.
Kids	do	n't	program	enough	and	boy	,	if	there	's	anything	I	hope	this	brings	back	,	it	's	programming	to	kids	.
It	's	really	important	.	Using	applications	is	OK	,	but	programming	is	absolutely	fundamental	.
This	is	being	launched	with	three	languages	in	it	:	Squeak	,	Logo	,	and	a	third	,	that	I	've	never	even	seen	before	.
The	point	being	,	this	is	going	to	be	very	,	very	intensive	on	the	programming	side	.
This	photograph	is	very	important	because	it	's	much	later	.
This	is	in	the	early	2000s	.	My	son	,	Dimitri	--	who	's	here	,	many	of	you	know	Dimitri	--	went	to	Cambodia	,	set	up	this	school	that	we	had	built	,	just	as	the	school	connected	it	to	the	Internet	.
And	these	kids	had	their	laptops	.	But	it	was	really	what	spirited	this	,	plus	the	influence	of	Joe	and	others	.	We	started	One	Laptop	per	Child	.
This	is	the	same	village	in	Cambodia	,	just	a	couple	of	months	ago	.
These	kids	are	real	pros	.	There	were	just	7,000	machines	out	there	being	tested	by	kids	.	Being	a	nonprofit	is	absolutely	fundamental	.
Everybody	advised	me	not	to	be	a	nonprofit	,	but	they	were	all	wrong	.
And	the	reason	being	a	nonprofit	is	important	is	actually	twofold	.
There	are	many	reasons	,	but	the	two	that	merit	the	little	bit	of	time	is	:	one	,	the	clarity	of	purpose	is	there	.	The	moral	purpose	is	clear	.
I	can	see	any	head	of	state	,	any	executive	I	want	,	at	any	time	,	because	I	'm	not	selling	laptops	.	OK	?	I	have	no	shareholders	.
Whether	we	sell	,	it	does	n't	make	any	difference	whatsoever	.	The	clarity	of	purpose	is	absolutely	critical	.	And	the	second	is	very	counterintuitive	--	you	can	get	the	best	people	in	the	world	.
If	you	look	at	our	professional	services	,	including	search	firms	,	including	communications	,	including	legal	services	,	including	banking	,	they	're	all	pro	bono	.	And	it	's	not	to	save	money	.
We	've	got	money	in	the	bank	.	It	's	because	you	get	the	best	people	.
You	get	the	people	who	are	doing	it	because	they	believe	in	the	mission	,	and	they	're	the	best	people	.
We	could	n't	afford	to	hire	a	CFO	.	We	put	out	a	job	description	for	a	CFO	at	zero	salary	,	and	we	had	a	queue	of	people	.
It	allows	you	to	team	up	with	people	.	The	U.N.	's	not	going	to	be	our	partner	if	we	're	profit	making	.	So	announcing	this	with	Kofi	Annan	was	very	important	,	and	the	U.N.	allowed	us	to	basically	reach	all	the	countries	.	And	this	was	the	machine	we	were	showing	before	I	met	Yves	Behar	.
And	while	this	machine	in	some	sense	is	silly	,	in	retrospect	,	it	actually	served	a	very	important	purpose	.
That	pencil-yellow	crank	was	remembered	by	everybody	.
Everybody	remembered	the	pencil-yellow	crank	.	It	's	different	.
It	was	getting	its	power	in	a	different	way	.	It	's	kind	of	childlike	.
Even	though	this	was	n't	the	direction	we	went	because	the	crank	--	it	really	is	stupid	to	have	it	on	board	,	by	the	way	.
In	spite	of	what	some	people	in	the	press	do	n't	get	it	,	did	n't	understand	it	,	we	did	n't	take	it	off	because	we	did	n't	want	to	do	--	having	it	on	the	laptop	itself	is	really	not	what	you	want	.
You	want	a	separate	thing	,	like	the	AC	adaptor	.
I	did	n't	bring	one	with	me	,	but	they	really	work	much	better	off-board	.
And	then	,	I	could	tell	you	lots	about	the	laptop	,	but	I	decided	on	just	four	things	.
Just	keep	in	mind	--	because	there	are	other	people	,	including	Bill	Gates	,	who	said	,	``	Gee	,	you	've	got	a	real	computer	.	''	That	computer	is	unlike	anything	you	've	had	,	and	does	things	--	there	are	four	of	them	--	that	you	do	n't	come	close	to	.	And	it	's	very	important	to	be	low	power	,	and	I	hope	that	's	picked	up	more	by	the	industry	.
That	the	reason	that	you	want	to	be	below	two	watts	is	that	's	roughly	what	you	can	generate	with	your	upper	body	.
Dual-mode	display	--	that	sunlight	display	's	fantastic	.
We	were	using	it	at	lunch	today	in	the	sunlight	,	and	the	more	sunlight	the	better	.
And	that	was	really	critical	.	The	mesh	network	,	it	'll	become	commonplace	.
And	of	course	,	``	rugged	''	goes	without	saying	.
And	the	reason	I	think	design	matters	is	n't	because	I	wanted	to	go	to	art	school	.
And	by	the	way	,	when	I	graduated	from	MIT	,	I	thought	the	worst	and	silliest	thing	to	do	would	be	to	go	to	Paris	for	six	years	.
So	,	I	did	n't	do	that	.	But	design	matters	for	a	number	of	reasons	.
The	most	important	being	that	it	is	the	best	way	to	make	an	inexpensive	product	.
Most	people	make	inexpensive	products	by	taking	cheap	design	,	cheap	labor	,	cheap	components	,	and	making	a	cheap	laptop	.
And	,	in	English	,	the	word	``	cheap	''	has	a	double	meaning	,	which	is	really	appropriate	,
because	it	's	cheap	,	in	the	pejorative	sense	,	as	well	as	inexpensive	.
But	if	you	take	a	different	approach	,	and	you	think	of	very	large-scale	integration	,	very	advanced	materials	,	very	advanced	manufacturing	--	so	you	're	pouring	chemicals	in	one	end	,	iPods	are	spewing	out	the	other	--	and	really	cool	design	,	that	's	what	we	wanted	to	do	.
And	I	can	race	through	these	and	save	a	lot	of	time	because	Yves	and	I	obviously	did	n't	compare	notes	.
These	are	his	slides	,	and	so	I	do	n't	have	to	talk	about	them	.
But	it	was	really	,	to	us	,	very	important	as	a	strategy	.
It	was	n't	just	to	kind	of	make	it	cute	,	because	somebody	--	you	know	,	good	design	is	very	important	.
Yves	showed	one	of	the	power-generating	devices	.
The	mesh	network	,	the	reason	I	--	and	I	wo	n't	go	into	it	in	great	detail	--	but	when	we	deliver	laptops	to	kids	in	the	remotest	and	poorest	parts	of	the	world	,	they	're	connected	.	There	's	not	just	laptops	.
And	so	,	we	have	to	drop	in	satellite	dishes	.	We	put	in	generators	.
It	's	a	lot	of	stuff	that	goes	behind	these	.	These	can	talk	to	each	other	.
If	you	're	in	a	desert	,	they	can	talk	to	each	other	about	two	kilometers	apart	.
If	you	're	in	the	jungle	,	it	's	about	500	meters	.	So	if	a	kid	bicycles	home	,	or	walks	a	few	miles	,	they	're	going	to	be	off	the	grid	,	so	to	speak	.
They	're	not	going	to	be	near	another	laptop	,	so	you	have	to	nail	these	onto	a	tree	,	and	sort	of	,	get	it	.
You	do	n't	call	Verizon	or	Sprint	.	You	build	your	own	network	.
And	that	's	very	important	,	the	user	interface	.
We	are	launching	with	18	keyboards	.	English	is	by	far	the	minority	.
Latin	is	relatively	rare	,	too	.	You	just	look	at	some	of	the	languages	.
I	'm	willing	to	suspect	some	of	you	had	n't	even	heard	of	them	before	.
Is	there	anybody	in	the	room	,	one	person	,	unless	you	work	with	OLPC	,	is	there	anybody	in	the	room	that	can	tell	me	what	language	the	keyboard	is	that	's	on	the	screen	?	There	's	only	one	hand	--	so	you	get	it	.
Yes	,	you	're	right	.	He	's	right	.	It	's	Amharic	,	it	's	Ethiopian	.	In	Ethiopia	,	there	's	never	been	a	keyboard	.
There	is	no	keyboard	standard	because	there	's	no	market	.
And	this	is	the	big	difference	.
Again	,	when	you	're	a	nonprofit	,	you	look	at	children	as	a	mission	,	not	as	a	market	.
So	we	went	to	Ethiopia	,	and	we	helped	them	make	a	keyboard	.
And	this	will	become	the	standard	Ethiopian	keyboard	.
So	what	I	want	to	end	with	is	sort	of	what	we	're	doing	to	roll	it	out	.
And	we	changed	strategy	completely	.	I	decided	at	the	beginning	--	it	was	a	pretty	good	thing	to	decide	in	the	beginning	,	it	's	not	what	we	're	doing	now	--	is	to	go	to	six	countries	.
Big	countries	,	one	of	them	is	not	so	big	,	but	it	's	rich	.
Here	's	the	six	.	We	went	to	the	six	,	and	in	each	case	the	head	of	state	said	he	would	do	it	,	he	'd	do	a	million	.
In	the	case	of	Qaddafi	,	he	'd	do	1.2	million	,	and	that	they	would	launch	it	.
We	thought	,	this	is	exactly	the	right	strategy	,	get	it	out	,	and	then	the	little	countries	could	sort	of	piggyback	on	these	big	countries	.
And	so	I	went	to	each	of	those	countries	at	least	six	times	,	met	with	the	head	of	state	probably	two	or	three	times	.
In	each	case	,	got	the	ministers	,	went	through	a	lot	of	the	stuff	.
This	was	a	period	in	my	life	where	I	was	traveling	330	days	per	year	.
Not	something	you	'd	envy	or	want	to	do	.
In	the	case	of	Libya	,	it	was	a	lot	of	fun	meeting	Qaddafi	in	his	tent	.
The	camel	smells	were	unbelievable	.
And	it	was	45	degrees	C.	I	mean	,	this	was	not	what	you	'd	call	a	cool	experience	.	And	former	countries	--	I	say	former	,	because	none	of	them	really	came	through	this	summer	--
there	was	a	big	difference	between	getting	a	head	of	state	to	have	a	photo	opportunity	,	make	a	press	release	.	So	we	went	to	smaller	ones	.	Uruguay	,	bless	their	hearts	.
Small	country	,	not	so	rich	.	President	said	he	'd	do	it	,	and	guess	what	?
He	did	do	it	.	The	tender	had	nothing	in	it	that	related	to	us	,	nothing	specific	about	sunlight-readable	,	mesh-network	,	low-power	,	but	just	a	vanilla	laptop	proposal	.
And	guess	what	?	We	won	it	hands	down	.
When	it	was	announced	that	they	were	going	to	do	every	child	in	Uruguay	,	the	first	100,000	,	boom	,	went	to	OLPC	.
The	next	day	--	the	next	day	,	not	even	24	hours	had	passed	--	in	Peru	,	the	president	of	Peru	said	,	``	We	'll	do	250	.	''	And	boom	,	a	little	domino	effect	.
The	president	of	Rwanda	stepped	in	and	said	he	would	do	it	.
The	president	of	Ethiopia	said	he	would	do	it	.
And	boom	,	boom	,	boom	.	The	president	of	Mongolia	.
And	so	what	happens	is	,	these	things	start	to	happen	with	these	countries	--
still	not	enough	.
Add	up	all	those	countries	,	it	did	n't	quite	get	to	thing	,	so	we	said	,	``	Let	's	start	a	program	in	the	United	States	.	''	So	,	end	of	August	,	early	September	,	we	decide	to	do	this	.	We	announced	it	near	the	middle	,	end	--
just	when	the	Clinton	Initiative	was	taking	place	.
We	thought	that	was	a	good	time	to	announce	it	.
Launched	it	on	the	12	of	November	.
We	said	it	would	be	just	for	a	short	period	until	the	26	.	We	've	extended	it	until	the	31	.
And	the	``	Give	One	,	Get	One	''	program	is	really	important	because	it	got	a	lot	of	people	absolutely	interested	.
The	first	day	it	was	just	wild	.	And	then	we	said	,	``	Well	,	let	's	get	people	to	give	many	.	Not	just	one	,	and	get	one	,	but	maybe	give	100	,	give	1,000	.	''	And	that	's	where	you	come	in	.
And	that	's	where	I	think	it	's	very	important	.	I	do	n't	want	you	all	to	go	out	and	buy	400	dollars	worth	of	laptops	.	Okay	?	Do	it	,	but	that	's	not	going	to	help	.	Okay	?
If	everybody	in	this	room	goes	out	tonight	and	orders	one	of	these	things	for	400	dollars	,	whatever	it	is	,	300	people	in	the	room	doing	it	--	yeah	,	great	.
I	want	you	do	something	else	.
And	it	's	not	to	go	out	and	buy	100	or	1,000	,	though	,	I	invite	you	to	do	that	,	and	10,000	would	be	even	better	.
Tell	people	about	it	!	It	's	got	to	become	viral	,	OK	?
Use	your	mailing	lists	.	People	in	this	room	have	extraordinary	mailing	lists	.
Get	your	friends	to	give	one	,	get	one	.
And	if	each	one	of	you	sends	it	to	300	or	400	people	,	that	would	be	fantastic	.
I	wo	n't	dwell	on	the	pricing	at	all	.
Just	to	say	that	when	you	do	the	``	Give	One	,	Get	One	,	''	a	lot	of	press	is	a	bit	about	,	``	They	did	n't	make	it	,	it	's	188	dollars	,	it	's	not	100	.	''	It	will	be	100	in	two	years	.	It	will	go	below	100	.
We	've	pledged	not	to	add	features	,	but	to	bring	that	price	down	.
But	it	was	the	countries	that	wanted	it	to	go	up	,	and	we	let	them	push	it	up	for	all	sorts	of	reasons	.	So	what	you	can	do	--	I	've	just	said	it	.	Do	n't	just	give	one	,	get	one	.
I	just	want	to	end	with	one	last	one	.	This	one	is	not	even	The	first	kids	got	their	laptops	.	They	got	them	by	ship	,	and	I	'm	talking	now	about	7,000	,	8,000	at	a	time	went	out	this	week	.
They	went	to	Uruguay	,	Peru	,	Mexico	.
And	it	's	been	slow	coming	,	and	we	're	only	making	about	5,000	a	week	,	but	we	hope	,	we	hope	,	sometime	in	next	year	,	maybe	by	the	middle	of	the	year	,	to	hit	a	million	a	month	.	Now	put	that	number	,	and	a	million	is	n't	so	much	.	It	's	not	a	big	number	.
We	're	selling	a	billion	cell	phones	worldwide	this	year	.
But	a	million	a	month	in	laptop-land	is	a	big	number	.
And	the	world	production	today	,	everybody	combined	,	making	laptops	,	is	five	million	a	month	.	So	I	'm	standing	here	telling	you	that	sometime	next	year	,	we	're	going	to	make	20	percent	of	the	world	production	.
And	if	we	do	that	,	there	are	going	to	be	a	lot	of	lucky	kids	out	there	.
And	we	hope	if	you	have	EG	two	years	from	now	,	or	whenever	you	have	it	again	,	I	wo	n't	have	bad	breath	,	and	I	will	be	invited	back	,	and	will	have	,	hopefully	by	then	,	maybe	100	million	out	there	to	children	.
Thank	you	.
What	I	want	to	tell	you	about	today	is	how	I	see	robots	invading	our	lives	at	multiple	levels	,	over	multiple	timescales	.
And	when	I	look	out	in	the	future	,	I	ca	n't	imagine	a	world	,	500	years	from	now	,	where	we	do	n't	have	robots	everywhere	.	Assuming	--	despite	all	the	dire	predictions	from	many	people	about	our	future	--	assuming	we	're	still	around	,	I	ca	n't	imagine	the	world	not	being	populated	with	robots	.
And	then	the	question	is	,	well	,	if	they	're	going	to	be	here	in	500	years	,	are	they	going	to	be	everywhere	sooner	than	that	?
Are	they	going	to	be	around	in	50	years	?
Yeah	,	I	think	that	's	pretty	likely	--	there	's	going	to	be	lots	of	robots	everywhere	.
And	in	fact	I	think	that	's	going	to	be	a	lot	sooner	than	that	.
I	think	we	're	sort	of	on	the	cusp	of	robots	becoming	common	,	and	I	think	we	're	sort	of	around	1978	or	1980	in	personal	computer	years	,	where	the	first	few	robots	are	starting	to	appear	.
Computers	sort	of	came	around	through	games	and	toys	.
And	you	know	,	the	first	computer	most	people	had	in	the	house	may	have	been	a	computer	to	play	Pong	,	a	little	microprocessor	embedded	,	and	then	other	games	that	came	after	that	.
And	we	're	starting	to	see	that	same	sort	of	thing	with	robots	:	LEGO	Mindstorms	,	Furbies	--	who	here	--	did	anyone	here	have	a	Furby	?
Yeah	,	there	's	38	million	of	them	sold	worldwide	.
They	are	pretty	common	.	And	they	're	a	little	tiny	robot	,	a	simple	robot	with	some	sensors	,
a	little	bit	of	processing	actuation	.
On	the	right	there	is	another	robot	doll	,	who	you	could	get	a	couple	of	years	ago	.
And	just	as	in	the	early	days	,	when	there	was	a	lot	of	sort	of	amateur	interaction	over	computers	,	you	can	now	get	various	hacking	kits	,	how-to-hack	books	.
And	on	the	left	there	is	a	platform	from	Evolution	Robotics	,	where	you	put	a	PC	on	,	and	you	program	this	thing	with	a	GUI	to	wander	around	your	house	and	do	various	stuff	.
And	then	there	's	a	higher	price	point	sort	of	robot	toys	--	the	Sony	Aibo	.	And	on	the	right	there	,	is	one	that	the	NEC	developed	,	the	PaPeRo	,	which	I	do	n't	think	they	're	going	to	release	.
But	nevertheless	,	those	sorts	of	things	are	out	there	.
And	we	've	seen	,	over	the	last	two	or	three	years	,	lawn-mowing	robots	,	Husqvarna	on	the	bottom	,	Friendly	Robotics	on	top	there	,	an	Israeli	company	.
And	then	in	the	last	12	months	or	so	we	've	started	to	see	a	bunch	of	home-cleaning	robots	appear	.
The	top	left	one	is	a	very	nice	home-cleaning	robot	from	a	company	called	Dyson	,	in	the	U.K	.	Except	it	was	so	expensive	--	3,500	dollars	--	they	did	n't	release	it	.
But	at	the	bottom	left	,	you	see	Electrolux	,	which	is	on	sale	.
Another	one	from	Karcher	.
At	the	bottom	right	is	one	that	I	built	in	my	lab	about	10	years	ago	,	and	we	finally	turned	that	into	a	product	.
And	let	me	just	show	you	that	.
We	're	going	to	give	this	away	I	think	,	Chris	said	,	after	the	talk	.
This	is	a	robot	that	you	can	go	out	and	buy	,	and	that	will	clean	up	your	floor	.
And	it	starts	off	sort	of	just	going	around	in	ever-increasing	circles	.
If	it	hits	something	--	you	people	see	that	?
Now	it	's	doing	wall-following	,	it	's	following	around	my	feet	to	clean	up	around	me	.	Let	's	see	,	let	's	--	oh	,	who	stole	my	Rice	Krispies	?	They	stole	my	Rice	Krispies	!	Do	n't	worry	,	relax	,	no	,	relax	,	it	's	a	robot	,	it	's	smart	!
See	,	the	three-year-old	kids	,	they	do	n't	worry	about	it	.
It	's	grown-ups	that	get	really	upset	.
We	'll	just	put	some	crap	here	.
Okay	.
I	do	n't	know	if	you	see	--	so	,	I	put	a	bunch	of	Rice	Krispies	there	,	I	put	some	pennies	,	let	's	just	shoot	it	at	that	,	see	if	it	cleans	up	.
Yeah	,	OK	.	So	--	we	'll	leave	that	for	later	.
Part	of	the	trick	was	building	a	better	cleaning	mechanism	,	actually	;	the	intelligence	on	board	was	fairly	simple	.
And	that	's	true	with	a	lot	of	robots	.
We	've	all	,	I	think	,	become	,	sort	of	computational	chauvinists	,	and	think	that	computation	is	everything	,	but	the	mechanics	still	matter	.
Here	's	another	robot	,	the	PackBot	,	that	we	've	been	building	for	a	bunch	of	years	.
It	's	a	military	surveillance	robot	,	to	go	in	ahead	of	troops	--	looking	at	caves	,	for	instance	.
But	we	had	to	make	it	fairly	robust	,	much	more	robust	than	the	robots	we	build	in	our	labs	.
On	board	that	robot	is	a	PC	running	Linux	.
It	can	withstand	a	400G	shock	.	The	robot	has	local	intelligence	:	it	can	flip	itself	over	,	can	get	itself	into	communication	range	,	can	go	upstairs	by	itself	,	et	cetera	.
Okay	,	so	it	's	doing	local	navigation	there	.
A	soldier	gives	it	a	command	to	go	upstairs	,	and	it	does	.
That	was	not	a	controlled	descent	.
Now	it	's	going	to	head	off	.
And	the	big	breakthrough	for	these	robots	,	really	,	was	September	11th	.
We	had	the	robots	down	at	the	World	Trade	Center	late	that	evening	.
Could	n't	do	a	lot	in	the	main	rubble	pile	,	things	were	just	too	--	there	was	nothing	left	to	do	.
But	we	did	go	into	all	the	surrounding	buildings	that	had	been	evacuated	,	and	searched	for	possible	survivors	in	the	buildings	that	were	too	dangerous	to	go	into	.
Let	's	run	this	video	.
Reporter	:	...	battlefield	companions	are	helping	to	reduce	the	combat	risks	.
Nick	Robertson	has	that	story	.
Rodney	Brooks	:	Can	we	have	another	one	of	these	?
Okay	,	good	.
So	,	this	is	a	corporal	who	had	seen	a	robot	two	weeks	previously	.
He	's	sending	robots	into	caves	,	looking	at	what	's	going	on	.
The	robot	's	being	totally	autonomous	.
The	worst	thing	that	's	happened	in	the	cave	so	far	was	one	of	the	robots	fell	down	ten	meters	.
So	one	year	ago	,	the	US	military	did	n't	have	these	robots	.
Now	they	're	on	active	duty	in	Afghanistan	every	day	.
And	that	's	one	of	the	reasons	they	say	a	robot	invasion	is	happening	.
There	's	a	sea	change	happening	in	how	--	where	technology	's	going	.
Thanks	.
And	over	the	next	couple	of	months	,	we	're	going	to	be	sending	robots	in	production	down	producing	oil	wells	to	get	that	last	few	years	of	oil	out	of	the	ground	.
Very	hostile	environments	,	150˚	C	,	10,000	PSI	.
Autonomous	robots	going	down	,	doing	this	sort	of	work	.
But	robots	like	this	,	they	're	a	little	hard	to	program	.
How	,	in	the	future	,	are	we	going	to	program	our	robots	and	make	them	easier	to	use	?
And	I	want	to	actually	use	a	robot	here	--	a	robot	named	Chris	--	stand	up	.	Yeah	.	Okay	.
Come	over	here	.	Now	notice	,	he	thinks	robots	have	to	be	a	bit	stiff	.
He	sort	of	does	that	.	But	I	'm	going	to	--	Chris	Anderson	:	I	'm	just	British	.	RB	:	Oh	.
I	'm	going	to	show	this	robot	a	task	.	It	's	a	very	complex	task	.
Now	notice	,	he	nodded	there	,	he	was	giving	me	some	indication	he	was	understanding	the	flow	of	communication	.
And	if	I	'd	said	something	completely	bizarre	he	would	have	looked	askance	at	me	,	and	regulated	the	conversation	.
So	now	I	brought	this	up	in	front	of	him	.
I	'd	looked	at	his	eyes	,	and	I	saw	his	eyes	looked	at	this	bottle	top	.
And	I	'm	doing	this	task	here	,	and	he	's	checking	up	.
His	eyes	are	going	back	and	forth	up	to	me	,	to	see	what	I	'm	looking	at	--	so	we	've	got	shared	attention	.
And	so	I	do	this	task	,	and	he	looks	,	and	he	looks	to	me	to	see	what	's	happening	next	.	And	now	I	'll	give	him	the	bottle	,	and	we	'll	see	if	he	can	do	the	task	.	Can	you	do	that	?
Okay	.	He	's	pretty	good	.	Yeah	.	Good	,	good	,	good	.
I	did	n't	show	you	how	to	do	that	.
Now	see	if	you	can	put	it	back	together	.
And	he	thinks	a	robot	has	to	be	really	slow	.
Good	robot	,	that	's	good	.
So	we	saw	a	bunch	of	things	there	.
We	saw	when	we	're	interacting	,	we	're	trying	to	show	someone	how	to	do	something	,	we	direct	their	visual	attention	.
The	other	thing	communicates	their	internal	state	to	us	,	whether	he	's	understanding	or	not	,	regulates	a	social	interaction	.
There	was	shared	attention	looking	at	the	same	sort	of	thing	,	and	recognizing	socially	communicated	reinforcement	at	the	end	.
And	we	've	been	trying	to	put	that	into	our	lab	robots	because	we	think	this	is	how	you	're	going	to	want	to	interact	with	robots	in	the	future	.
I	just	want	to	show	you	one	technical	diagram	here	.
The	most	important	thing	for	building	a	robot	that	you	can	interact	with	socially	is	its	visual	attention	system	.
Because	what	it	pays	attention	to	is	what	it	's	seeing	and	interacting	with	,	and	what	you	're	understanding	what	it	's	doing	.
So	in	the	videos	I	'm	about	to	show	you	,	you	're	going	to	see	a	visual	attention	system	on	a	robot	which	has	--	it	looks	for	skin	tone	in	HSV	space	,	so	it	works	across	all	human	colorings	.
It	looks	for	highly	saturated	colors	,	from	toys	.
And	it	looks	for	things	that	move	around	.
And	it	weights	those	together	into	an	attention	window	,	and	it	looks	for	the	highest-scoring	place	--	the	stuff	where	the	most	interesting	stuff	is	happening	--
and	that	is	what	its	eyes	then	segue	to	.
And	it	looks	right	at	that	.
At	the	same	time	,	some	top-down	sort	of	stuff	:	might	decide	that	it	's	lonely	and	look	for	skin	tone	,	or	might	decide	that	it	's	bored	and	look	for	a	toy	to	play	with	.
And	so	these	weights	change	.
And	over	here	on	the	right	,	this	is	what	we	call	the	Steven	Spielberg	memorial	module	.
Did	people	see	the	movie	``	AI	''	?
RB	:	Yeah	,	it	was	really	bad	,	but	--	remember	,	especially	when	Haley	Joel	Osment	,	the	little	robot	,	looked	at	the	blue	fairy	for	2,000	years	without	taking	his	eyes	off	it	?
Well	,	this	gets	rid	of	that	,	because	this	is	a	habituation	Gaussian	that	gets	negative	,	and	more	and	more	intense	as	it	looks	at	one	thing	.
And	it	gets	bored	,	so	it	will	then	look	away	at	something	else	.
So	,	once	you	've	got	that	--	and	here	's	a	robot	,	here	's	Kismet	,	looking	around	for	a	toy	.	You	can	tell	what	it	's	looking	at	.
You	can	estimate	its	gaze	direction	from	those	eyeballs	covering	its	camera	,	and	you	can	tell	when	it	's	actually	seeing	the	toy	.
And	it	's	got	a	little	bit	of	an	emotional	response	here	.
But	it	's	still	going	to	pay	attention	if	something	more	significant	comes	into	its	field	of	view	--	such	as	Cynthia	Breazeal	,	the	builder	of	this	robot	,	from	the	right	.
It	sees	her	,	pays	attention	to	her	.
Kismet	has	an	underlying	,	three-dimensional	emotional	space	,	a	vector	space	,	of	where	it	is	emotionally	.
And	at	different	places	in	that	space	,	it	expresses	--	can	we	have	the	volume	on	here	?
Can	you	hear	that	now	,	out	there	?
Kismet	:	Do	you	really	think	so	?	Do	you	really	think	so	?
Do	you	really	think	so	?
RB	:	So	it	's	expressing	its	emotion	through	its	face	and	the	prosody	in	its	voice	.
And	when	I	was	dealing	with	my	robot	over	here	,	Chris	,	the	robot	,	was	measuring	the	prosody	in	my	voice	,
and	so	we	have	the	robot	measure	prosody	for	four	basic	messages	that	mothers	give	their	children	pre-linguistically	.
Here	we	've	got	naive	subjects	praising	the	robot	:	Voice	:	Nice	robot	.
You	're	such	a	cute	little	robot	.
RB	:	And	the	robot	's	reacting	appropriately	.
Voice	:	...	very	good	,	Kismet	.
Voice	:	Look	at	my	smile	.
RB	:	It	smiles	.	She	imitates	the	smile	.	This	happens	a	lot	.
These	are	naive	subjects	.
Here	we	asked	them	to	get	the	robot	's	attention	and	indicate	when	they	have	the	robot	's	attention	.
Voice	:	Hey	,	Kismet	,	ah	,	there	it	is	.
RB	:	So	she	realizes	she	has	the	robot	's	attention	.
Voice	:	Kismet	,	do	you	like	the	toy	?	Oh	.
RB	:	Now	,	here	they	're	asked	to	prohibit	the	robot	,	and	this	first	woman	really	pushes	the	robot	into	an	emotional	corner	.
Voice	:	No	.	No	.	You	're	not	to	do	that	.	No	.
Not	appropriate	.	No	.	No	.
RB	:	I	'm	going	to	leave	it	at	that	.
We	put	that	together	.	Then	we	put	in	turn	taking	.
When	we	talk	to	someone	,	we	talk	.
Then	we	sort	of	raise	our	eyebrows	,	move	our	eyes	,	give	the	other	person	the	idea	it	's	their	turn	to	talk	.
And	then	they	talk	,	and	then	we	pass	the	baton	back	and	forth	between	each	other	.
So	we	put	this	in	the	robot	.
We	got	a	bunch	of	naive	subjects	in	,	we	did	n't	tell	them	anything	about	the	robot	,	sat	them	down	in	front	of	the	robot	and	said	,	talk	to	the	robot	.
Now	what	they	did	n't	know	was	,	the	robot	was	n't	understanding	a	word	they	said	,	and	that	the	robot	was	n't	speaking	English	.
It	was	just	saying	random	English	phonemes	.
And	I	want	you	to	watch	carefully	,	at	the	beginning	of	this	,	where	this	person	,	Ritchie	,	who	happened	to	talk	to	the	robot	for	25	minutes	--	--	says	,	``	I	want	to	show	you	something	.
I	want	to	show	you	my	watch	.	''
And	he	brings	the	watch	center	,	into	the	robot	's	field	of	vision	,	points	to	it	,	gives	it	a	motion	cue	,	and	the	robot	looks	at	the	watch	quite	successfully	.
We	do	n't	know	whether	he	understood	or	not	that	the	robot	--	Notice	the	turn-taking	.
Ritchie	:	OK	,	I	want	to	show	you	something	.	OK	,	this	is	a	watch	that	my	girlfriend	gave	me	.
Robot	:	Oh	,	cool	.
Ritchie	:	Yeah	,	look	,	it	's	got	a	little	blue	light	in	it	too	.	I	almost	lost	it	this	week	.
RB	:	So	it	's	making	eye	contact	with	him	,	following	his	eyes	.
Ritchie	:	Can	you	do	the	same	thing	?	Robot	:	Yeah	,	sure	.
RB	:	And	they	successfully	have	that	sort	of	communication	.
And	here	's	another	aspect	of	the	sorts	of	things	that	Chris	and	I	were	doing	.
This	is	another	robot	,	Cog	.
They	first	make	eye	contact	,	and	then	,	when	Christie	looks	over	at	this	toy	,	the	robot	estimates	her	gaze	direction	and	looks	at	the	same	thing	that	she	's	looking	at	.
So	we	're	going	to	see	more	and	more	of	this	sort	of	robot	over	the	next	few	years	in	labs	.
But	then	the	big	questions	,	two	big	questions	that	people	ask	me	are	:	if	we	make	these	robots	more	and	more	human-like	,	will	we	accept	them	,	will	we	--	will	they	need	rights	eventually	?
And	the	other	question	people	ask	me	is	,	will	they	want	to	take	over	?
And	on	the	first	--	you	know	,	this	has	been	a	very	Hollywood	theme	with	lots	of	movies	.	You	probably	recognize	these	characters	here	--	where	in	each	of	these	cases	,	the	robots	want	more	respect	.
Well	,	do	you	ever	need	to	give	robots	respect	?
They	're	just	machines	,	after	all	.
But	I	think	,	you	know	,	we	have	to	accept	that	we	are	just	machines	.
After	all	,	that	's	certainly	what	modern	molecular	biology	says	about	us	.
You	do	n't	see	a	description	of	how	,	you	know	,	Molecule	A	,	you	know	,	comes	up	and	docks	with	this	other	molecule	.
And	it	's	moving	forward	,	you	know	,	propelled	by	various	charges	,	and	then	the	soul	steps	in	and	tweaks	those	molecules	so	that	they	connect	.
It	's	all	mechanistic	.	We	are	mechanism	.
If	we	are	machines	,	then	in	principle	at	least	,	we	should	be	able	to	build	machines	out	of	other	stuff	,	which	are	just	as	alive	as	we	are	.
But	I	think	for	us	to	admit	that	,	we	have	to	give	up	on	our	special-ness	,	in	a	certain	way	.
And	we	've	had	the	retreat	from	special-ness	under	the	barrage	of	science	and	technology	many	times	over	the	last	few	hundred	years	,	at	least	.
500	years	ago	we	had	to	give	up	the	idea	that	we	are	the	center	of	the	universe	when	the	earth	started	to	go	around	the	sun	;	150	years	ago	,	with	Darwin	,	we	had	to	give	up	the	idea	we	were	different	from	animals	.
And	to	imagine	--	you	know	,	it	's	always	hard	for	us	.
Recently	we	've	been	battered	with	the	idea	that	maybe	we	did	n't	even	have	our	own	creation	event	,	here	on	earth	,	which	people	did	n't	like	much	.	And	then	the	human	genome	said	,	maybe	we	only	have	35,000	genes	.	And	that	was	really	--	people	did	n't	like	that	,	we	've	got	more	genes	than	that	.
We	do	n't	like	to	give	up	our	special-ness	,	so	,	you	know	,	having	the	idea	that	robots	could	really	have	emotions	,	or	that	robots	could	be	living	creatures	--	I	think	is	going	to	be	hard	for	us	to	accept	.
But	we	're	going	to	come	to	accept	it	over	the	next	50	years	or	so	.
And	the	second	question	is	,	will	the	machines	want	to	take	over	?
And	here	the	standard	scenario	is	that	we	create	these	things	,	they	grow	,	we	nurture	them	,	they	learn	a	lot	from	us	,	and	then	they	start	to	decide	that	we	're	pretty	boring	,	slow	.
They	want	to	take	over	from	us	.
And	for	those	of	you	that	have	teenagers	,	you	know	what	that	's	like	.
But	Hollywood	extends	it	to	the	robots	.
And	the	question	is	,	you	know	,	will	someone	accidentally	build	a	robot	that	takes	over	from	us	?
And	that	's	sort	of	like	this	lone	guy	in	the	backyard	,	you	know	--	``	I	accidentally	built	a	747	.	''
I	do	n't	think	that	's	going	to	happen	.
And	I	do	n't	think	--	--	I	do	n't	think	we	're	going	to	deliberately	build	robots	that	we	're	uncomfortable	with	.
We	'll	--	you	know	,	they	're	not	going	to	have	a	super	bad	robot	.
Before	that	has	to	come	to	be	a	mildly	bad	robot	,	and	before	that	a	not	so	bad	robot	.
And	we	're	just	not	going	to	let	it	go	that	way	.
So	,	I	think	I	'm	going	to	leave	it	at	that	:	the	robots	are	coming	,	we	do	n't	have	too	much	to	worry	about	,	it	's	going	to	be	a	lot	of	fun	,	and	I	hope	you	all	enjoy	the	journey	over	the	next	50	years	.
When	I	was	little	--	and	by	the	way	,	I	was	little	once	--	my	father	told	me	a	story	about	an	18th	century	watchmaker	.
And	what	this	guy	had	done	:	he	used	to	produce	these	fabulously	beautiful	watches	.
And	one	day	,	one	of	his	customers	came	into	his	workshop	and	asked	him	to	clean	the	watch	that	he	'd	bought	.
And	the	guy	took	it	apart	,	and	one	of	the	things	he	pulled	out	was	one	of	the	balance	wheels	.
And	as	he	did	so	,	his	customer	noticed	that	on	the	back	side	of	the	balance	wheel	was	an	engraving	,
were	words	.
And	he	said	to	the	guy	,	``	Why	have	you	put	stuff	on	the	back	that	no	one	will	ever	see	?	''
And	the	watchmaker	turned	around	and	said	,	``	God	can	see	it	.	''
Now	I	'm	not	in	the	least	bit	religious	,	neither	was	my	father	,	but	at	that	point	,	I	noticed	something	happening	here	.
I	felt	something	in	this	plexus	of	blood	vessels	and	nerves	,	and	there	must	be	some	muscles	in	there	as	well	somewhere	,	I	guess	.
But	I	felt	something	.
And	it	was	a	physiological	response	.
And	from	that	point	on	,	from	my	age	at	the	time	,	I	began	to	think	of	things	in	a	different	way	.
And	as	I	took	on	my	career	as	a	designer	,	I	began	to	ask	myself	the	simple	question	:	Do	we	actually	think	beauty	,	or	do	we	feel	it	?
Now	you	probably	know	the	answer	to	this	already	.
You	probably	think	,	well	,	I	do	n't	know	which	one	you	think	it	is	,	but	I	think	it	's	about	feeling	beauty	.
And	so	I	then	moved	on	into	my	design	career	and	began	to	find	some	exciting	things	.
One	of	the	most	early	work	was	done	in	automotive	design	--	some	very	exciting	work	was	done	there	.
And	during	a	lot	of	this	work	,	we	found	something	,	or	I	found	something	,	that	really	fascinated	me	,	and	maybe	you	can	remember	it	.
Do	you	remember	when	lights	used	to	just	go	on	and	off	,	click	click	,	when	you	closed	the	door	in	a	car	?
And	then	somebody	,	I	think	it	was	BMW	,	introduced	a	light	that	went	out	slowly	.
Remember	that	?
I	remember	it	clearly	.	Do	you	remember	the	first	time	you	were	in	a	car	and	it	did	that	?
I	remember	sitting	there	thinking	,	this	is	fantastic	.
In	fact	,	I	've	never	found	anybody	that	does	n't	like	the	light	that	goes	out	slowly	.
I	thought	,	well	what	the	hell	's	that	about	?
So	I	started	to	ask	myself	questions	about	it	.
And	the	first	was	,	I	'd	ask	other	people	:	``	Do	you	like	it	?	''	``	Yes	.	''
``	Why	?	''	And	they	'd	say	,	``	Oh	,	it	feels	so	natural	,	''
or	,	``	It	's	nice	.	''
I	thought	,	well	that	's	not	good	enough	.
Can	we	cut	down	a	little	bit	further	,	because	,	as	a	designer	,	I	need	the	vocabulary	,	I	need	the	keyboard	,	of	how	this	actually	works	.
And	so	I	did	some	experiments	.
And	I	suddenly	realized	that	there	was	something	that	did	exactly	that	--	light	to	dark	in	six	seconds	--	exactly	that	.
Do	you	know	what	it	is	?	Anyone	?
You	see	,	using	this	bit	,	the	thinky	bit	,	the	slow	bit	of	the	brain	--	using	that	.
And	this	is	n't	a	think	,	it	's	a	feel	.
And	would	you	do	me	a	favor	?
For	the	next	14	minutes	or	whatever	it	is	,	will	you	feel	stuff	?
I	do	n't	need	you	to	think	so	much	as	I	want	you	to	feel	it	.
I	felt	a	sense	of	relaxation	tempered	with	anticipation	.
And	that	thing	that	I	found	was	the	cinema	or	the	theater	.
It	's	actually	just	happened	here	--	light	to	dark	in	six	seconds	.
And	when	that	happens	,	are	you	sitting	there	going	,	``	No	,	the	movie	's	about	to	start	,	''	or	are	you	going	,	``	That	's	fantastic	.	I	'm	looking	forward	to	it	.
I	get	a	sense	of	anticipation	''	?
Now	I	'm	not	a	neuroscientist	.
I	do	n't	know	even	if	there	is	something	called	a	conditioned	reflex	.
But	it	might	be	.
Because	the	people	I	speak	to	in	the	northern	hemisphere	that	used	to	go	in	the	cinema	get	this	.
And	some	of	the	people	I	speak	to	that	have	never	seen	a	movie	or	been	to	the	theater	do	n't	get	it	in	the	same	way	.
Everybody	likes	it	,	but	some	like	it	more	than	others	.
So	this	leads	me	to	think	of	this	in	a	different	way	.
We	're	not	feeling	it	.	We	're	thinking	beauty	is	in	the	limbic	system	--	if	that	's	not	an	outmoded	idea	.
These	are	the	bits	,	the	pleasure	centers	,	and	maybe	what	I	'm	seeing	and	sensing	and	feeling	is	bypassing	my	thinking	.
The	wiring	from	your	sensory	apparatus	to	those	bits	is	shorter	than	the	bits	that	have	to	pass	through	the	thinky	bit	,	the	cortex	.
They	arrive	first	.
So	how	do	we	make	that	actually	work	?
And	how	much	of	that	reactive	side	of	it	is	due	to	what	we	already	know	,	or	what	we	're	going	to	learn	,	about	something	?
This	is	one	of	the	most	beautiful	things	I	know	.
It	's	a	plastic	bag	.
And	when	I	looked	at	it	first	,	I	thought	,	no	,	there	's	no	beauty	in	that	.
Then	I	found	out	,	post	exposure	,	that	this	plastic	bag	if	I	put	it	into	a	filthy	puddle	or	a	stream	filled	with	coliforms	and	all	sorts	of	disgusting	stuff	,	that	that	filthy	water	will	migrate	through	the	wall	of	the	bag	by	osmosis	and	end	up	inside	it	as	pure	,	potable	drinking	water	.
And	all	of	a	sudden	,	this	plastic	bag	was	extremely	beautiful	to	me	.
Now	I	'm	going	to	ask	you	again	to	switch	on	the	emotional	bit	.
Would	you	mind	taking	the	brain	out	,	and	I	just	want	you	to	feel	something	.
Look	at	that	.	What	are	you	feeling	about	it	?
Is	it	beautiful	?	Is	it	exciting	?
I	'm	watching	your	faces	very	carefully	.
There	's	some	rather	bored-looking	gentlemen	and	some	slightly	engaged-looking	ladies	who	are	picking	up	something	off	that	.
Maybe	there	's	an	innocence	to	it	.
Now	I	'm	going	to	tell	you	what	it	is	.	Are	you	ready	?
This	is	the	last	act	on	this	Earth	of	a	little	girl	called	Heidi	,	five	years	old	,	before	she	died	of	cancer	to	the	spine	.
It	's	the	last	thing	she	did	,	the	last	physical	act	.
Look	at	that	picture	.
Look	at	the	innocence	.	Look	at	the	beauty	in	it	.
Is	it	beautiful	now	?
Stop	.	Stop	.	How	do	you	feel	?
Where	are	you	feeling	this	?
I	'm	feeling	it	here	.	I	feel	it	here	.
And	I	'm	watching	your	faces	,	because	your	faces	are	telling	me	something	.
The	lady	over	there	is	actually	crying	,	by	the	way	.
But	what	are	you	doing	?
I	watch	what	people	do	.
I	watch	faces	.
I	watch	reactions	.
Because	I	have	to	know	how	people	react	to	things	.
And	one	of	the	most	common	faces	on	something	faced	with	beauty	,	something	stupefyingly	delicious	,	is	what	I	call	the	OMG	.
And	by	the	way	,	there	's	no	pleasure	in	that	face	.
It	's	not	a	``	this	is	wonderful	!	''
The	eyebrows	are	doing	this	,	the	eyes	are	defocused	,	and	the	mouth	is	hanging	open	.
That	's	not	the	expression	of	joy	.
There	's	something	else	in	that	.
There	's	something	weird	happening	.
So	pleasure	seems	to	be	tempered	by	a	whole	series	of	different	things	coming	in	.
Poignancy	is	a	word	I	love	as	a	designer	.
It	means	something	triggering	a	big	emotional	response	,	often	quite	a	sad	emotional	response	,	but	it	's	part	of	what	we	do	.
It	is	n't	just	about	nice	.
And	this	is	the	dilemma	,	this	is	the	paradox	,	of	beauty	.
Sensorily	,	we	're	taking	in	all	sorts	of	things	--	mixtures	of	things	that	are	good	,	bad	,	exciting	,	frightening	--	to	come	up	with	that	sensorial	exposure	,	that	sensation	of	what	's	going	on	.
Pathos	appears	obviously	as	part	of	what	you	just	saw	in	that	little	girl	's	drawing	.
And	also	triumph	,	this	sense	of	transcendence	,	this	``	I	never	knew	that	.	Ah	,	this	is	something	new	.	''
And	that	's	packed	in	there	as	well	.
And	as	we	assemble	these	tools	,	from	a	design	point	of	view	,	I	get	terribly	excited	about	it	,	because	these	are	things	,	as	we	've	already	said	,	they	're	arriving	at	the	brain	,	it	would	seem	,	before	cognition	,	before	we	can	manipulate	them	--	electrochemical	party	tricks	.
Now	what	I	'm	also	interested	in	is	:	Is	it	possible	to	separate	intrinsic	and	extrinsic	beauty	?
By	that	,	I	mean	intrinsically	beautiful	things	,	just	something	that	's	exquisitely	beautiful	,	that	's	universally	beautiful	.
Very	hard	to	find	.	Maybe	you	've	got	some	examples	of	it	.
Very	hard	to	find	something	that	,	to	everybody	,	is	a	very	beautiful	thing	,	without	a	certain	amount	of	information	packed	in	there	before	.
So	a	lot	of	it	tends	to	be	extrinsic	.
It	's	mediated	by	information	before	the	comprehension	.
Or	the	information	's	added	on	at	the	back	,	like	that	little	girl	's	drawing	that	I	showed	you	.
Now	when	talking	about	beauty	you	ca	n't	get	away	from	the	fact	that	a	lot	experiments	have	been	done	in	this	way	with	faces	and	what	have	you	.
And	one	of	the	most	tedious	ones	,	I	think	,	was	saying	that	beauty	was	about	symmetry	.
Well	it	obviously	is	n't	.
This	is	a	more	interesting	one	where	half	faces	were	shown	to	some	people	,	and	then	to	add	them	into	a	list	of	most	beautiful	to	least	beautiful	and	then	exposing	a	full	face	.
And	they	found	that	it	was	almost	exact	coincidence	.
So	it	was	n't	about	symmetry	.
In	fact	,	this	lady	has	a	particularly	asymmetrical	face	,	of	which	both	sides	are	beautiful	.
But	they	're	both	different	.
And	as	a	designer	,	I	ca	n't	help	meddling	with	this	,	so	I	pulled	it	to	bits	and	sort	of	did	stuff	like	this	,	and	tried	to	understand	what	the	individual	elements	were	,	but	feeling	it	as	I	go	.
Now	I	can	feel	a	sensation	of	delight	and	beauty	if	I	look	at	that	eye	.
I	'm	not	getting	it	off	the	eyebrow	.
And	the	earhole	is	n't	doing	it	to	me	at	all	.
So	I	do	n't	know	how	much	this	is	helping	me	,	but	it	's	helping	to	guide	me	to	the	places	where	the	signals	are	coming	off	.
And	as	I	say	,	I	'm	not	a	neuroscientist	,	but	to	understand	how	I	can	start	to	assemble	things	that	will	very	quickly	bypass	this	thinking	part	and	get	me	to	the	enjoyable	precognitive	elements	.
Anais	Nin	and	the	Talmud	have	told	us	time	and	time	again	that	we	see	things	not	as	they	are	,	but	as	we	are	.
So	I	'm	going	to	shamelessly	expose	something	to	you	,	which	is	beautiful	to	me	.
And	this	is	the	F1	MV	Agusta	.
Ahhhh	.
It	is	really	--	I	mean	,	I	ca	n't	express	to	you	how	exquisite	this	object	is	.
But	I	also	know	why	it	's	exquisite	to	me	,	because	it	's	a	palimpsest	of	things	.
It	's	masses	and	masses	of	layers	.
This	is	just	the	bit	that	protrudes	into	our	physical	dimension	.
It	's	something	much	bigger	.
Layer	after	layer	of	legend	,	sport	,	details	that	resonate	.
I	mean	,	if	I	just	go	through	some	of	them	now	--	I	know	about	laminar	flow	when	it	comes	to	air-piercing	objects	,	and	that	does	it	consummately	well	,	you	can	see	it	can	.
So	that	's	getting	me	excited	.
And	I	feel	that	here	.
This	bit	,	the	big	secret	of	automotive	design	--	reflection	management	.
It	's	not	about	the	shapes	,	it	's	how	the	shapes	reflect	light	.
Now	that	thing	,	light	flickers	across	it	as	you	move	,	so	it	becomes	a	kinetic	object	,	even	though	it	's	standing	still	--	managed	by	how	brilliantly	that	's	done	on	the	reflection	.
This	little	relief	on	the	footplate	,	by	the	way	,	to	a	rider	means	there	's	something	going	on	underneath	it	--	in	this	case	,	a	drive	chain	running	at	300	miles	and	hour	probably	,	taking	the	power	from	the	engine	.
I	'm	getting	terribly	excited	as	my	mind	and	my	eyes	flick	across	these	things	.
Titanium	lacquer	on	this	.
I	ca	n't	tell	you	how	wonderful	this	is	.	That	's	how	you	stop	the	nuts	coming	off	at	high	speed	on	the	wheel	.
I	'm	really	getting	into	this	now	.
And	of	course	,	a	racing	bike	does	n't	have	a	prop	stand	,	but	this	one	,	because	it	's	a	road	bike	,	it	all	goes	away	and	it	folds	into	this	little	gap	.
So	it	disappears	.
And	then	I	ca	n't	tell	you	how	hard	it	is	to	do	that	radiator	,	which	is	curved	.	Why	would	you	do	that	?
Because	I	know	we	need	to	bring	the	wheel	farther	into	the	aerodynamics	.
So	it	's	more	expensive	,	but	it	's	wonderful	.
And	to	cap	it	all	,	brand	royalty	--	Agusta	,	Count	Agusta	,	from	the	great	histories	of	this	stuff	.
The	bit	that	you	ca	n't	see	is	the	genius	that	created	this	.
Massimo	Tamburini	.
They	call	him	``	The	Plumber	''	in	Italy	,	as	well	as	``	Maestro	,	''	because	he	actually	is	engineer	and	craftsman	and	sculptor	at	the	same	time	.
There	's	so	little	compromise	on	this	,	you	ca	n't	see	it	.
But	unfortunately	,	the	likes	of	me	and	people	that	are	like	me	have	to	deal	with	compromise	all	the	time	with	beauty	.
We	have	to	deal	with	it	.
So	I	have	to	work	with	a	supply	chain	,	and	I	've	got	to	work	with	the	technologies	,	and	I	've	got	to	work	with	everything	else	all	the	time	,	and	so	compromises	start	to	fit	into	it	.
And	so	look	at	her	.
I	've	had	to	make	a	bit	of	a	compromise	there	.
I	've	had	to	move	that	part	across	,	but	only	a	millimeter	.
No	one	's	noticed	,	have	they	yet	?
Did	you	see	what	I	did	?
I	moved	three	things	by	a	millimeter	.
Pretty	?	Yes	.
Beautiful	?	Maybe	lesser	.
But	then	,	of	course	,	the	consumer	says	that	does	n't	really	matter	.
So	that	's	okay	,	is	n't	it	?
Another	millimeter	?
No	one	's	going	to	notice	those	split	lines	and	changes	.
It	's	that	easy	to	lose	beauty	,
because	beauty	's	incredibly	difficult	to	do	.
And	only	a	few	people	can	do	it	.
And	a	focus	group	can	not	do	it	.
And	a	team	rarely	can	do	it	.
It	takes	a	central	cortex	,	if	you	like	,	to	be	able	to	orchestrate	all	those	elements	at	the	same	time	.
This	is	a	beautiful	water	bottle	--	some	of	you	know	of	it	--	done	by	Ross	Lovegrove	,	the	designer	.
This	is	pretty	close	to	intrinsic	beauty	.	This	one	,	as	long	as	you	know	what	water	is	like	then	you	can	experience	this	.
It	's	lovely	because	it	is	an	embodiment	of	something	refreshing	and	delicious	.
I	might	like	it	more	than	you	like	it	,	because	I	know	how	bloody	hard	it	is	to	do	it	.
It	's	stupefyingly	difficult	to	make	something	that	refracts	light	like	that	,	that	comes	out	of	the	tool	correctly	,	that	goes	down	the	line	without	falling	over	.
Underneath	this	,	like	the	story	of	the	swan	,	is	a	million	things	very	difficult	to	do	.
So	all	hail	to	that	.
It	's	a	fantastic	example	,	a	simple	object	.
And	the	one	I	showed	you	before	was	,	of	course	,	a	massively	complex	one	.
And	they	're	working	in	beauty	in	slightly	different	ways	because	of	it	.
You	all	,	I	guess	,	like	me	,	enjoy	watching	a	ballet	dancer	dance	.
And	part	of	the	joy	of	it	is	,	you	know	the	difficulty	.
You	also	may	be	taking	into	account	the	fact	that	it	's	incredibly	painful	.
Anybody	seen	a	ballet	dancer	's	toes	when	they	come	out	of	the	points	?
While	she	's	doing	these	graceful	arabesques	and	plies	and	what	have	you	,	something	horrible	's	going	on	down	here	.
The	comprehension	of	it	leads	us	to	a	greater	and	heightened	sense	of	the	beauty	of	what	's	actually	going	on	.
Now	I	'm	using	microseconds	wrongly	here	,	so	please	ignore	me	.
But	what	I	have	to	do	now	,	feeling	again	,	what	I	've	got	to	do	is	to	be	able	to	supply	enough	of	these	enzymes	,	of	these	triggers	into	something	early	on	in	the	process	,	that	you	pick	it	up	,	not	through	your	thinking	,	but	through	your	feeling	.
So	we	're	going	to	have	a	little	experiment	.
Right	,	are	you	ready	?	I	'm	going	to	show	you	something	for	a	very	,	very	brief	moment	.
Are	you	ready	?	Okay	.
Did	you	think	that	was	a	bicycle	when	I	showed	it	to	you	at	the	first	flash	?
It	's	not	.
Tell	me	something	,	did	you	think	it	was	quick	when	you	first	saw	it	?	Yes	you	did	.
Did	you	think	it	was	modern	?	Yes	you	did	.
That	blip	,	that	information	,	shot	into	you	before	that	.
And	because	your	brain	starter	motor	began	there	,	now	it	's	got	to	deal	with	it	.
And	the	great	thing	is	,	this	motorcycle	has	been	styled	this	way	specifically	to	engender	a	sense	that	it	's	green	technology	and	it	's	good	for	you	and	it	's	light	and	it	's	all	part	of	the	future	.
So	is	that	wrong	?
Well	in	this	case	it	is	n't	,	because	it	's	a	very	,	very	ecologically-sound	piece	of	technology	.
But	you	're	a	slave	of	that	first	flash	.
We	are	slaves	to	the	first	few	fractions	of	a	second	--	and	that	's	where	much	of	my	work	has	to	win	or	lose	,	on	a	shelf	in	a	shop	.
It	wins	or	loses	at	that	point	.
You	may	see	50	,	100	,	200	things	on	a	shelf	as	you	walk	down	it	,	but	I	have	to	work	within	that	domain	,	to	ensure	that	it	gets	you	there	first	.
And	finally	,	the	layer	that	I	love	,	of	knowledge	.
Some	of	you	,	I	'm	sure	,	will	be	familiar	with	this	.
What	's	incredible	about	this	,	and	the	way	I	love	to	come	back	to	it	,	is	this	is	taking	something	that	you	hate	or	bores	you	,	folding	clothes	,	and	if	you	can	actually	do	this	--	who	can	actually	do	this	?	Anybody	try	to	do	this	?
Yeah	?
It	's	fantastic	,	is	n't	it	?
Look	at	that	.	Do	you	want	to	see	it	again	?
No	time	.	It	says	I	have	two	minutes	left	,	so	we	ca	n't	do	this	.
But	just	go	to	the	Web	,	YouTube	,	pull	it	down	,	``	folding	T-shirt	.	''	That	's	how	underpaid	younger-aged	people	have	to	fold	your	T-shirt	.
You	did	n't	maybe	know	it	.
But	how	do	you	feel	about	it	?
It	feels	fantastic	when	you	do	it	,	you	look	forward	to	doing	it	,	and	when	you	tell	somebody	else	about	it	--	like	you	probably	have	--	you	look	really	smart	.
The	knowledge	bubble	that	sits	around	the	outside	,	the	stuff	that	costs	nothing	,
because	that	knowledge	is	free	--	bundle	that	together	and	where	do	we	come	out	?
Form	follows	function	?
Only	sometimes	.	Only	sometimes	.	Form	is	function	.	Form	is	function	.
It	informs	,	it	tells	us	,	it	supplies	us	answers	before	we	've	even	thought	about	it	.
And	so	I	've	stopped	using	words	like	``	form	,	''	and	I	've	stopped	using	words	like	``	function	''	as	a	designer	.
What	I	try	to	pursue	now	is	the	emotional	functionality	of	things	.	Because	if	I	can	get	that	right	,	I	can	make	them	wonderful	,	and	I	can	make	them	repeatedly	wonderful	.
And	you	know	what	those	products	and	services	are	,	because	you	own	some	of	them	.
They	're	the	things	that	you	'd	snatch	if	the	house	was	on	fire	.
Forming	the	emotional	bond	between	this	thing	and	you	is	an	electrochemical	party	trick	that	happens	before	you	even	think	about	it	.
Thank	you	very	much	.
One	of	the	most	common	ways	of	dividing	the	world	is	into	those	who	believe	and	those	who	do	n't	--	into	the	religious	and	the	atheists	.
And	for	the	last	decade	or	so	,	it	's	been	quite	clear	what	being	an	atheist	means	.
There	have	been	some	very	vocal	atheists	who	've	pointed	out	,	not	just	that	religion	is	wrong	,	but	that	it	's	ridiculous	.
These	people	,	many	of	whom	have	lived	in	North	Oxford	,	have	argued	--	they	've	argued	that	believing	in	God	is	akin	to	believing	in	fairies	and	essentially	that	the	whole	thing	is	a	childish	game	.
Now	I	think	it	's	too	easy	.
I	think	it	's	too	easy	to	dismiss	the	whole	of	religion	that	way	.
And	it	's	as	easy	as	shooting	fish	in	a	barrel	.
And	what	I	'd	like	to	inaugurate	today	is	a	new	way	of	being	an	atheist	--	if	you	like	,	a	new	version	of	atheism	we	could	call	Atheism	2.0	.
Now	what	is	Atheism	2.0	?
Well	it	starts	from	a	very	basic	premise	:	of	course	,	there	's	no	God	.
Of	course	,	there	are	no	deities	or	supernatural	spirits	or	angels	,	etc	.
Now	let	's	move	on	;	that	's	not	the	end	of	the	story	,	that	's	the	very	,	very	beginning	.
I	'm	interested	in	the	kind	of	constituency	that	thinks	something	along	these	lines	:	that	thinks	,	``	I	ca	n't	believe	in	any	of	this	stuff	.
I	ca	n't	believe	in	the	doctrines	.
I	do	n't	think	these	doctrines	are	right	.
But	,	''	a	very	important	but	,	``	I	love	Christmas	carols	.
I	really	like	the	art	of	Mantegna	.
I	really	like	looking	at	old	churches	.
I	really	like	turning	the	pages	of	the	Old	Testament	.	''	Whatever	it	may	be	,	you	know	the	kind	of	thing	I	'm	talking	about	--	people	who	are	attracted	to	the	ritualistic	side	,	the	moralistic	,	communal	side	of	religion	,	but	ca	n't	bear	the	doctrine	.
Until	now	,	these	people	have	faced	a	rather	unpleasant	choice	.
It	's	almost	as	though	either	you	accept	the	doctrine	and	then	you	can	have	all	the	nice	stuff	,	or	you	reject	the	doctrine	and	you	're	living	in	some	kind	of	spiritual	wasteland	under	the	guidance	of	CNN	and	Walmart	.
So	that	's	a	sort	of	tough	choice	.
I	do	n't	think	we	have	to	make	that	choice	.
I	think	there	is	an	alternative	.
I	think	there	are	ways	--	and	I	'm	being	both	very	respectful	and	completely	impious	--	of	stealing	from	religions	.
If	you	do	n't	believe	in	a	religion	,	there	's	nothing	wrong	with	picking	and	mixing	,	with	taking	out	the	best	sides	of	religion	.
And	for	me	,	atheism	2.0	is	about	both	,	as	I	say	,	a	respectful	and	an	impious	way	of	going	through	religions	and	saying	,	``	What	here	could	we	use	?	''	The	secular	world	is	full	of	holes	.
We	have	secularized	badly	,	I	would	argue	.
And	a	thorough	study	of	religion	could	give	us	all	sorts	of	insights	into	areas	of	life	that	are	not	going	too	well	.
And	I	'd	like	to	run	through	a	few	of	these	today	.
I	'd	like	to	kick	off	by	looking	at	education	.
Now	education	is	a	field	the	secular	world	really	believes	in	.
When	we	think	about	how	we	're	going	to	make	the	world	a	better	place	,	we	think	education	;	that	's	where	we	put	a	lot	of	money	.
Education	is	going	to	give	us	,	not	only	commercial	skills	,	industrial	skills	,	it	's	also	going	to	make	us	better	people	.
You	know	the	kind	of	thing	a	commencement	address	is	,	and	graduation	ceremonies	,	those	lyrical	claims	that	education	,	the	process	of	education	--	particularly	higher	education	--	will	make	us	into	nobler	and	better	human	beings	.
That	's	a	lovely	idea	.
Interesting	where	it	came	from	.
In	the	early	19th	century	,	church	attendance	in	Western	Europe	started	sliding	down	very	,	very	sharply	,	and	people	panicked	.
They	asked	themselves	the	following	question	.	They	said	,	where	are	people	going	to	find	the	morality	,	where	are	they	going	to	find	guidance	,	and	where	are	they	going	to	find	sources	of	consolation	?
And	influential	voices	came	up	with	one	answer	.
They	said	culture	.
It	's	to	culture	that	we	should	look	for	guidance	,	for	consolation	,	for	morality	.
Let	's	look	to	the	plays	of	Shakespeare	,	the	dialogues	of	Plato	,	the	novels	of	Jane	Austen	.
In	there	,	we	'll	find	a	lot	of	the	truths	that	we	might	previously	have	found	in	the	Gospel	of	Saint	John	.
Now	I	think	that	's	a	very	beautiful	idea	and	a	very	true	idea	.
They	wanted	to	replace	scripture	with	culture	.
And	that	's	a	very	plausible	idea	.
It	's	also	an	idea	that	we	have	forgotten	.
If	you	went	to	a	top	university	--	let	's	say	you	went	to	Harvard	or	Oxford	or	Cambridge	--	and	you	said	,	``	I	've	come	here	because	I	'm	in	search	of	morality	,	guidance	and	consolation	;	I	want	to	know	how	to	live	,	''	they	would	show	you	the	way	to	the	insane	asylum	.
This	is	simply	not	what	our	grandest	and	best	institutes	of	higher	learning	are	in	the	business	of	.
Why	?	They	do	n't	think	we	need	it	.
They	do	n't	think	we	are	in	an	urgent	need	of	assistance	.
They	see	us	as	adults	,	rational	adults	.
What	we	need	is	information	.
We	need	data	,	we	do	n't	need	help	.
Now	religions	start	from	a	very	different	place	indeed	.
All	religions	,	all	major	religions	,	at	various	points	call	us	children	.
And	like	children	,	they	believe	that	we	are	in	severe	need	of	assistance	.
We	're	only	just	holding	it	together	.
Perhaps	this	is	just	me	,	maybe	you	.
But	anyway	,	we	're	only	just	holding	it	together	.
And	we	need	help	.	Of	course	,	we	need	help	.
And	so	we	need	guidance	and	we	need	didactic	learning	.
You	know	,	in	the	18th	century	in	the	U.K.	,	the	greatest	preacher	,	greatest	religious	preacher	,	was	a	man	called	John	Wesley	,	who	went	up	and	down	this	country	delivering	sermons	,	advising	people	how	they	could	live	.
He	delivered	sermons	on	the	duties	of	parents	to	their	children	and	children	to	their	parents	,	the	duties	of	the	rich	to	the	poor	and	the	poor	to	the	rich	.
He	was	trying	to	tell	people	how	they	should	live	through	the	medium	of	sermons	,	the	classic	medium	of	delivery	of	religions	.
Now	we	've	given	up	with	the	idea	of	sermons	.
If	you	said	to	a	modern	liberal	individualist	,	``	Hey	,	how	about	a	sermon	?	''	they	'd	go	,	``	No	,	no	.	I	do	n't	need	one	of	those	.
I	'm	an	independent	,	individual	person	.	''	What	's	the	difference	between	a	sermon	and	our	modern	,	secular	mode	of	delivery	,	the	lecture	?
Well	a	sermon	wants	to	change	your	life	and	a	lecture	wants	to	give	you	a	bit	of	information	.
And	I	think	we	need	to	get	back	to	that	sermon	tradition	.
The	tradition	of	sermonizing	is	hugely	valuable	,	because	we	are	in	need	of	guidance	,	morality	and	consolation	--	and	religions	know	that	.
Another	point	about	education	:	we	tend	to	believe	in	the	modern	secular	world	that	if	you	tell	someone	something	once	,	they	'll	remember	it	.
Sit	them	in	a	classroom	,	tell	them	about	Plato	at	the	age	of	20	,	send	them	out	for	a	career	in	management	consultancy	for	40	years	,	and	that	lesson	will	stick	with	them	.
Religions	go	,	``	Nonsense	.
You	need	to	keep	repeating	the	lesson	10	times	a	day	.
So	get	on	your	knees	and	repeat	it	.	''	That	's	what	all	religions	tell	us	:	``	Get	on	you	knees	and	repeat	it	10	or	20	or	15	times	a	day	.	''	Otherwise	our	minds	are	like	sieves	.
So	religions	are	cultures	of	repetition	.
They	circle	the	great	truths	again	and	again	and	again	.
We	associate	repetition	with	boredom	.
``	Give	us	the	new	,	''	we	're	always	saying	.
``	The	new	is	better	than	the	old	.	''
If	I	said	to	you	,	``	Okay	,	we	're	not	going	to	have	new	TED	.
We	're	just	going	to	run	through	all	the	old	ones	and	watch	them	five	times	because	they	're	so	true	.
We	're	going	to	watch	Elizabeth	Gilbert	five	times	because	what	she	says	is	so	clever	,	''	you	'd	feel	cheated	.
Not	so	if	you	're	adopting	a	religious	mindset	.
The	other	things	that	religions	do	is	to	arrange	time	.
All	the	major	religions	give	us	calendars	.
What	is	a	calendar	?
A	calendar	is	a	way	of	making	sure	that	across	the	year	you	will	bump	into	certain	very	important	ideas	.
In	the	Catholic	chronology	,	Catholic	calendar	,	at	the	end	of	March	you	will	think	about	St.	Jerome	and	his	qualities	of	humility	and	goodness	and	his	generosity	to	the	poor	.
You	wo	n't	do	that	by	accident	;	you	will	do	that	because	you	are	guided	to	do	that	.
Now	we	do	n't	think	that	way	.
In	the	secular	world	we	think	,	``	If	an	idea	is	important	,	I	'll	bump	into	it	.
I	'll	just	come	across	it	.	''	Nonsense	,	says	the	religious	world	view	.
Religious	view	says	we	need	calendars	,	we	need	to	structure	time	,	we	need	to	synchronize	encounters	.
This	comes	across	also	in	the	way	in	which	religions	set	up	rituals	around	important	feelings	.
Take	the	Moon	.	It	's	really	important	to	look	at	the	Moon	.
You	know	,	when	you	look	at	the	Moon	,	you	think	,	``	I	'm	really	small	.	What	are	my	problems	?	''	It	sets	things	into	perspective	,	etc.	,	etc	.
We	should	all	look	at	the	Moon	a	bit	more	often	.	We	do	n't	.
Why	do	n't	we	?	Well	there	's	nothing	to	tell	us	,	``	Look	at	the	Moon	.	''	But	if	you	're	a	Zen	Buddhist	in	the	middle	of	September	,	you	will	be	ordered	out	of	your	home	,	made	to	stand	on	a	canonical	platform	and	made	to	celebrate	the	festival	of	Tsukimi	,	where	you	will	be	given	poems	to	read	in	honor	of	the	Moon	and	the	passage	of	time	and	the	frailty	of	life	that	it	should	remind	us	of	.
You	'll	be	handed	rice	cakes	.
And	the	Moon	and	the	reflection	on	the	Moon	will	have	a	secure	place	in	your	heart	.
That	's	very	good	.
The	other	thing	that	religions	are	really	aware	of	is	:	speak	well	--	I	'm	not	doing	a	very	good	job	of	this	here	--	but	oratory	,	oratory	is	absolutely	key	to	religions	.
In	the	secular	world	,	you	can	come	through	the	university	system	and	be	a	lousy	speaker	and	still	have	a	great	career	.
But	the	religious	world	does	n't	think	that	way	.
What	you	're	saying	needs	to	be	backed	up	by	a	really	convincing	way	of	saying	it	.
So	if	you	go	to	an	African	American	Pentecostalist	church	in	the	American	South	and	you	listen	to	how	they	talk	,	my	goodness	,	they	talk	well	.
After	every	convincing	point	,	people	will	go	,	``	Amen	,	amen	,	amen	.	''	At	the	end	of	a	really	rousing	paragraph	,	they	'll	all	stand	up	,	and	they	'll	go	,	``	Thank	you	Jesus	,	thank	you	Christ	,	thank	you	Savior	.	''	If	we	were	doing	it	like	they	do	it	--	let	's	not	do	it	,	but	if	we	were	to	do	it	--	I	would	tell	you	something	like	,	``	Culture	should	replace	scripture	.	''	And	you	would	go	,	``	Amen	,	amen	,	amen	.	''	And	at	the	end	of	my	talk	,	you	would	all	stand	up	and	you	would	go	,	``	Thank	you	Plato	,	thank	you	Shakespeare	,	thank	you	Jane	Austen	.	''	And	we	'd	know	that	we	had	a	real	rhythm	going	.
All	right	,	all	right	.	We	're	getting	there	.	We	're	getting	there	.
The	other	thing	that	religions	know	is	we	're	not	just	brains	,	we	are	also	bodies	.
And	when	they	teach	us	a	lesson	,	they	do	it	via	the	body	.
So	for	example	,	take	the	Jewish	idea	of	forgiveness	.
Jews	are	very	interested	in	forgiveness	and	how	we	should	start	anew	and	start	afresh	.
They	do	n't	just	deliver	us	sermons	on	this	.
They	do	n't	just	give	us	books	or	words	about	this	.
They	tell	us	to	have	a	bath	.
So	in	Orthodox	Jewish	communities	,	every	Friday	you	go	to	a	Mikveh	.
You	immerse	yourself	in	the	water	,	and	a	physical	action	backs	up	a	philosophical	idea	.
We	do	n't	tend	to	do	that	.
Our	ideas	are	in	one	area	and	our	behavior	with	our	bodies	is	in	another	.
Religions	are	fascinating	in	the	way	they	try	and	combine	the	two	.
Let	's	look	at	art	now	.
Now	art	is	something	that	in	the	secular	world	,	we	think	very	highly	of	.	We	think	art	is	really	,	really	important	.
A	lot	of	our	surplus	wealth	goes	to	museums	,	etc	.
We	sometimes	hear	it	said	that	museums	are	our	new	cathedrals	,	or	our	new	churches	.
You	've	heard	that	saying	.
Now	I	think	that	the	potential	is	there	,
but	we	've	completely	let	ourselves	down	.
And	the	reason	we	've	let	ourselves	down	is	that	we	're	not	properly	studying	how	religions	handle	art	.
The	two	really	bad	ideas	that	are	hovering	in	the	modern	world	that	inhibit	our	capacity	to	draw	strength	from	art	:	The	first	idea	is	that	art	should	be	for	art	's	sake	--	a	ridiculous	idea	--	an	idea	that	art	should	live	in	a	hermetic	bubble	and	should	not	try	to	do	anything	with	this	troubled	world	.
I	could	n't	disagree	more	.
The	other	thing	that	we	believe	is	that	art	should	n't	explain	itself	,	that	artists	should	n't	say	what	they	're	up	to	,	because	if	they	said	it	,	it	might	destroy	the	spell	and	we	might	find	it	too	easy	.
That	's	why	a	very	common	feeling	when	you	're	in	a	museum	--	let	's	admit	it	--	is	,	``	I	do	n't	know	what	this	is	about	.	''	But	if	we	're	serious	people	,	we	do	n't	admit	to	that	.
But	that	feeling	of	puzzlement	is	structural	to	contemporary	art	.
Now	religions	have	a	much	saner	attitude	to	art	.
They	have	no	trouble	telling	us	what	art	is	about	.
Art	is	about	two	things	in	all	the	major	faiths	.
Firstly	,	it	's	trying	to	remind	you	of	what	there	is	to	love	.
And	secondly	,	it	's	trying	to	remind	you	of	what	there	is	to	fear	and	to	hate	.
And	that	's	what	art	is	.
Art	is	a	visceral	encounter	with	the	most	important	ideas	of	your	faith	.
So	as	you	walk	around	a	church	,	or	a	mosque	or	a	cathedral	,	what	you	're	trying	to	imbibe	,	what	you	're	imbibing	is	,	through	your	eyes	,	through	your	senses	,	truths	that	have	otherwise	come	to	you	through	your	mind	.
Essentially	it	's	propaganda	.
Rembrandt	is	a	propagandist	in	the	Christian	view	.
Now	the	word	``	propaganda	''	sets	off	alarm	bells	.
We	think	of	Hitler	,	we	think	of	Stalin	.	Do	n't	,	necessarily	.
Propaganda	is	a	manner	of	being	didactic	in	honor	of	something	.
And	if	that	thing	is	good	,	there	's	no	problem	with	it	at	all	.
My	view	is	that	museums	should	take	a	leaf	out	of	the	book	of	religions	.
And	they	should	make	sure	that	when	you	walk	into	a	museum	--	if	I	was	a	museum	curator	,	I	would	make	a	room	for	love	,	a	room	for	generosity	.
All	works	of	art	are	talking	to	us	about	things	.
And	if	we	were	able	to	arrange	spaces	where	we	could	come	across	works	where	we	would	be	told	,	use	these	works	of	art	to	cement	these	ideas	in	your	mind	,	we	would	get	a	lot	more	out	of	art	.
Art	would	pick	up	the	duty	that	it	used	to	have	and	that	we	've	neglected	because	of	certain	mis-founded	ideas	.
Art	should	be	one	of	the	tools	by	which	we	improve	our	society	.
Art	should	be	didactic	.
Let	's	think	of	something	else	.
The	people	in	the	modern	world	,	in	the	secular	world	,	who	are	interested	in	matters	of	the	spirit	,	in	matters	of	the	mind	,	in	higher	soul-like	concerns	,	tend	to	be	isolated	individuals	.
They	're	poets	,	they	're	philosophers	,	they	're	photographers	,	they	're	filmmakers	.
And	they	tend	to	be	on	their	own	.
They	're	our	cottage	industries	.	They	are	vulnerable	,	single	people	.
And	they	get	depressed	and	they	get	sad	on	their	own	.
And	they	do	n't	really	change	much	.
Now	think	about	religions	,	think	about	organized	religions	.
What	do	organized	religions	do	?
They	group	together	,	they	form	institutions	.
And	that	has	all	sorts	of	advantages	.
First	of	all	,	scale	,	might	.
The	Catholic	Church	pulled	in	97	billion	dollars	last	year	according	to	the	Wall	Street	Journal	.
These	are	massive	machines	.
They	're	collaborative	,	they	're	branded	,	they	're	multinational	,	and	they	're	highly	disciplined	.
These	are	all	very	good	qualities	.
We	recognize	them	in	relation	to	corporations	.
And	corporations	are	very	like	religions	in	many	ways	,	except	they	're	right	down	at	the	bottom	of	the	pyramid	of	needs	.
They	're	selling	us	shoes	and	cars	.
Whereas	the	people	who	are	selling	us	the	higher	stuff	--	the	therapists	,	the	poets	--	are	on	their	own	and	they	have	no	power	,	they	have	no	might	.
So	religions	are	the	foremost	example	of	an	institution	that	is	fighting	for	the	things	of	the	mind	.
Now	we	may	not	agree	with	what	religions	are	trying	to	teach	us	,	but	we	can	admire	the	institutional	way	in	which	they	're	doing	it	.
Books	alone	,	books	written	by	lone	individuals	,	are	not	going	to	change	anything	.
We	need	to	group	together	.
If	you	want	to	change	the	world	,	you	have	to	group	together	,	you	have	to	be	collaborative	.
And	that	's	what	religions	do	.
They	are	multinational	,	as	I	say	,	they	are	branded	,	they	have	a	clear	identity	,	so	they	do	n't	get	lost	in	a	busy	world	.
That	's	something	we	can	learn	from	.
I	want	to	conclude	.
Really	what	I	want	to	say	is	for	many	of	you	who	are	operating	in	a	range	of	different	fields	,	there	is	something	to	learn	from	the	example	of	religion	--	even	if	you	do	n't	believe	any	of	it	.
If	you	're	involved	in	anything	that	's	communal	,	that	involves	lots	of	people	getting	together	,	there	are	things	for	you	in	religion	.
If	you	're	involved	,	say	,	in	a	travel	industry	in	any	way	,	look	at	pilgrimage	.
Look	very	closely	at	pilgrimage	.
We	have	n't	begun	to	scratch	the	surface	of	what	travel	could	be	because	we	have	n't	looked	at	what	religions	do	with	travel	.
If	you	're	in	the	art	world	,	look	at	the	example	of	what	religions	are	doing	with	art	.
And	if	you	're	an	educator	in	any	way	,	again	,	look	at	how	religions	are	spreading	ideas	.
You	may	not	agree	with	the	ideas	,	but	my	goodness	,	they	're	highly	effective	mechanisms	for	doing	so	.
So	really	my	concluding	point	is	you	may	not	agree	with	religion	,	but	at	the	end	of	the	day	,	religions	are	so	subtle	,	so	complicated	,	so	intelligent	in	many	ways	that	they	're	not	fit	to	be	abandoned	to	the	religious	alone	;	they	're	for	all	of	us	.
Thank	you	very	much	.
Chris	Anderson	:	Now	this	is	actually	a	courageous	talk	,	because	you	're	kind	of	setting	up	yourself	in	some	ways	to	be	ridiculed	in	some	quarters	.
AB	:	You	can	get	shot	by	both	sides	.
You	can	get	shot	by	the	hard-headed	atheists	,	and	you	can	get	shot	by	those	who	fully	believe	.
CA	:	Incoming	missiles	from	North	Oxford	at	any	moment	.
AB	:	Indeed	.
CA	:	But	you	left	out	one	aspect	of	religion	that	a	lot	of	people	might	say	your	agenda	could	borrow	from	,	which	is	this	sense	--	that	's	actually	probably	the	most	important	thing	to	anyone	who	's	religious	--	of	spiritual	experience	,	of	some	kind	of	connection	with	something	that	's	bigger	than	you	are	.
Is	there	any	room	for	that	experience	in	Atheism	2.0	?
AB	:	Absolutely	.	I	,	like	many	of	you	,	meet	people	who	say	things	like	,	``	But	is	n't	there	something	bigger	than	us	,	something	else	?	''	And	I	say	,	``	Of	course	.	''	And	they	say	,	``	So	are	n't	you	sort	of	religious	?	''	And	I	go	,	``	No	.	''	Why	does	that	sense	of	mystery	,	that	sense	of	the	dizzying	scale	of	the	universe	,	need	to	be	accompanied	by	a	mystical	feeling	?
Science	and	just	observation	gives	us	that	feeling	without	it	,	so	I	do	n't	feel	the	need	.
The	universe	is	large	and	we	are	tiny	,	without	the	need	for	further	religious	superstructure	.
So	one	can	have	so-called	spiritual	moments	without	belief	in	the	spirit	.
CA	:	Actually	,	let	me	just	ask	a	question	.
How	many	people	here	would	say	that	religion	is	important	to	them	?
Is	there	an	equivalent	process	by	which	there	's	a	sort	of	bridge	between	what	you	're	talking	about	and	what	you	would	say	to	them	?
AB	:	I	would	say	that	there	are	many	,	many	gaps	in	secular	life	and	these	can	be	plugged	.
It	's	not	as	though	,	as	I	try	to	suggest	,	it	's	not	as	though	either	you	have	religion	and	then	you	have	to	accept	all	sorts	of	things	,	or	you	do	n't	have	religion	and	then	you	're	cut	off	from	all	these	very	good	things	.
It	's	so	sad	that	we	constantly	say	,	``	I	do	n't	believe	so	I	ca	n't	have	community	,	so	I	'm	cut	off	from	morality	,	so	I	ca	n't	go	on	a	pilgrimage	.	''	One	wants	to	say	,	``	Nonsense	.	Why	not	?	''	And	that	's	really	the	spirit	of	my	talk	.
There	's	so	much	we	can	absorb	.
Atheism	should	n't	cut	itself	off	from	the	rich	sources	of	religion	.
CA	:	It	seems	to	me	that	there	's	plenty	of	people	in	the	TED	community	who	are	atheists	.
But	probably	most	people	in	the	community	certainly	do	n't	think	that	religion	is	going	away	any	time	soon	and	want	to	find	the	language	to	have	a	constructive	dialogue	and	to	feel	like	we	can	actually	talk	to	each	other	and	at	least	share	some	things	in	common	.
Are	we	foolish	to	be	optimistic	about	the	possibility	of	a	world	where	,	instead	of	religion	being	the	great	rallying	cry	of	divide	and	war	,	that	there	could	be	bridging	?
AB	:	No	,	we	need	to	be	polite	about	differences	.
Politeness	is	a	much-overlooked	virtue	.
It	's	seen	as	hypocrisy	.
But	we	need	to	get	to	a	stage	when	you	're	an	atheist	and	someone	says	,	``	Well	you	know	,	I	did	pray	the	other	day	,	''	you	politely	ignore	it	.
You	move	on	.
Because	you	've	agreed	on	90	percent	of	things	,	because	you	have	a	shared	view	on	so	many	things	,	and	you	politely	differ	.
And	I	think	that	's	what	the	religious	wars	of	late	have	ignored	.
They	've	ignored	the	possibility	of	harmonious	disagreement	.
CA	:	And	finally	,	does	this	new	thing	that	you	're	proposing	that	's	not	a	religion	but	something	else	,	does	it	need	a	leader	,	and	are	you	volunteering	to	be	the	pope	?
AB	:	Well	,	one	thing	that	we	're	all	very	suspicious	of	is	individual	leaders	.
It	does	n't	need	it	.
What	I	've	tried	to	lay	out	is	a	framework	and	I	'm	hoping	that	people	can	just	fill	it	in	.
I	've	sketched	a	sort	of	broad	framework	.
But	wherever	you	are	,	as	I	say	,	if	you	're	in	the	travel	industry	,	do	that	travel	bit	.
If	you	're	in	the	communal	industry	,	look	at	religion	and	do	the	communal	bit	.
So	it	's	a	wiki	project	.
CA	:	Alain	,	thank	you	for	sparking	many	conversations	later	.
I	would	like	to	talk	today	about	what	I	think	is	one	of	the	greatest	adventures	human	beings	have	embarked	upon	,	which	is	the	quest	to	understand	the	universe	and	our	place	in	it	.
My	own	interest	in	this	subject	,	and	my	passion	for	it	,	began	rather	accidentally	.
I	had	bought	a	copy	of	this	book	,	``	The	Universe	and	Dr.	Einstein	''	--	a	used	paperback	from	a	secondhand	bookstore	in	Seattle	.
A	few	years	after	that	,	in	Bangalore	,	I	was	finding	it	hard	to	fall	asleep	one	night	,	and	I	picked	up	this	book	,	thinking	it	would	put	me	to	sleep	in	10	minutes	.
And	as	it	happened	,	I	read	it	from	midnight	to	five	in	the	morning	in	one	shot	.
And	I	was	left	with	this	intense	feeling	of	awe	and	exhilaration	at	the	universe	and	our	own	ability	to	understand	as	much	as	we	do	.
And	that	feeling	has	n't	left	me	yet	.
That	feeling	was	the	trigger	for	me	to	actually	change	my	career	--	from	being	a	software	engineer	to	become	a	science	writer	--	so	that	I	could	partake	in	the	joy	of	science	,	and	also	the	joy	of	communicating	it	to	others	.
And	that	feeling	also	led	me	to	a	pilgrimage	of	sorts	,	to	go	literally	to	the	ends	of	the	earth	to	see	telescopes	,	detectors	,	instruments	that	people	are	building	,	or	have	built	,	in	order	to	probe	the	cosmos	in	greater	and	greater	detail	.
So	it	took	me	from	places	like	Chile	--	the	Atacama	Desert	in	Chile	--	to	Siberia	,	to	underground	mines	in	the	Japanese	Alps	,	in	Northern	America	,	all	the	way	to	Antarctica	and	even	to	the	South	Pole	.
And	today	I	would	like	to	share	with	you	some	images	,	some	stories	of	these	trips	.
I	have	been	basically	spending	the	last	few	years	documenting	the	efforts	of	some	extremely	intrepid	men	and	women	who	are	putting	,	literally	at	times	,	their	lives	at	stake	working	in	some	very	remote	and	very	hostile	places	so	that	they	may	gather	the	faintest	signals	from	the	cosmos	in	order	for	us	to	understand	this	universe	.
And	I	first	begin	with	a	pie	chart	--	and	I	promise	this	is	the	only	pie	chart	in	the	whole	presentation	--
but	it	sets	up	the	state	of	our	knowledge	of	the	cosmos	.
All	the	theories	in	physics	that	we	have	today	properly	explain	what	is	called	normal	matter	--	the	stuff	that	we	're	all	made	of	--	and	that	's	four	percent	of	the	universe	.
Astronomers	and	cosmologists	and	physicists	think	that	there	is	something	called	dark	matter	in	the	universe	,	which	makes	up	23	percent	of	the	universe	,	and	something	called	dark	energy	,	which	permeates	the	fabric	of	space-time	,	that	makes	up	another	73	percent	.
So	if	you	look	at	this	pie	chart	,	96	percent	of	the	universe	,	at	this	point	in	our	exploration	of	it	,	is	unknown	or	not	well	understood	.
And	most	of	the	experiments	,	telescopes	that	I	went	to	see	are	in	some	way	addressing	this	question	,	these	two	twin	mysteries	of	dark	matter	and	dark	energy	.
I	will	take	you	first	to	an	underground	mine	in	Northern	Minnesota	where	people	are	looking	for	something	called	dark	matter	.
And	the	idea	here	is	that	they	are	looking	for	a	sign	of	a	dark	matter	particle	hitting	one	of	their	detectors	.
And	the	reason	why	they	have	to	go	underground	is	that	,	if	you	did	this	experiment	on	the	surface	of	the	Earth	,	the	same	experiment	would	be	swamped	by	signals	that	could	be	created	by	things	like	cosmic	rays	,	ambient	radio	activity	,	even	our	own	bodies	.	You	might	not	believe	it	,	but	even	our	own	bodies	are	radioactive	enough	to	disturb	this	experiment	.
So	they	go	deep	inside	mines	to	find	a	kind	of	environmental	silence	that	will	allow	them	to	hear	the	ping	of	a	dark	matter	particle	hitting	their	detector	.
And	I	went	to	see	one	of	these	experiments	,	and	this	is	actually	--	you	can	barely	see	it	,	and	the	reason	for	that	is	it	's	entirely	dark	in	there	--
this	is	a	cavern	that	was	left	behind	by	the	miners	who	left	this	mine	in	1960	.
And	physicists	came	and	started	using	it	sometime	in	the	1980s	.
And	the	miners	in	the	early	part	of	the	last	century	worked	,	literally	,	in	candlelight	.
And	today	,	you	would	see	this	inside	the	mine	,	half	a	mile	underground	.
This	is	one	of	the	largest	underground	labs	in	the	world	.
And	,	among	other	things	,	they	're	looking	for	dark	matter	.
There	is	another	way	to	search	for	dark	matter	,	which	is	indirectly	.
If	dark	matter	exists	in	our	universe	,	in	our	galaxy	,	then	these	particles	should	be	smashing	together	and	producing	other	particles	that	we	know	about	--	one	of	them	being	neutrinos	.
And	neutrinos	you	can	detect	by	the	signature	they	leave	when	they	hit	water	molecules	.
When	a	neutrino	hits	a	water	molecule	it	emits	a	kind	of	blue	light	,	a	flash	of	blue	light	,	and	by	looking	for	this	blue	light	,	you	can	essentially	understand	something	about	the	neutrino	and	then	,	indirectly	,	something	about	the	dark	matter	that	might	have	created	this	neutrino	.
But	you	need	very	,	very	large	volumes	of	water	in	order	to	do	this	.
You	need	something	like	tens	of	megatons	of	water	--	almost	a	gigaton	of	water	--	in	order	to	have	any	chance	of	catching	this	neutrino	.
And	where	in	the	world	would	you	find	such	water	?
Well	the	Russians	have	a	tank	in	their	own	backyard	.
This	is	Lake	Baikal	.
It	is	the	largest	lake	in	the	world	.	It	's	800	km	long	.
It	's	about	40	to	50	km	wide	in	most	places	,	and	one	to	two	kilometers	deep	.
And	what	the	Russians	are	doing	is	they	're	building	these	detectors	and	immersing	them	about	a	kilometer	beneath	the	surface	of	the	lake	so	that	they	can	watch	for	these	flashes	of	blue	light	.
And	this	is	the	scene	that	greeted	me	when	I	landed	there	.
This	is	Lake	Baikal	in	the	peak	of	the	Siberian	winter	.
The	lake	is	entirely	frozen	.
And	the	line	of	black	dots	that	you	see	in	the	background	,	that	's	the	ice	camp	where	the	physicists	are	working	.
The	reason	why	they	have	to	work	in	winter	is	because	they	do	n't	have	the	money	to	work	in	summer	and	spring	,	which	,	if	they	did	that	,	they	would	need	ships	and	submersibles	to	do	their	work	.
So	they	wait	until	winter	--	the	lake	is	completely	frozen	over	--	and	they	use	this	meter-thick	ice	as	a	platform	on	which	to	establish	their	ice	camp	and	do	their	work	.
So	this	is	the	Russians	working	on	the	ice	in	the	peak	of	the	Siberian	winter	.
They	have	to	drill	holes	in	the	ice	,	dive	down	into	the	water	--	cold	,	cold	water	--	to	get	hold	of	the	instrument	,	bring	it	up	,	do	any	repairs	and	maintenance	that	they	need	to	do	,	put	it	back	and	get	out	before	the	ice	melts	.
Because	that	phase	of	solid	ice	lasts	for	two	months	and	it	's	full	of	cracks	.
And	you	have	to	imagine	,	there	's	an	entire	sea-like	lake	underneath	,	moving	.
I	still	do	n't	understand	this	one	Russian	man	working	in	his	bare	chest	,	but	that	tells	you	how	hard	he	was	working	.
And	these	people	,	a	handful	of	people	,	have	been	working	for	20	years	,	looking	for	particles	that	may	or	may	not	exist	.	And	they	have	dedicated	their	lives	to	it	.
And	just	to	give	you	an	idea	,	they	have	spent	20	million	over	20	years	.
It	's	very	harsh	conditions	.
They	work	on	a	shoestring	budget	.
The	toilets	there	are	literally	holes	in	the	ground	covered	with	a	wooden	shack	.
And	it	's	that	basic	,	but	they	do	this	every	year	.
From	Siberia	to	the	Atacama	Desert	in	Chile	,	to	see	something	called	The	Very	Large	Telescope	.
The	Very	Large	Telescope	is	one	of	these	things	that	astronomers	do	--	they	name	their	telescopes	rather	unimaginatively	.
I	can	tell	you	for	a	fact	,	that	the	next	one	that	they	're	planning	is	called	The	Extremely	Large	Telescope	.
And	you	would	n't	believe	it	,	but	the	one	after	that	is	going	to	be	called	The	Overwhelmingly	Large	Telescope	.
But	nonetheless	,	it	's	an	extraordinary	piece	of	engineering	.
These	are	four	8.2	meter	telescopes	.
And	these	telescopes	,	among	other	things	,	they	're	being	used	to	study	how	the	expansion	of	the	universe	is	changing	with	time	.
And	the	more	you	understand	that	,	the	better	you	would	understand	what	this	dark	energy	that	the	universe	is	made	of	is	all	about	.
And	one	piece	of	engineering	that	I	want	to	leave	you	with	as	regards	this	telescope	is	the	mirror	.	Each	mirror	,	there	are	four	of	them	,	is	made	of	a	single	piece	of	glass	,	a	monolithic	piece	of	high-tech	ceramic	,	that	has	been	ground	down	and	polished	to	such	accuracy	that	the	only	way	to	understand	what	that	is	is	[	to	]	imagine	a	city	like	Paris	,	with	all	its	buildings	and	the	Eiffel	Tower	,
if	you	grind	down	Paris	to	that	kind	of	accuracy	,	you	would	be	left	with	bumps	that	are	one	millimeter	high	.
And	that	's	the	kind	of	polishing	that	these	mirrors	have	endured	.
An	extraordinary	set	of	telescopes	.
Here	's	another	view	of	the	same	.
The	reason	why	you	have	to	build	these	telescopes	in	places	like	the	Atacama	Desert	is	because	of	the	high	altitude	desert	.
The	dry	air	is	really	good	for	telescopes	,	and	also	,	the	cloud	cover	is	below	the	summit	of	these	mountains	so	that	the	telescopes	have	about	300	days	of	clear	skies	.
Finally	,	I	want	to	take	you	to	Antarctica	.
I	want	to	spend	most	of	my	time	on	this	part	of	the	world	.
This	is	cosmology	's	final	frontier	.
Some	of	the	most	amazing	experiments	,	some	of	the	most	extreme	experiments	,	are	being	done	in	Antarctica	.
I	was	there	to	view	something	called	a	long-duration	balloon	flight	,	which	basically	takes	telescopes	and	instruments	all	the	way	to	the	upper	atmosphere	,	the	upper	stratosphere	,	40	km	up	.
And	that	's	where	they	do	their	experiments	,	and	then	the	balloon	,	the	payload	,	is	brought	down	.
So	this	is	us	landing	on	the	Ross	Ice	Shelf	in	Antarctica	.
That	's	an	American	C-17	cargo	plane	that	flew	us	from	New	Zealand	to	McMurdo	in	Antarctica	.
And	here	we	are	about	to	board	our	bus	.
And	I	do	n't	know	if	you	can	read	the	lettering	,	but	it	says	,	``	Ivan	the	Terribus	.	''
And	that	's	taking	us	to	McMurdo	.
And	this	is	the	scene	that	greets	you	in	McMurdo	.
And	you	barely	might	be	able	to	make	out	this	hut	here	.
This	hut	was	built	by	Robert	Falcon	Scott	and	his	men	when	they	first	came	to	Antarctica	on	their	first	expedition	to	go	to	the	South	Pole	.
Because	it	's	so	cold	,	the	entire	contents	of	that	hut	is	still	as	they	left	it	,	with	the	remnants	of	the	last	meal	they	cooked	still	there	.
It	's	an	extraordinary	place	.
This	is	McMurdo	itself	.	About	a	thousand	people	work	here	in	summer	,	and	about	200	in	winter	when	it	's	completely	dark	for	six	months	.
I	was	here	to	see	the	launch	of	this	particular	type	of	instrument	.
This	is	a	cosmic	ray	experiment	that	has	been	launched	all	the	way	to	the	upper-stratosphere	to	an	altitude	of	40	km	.
What	I	want	you	to	imagine	is	this	is	two	tons	in	weight	.
So	you	're	using	a	balloon	to	carry	something	that	is	two	tons	all	the	way	to	an	altitude	of	40	km	.
And	the	engineers	,	the	technicians	,	the	physicists	have	all	got	to	assemble	on	the	Ross	Ice	Shelf	,	because	Antarctica	--	I	wo	n't	go	into	the	reasons	why	--	but	it	's	one	of	the	most	favorable	places	for	doing	these	balloon	launches	,	except	for	the	weather	.
The	weather	,	as	you	can	imagine	,
this	is	summer	,	and	you	're	standing	on	200	ft	of	ice	.
And	there	's	a	volcano	behind	,	which	has	glaciers	at	the	very	top	.
And	what	they	have	to	do	is	they	have	to	assemble	the	entire	balloon	--	the	fabric	,	parachute	and	everything	--	on	the	ice	and	then	fill	it	up	with	helium	.
And	that	process	takes	about	two	hours	.
And	the	weather	can	change	as	they	're	putting	together	this	whole	assembly	.
For	instance	,	here	they	are	laying	down	the	balloon	fabric	behind	,	which	is	eventually	going	to	be	filled	up	with	helium	.
Those	two	trucks	you	see	at	the	very	end	carry	12	tanks	each	of	compressed	helium	.
Now	,	in	case	the	weather	changes	before	the	launch	,	they	have	to	actually	pack	everything	back	up	into	their	boxes	and	take	it	out	back	to	McMurdo	Station	.
And	this	particular	balloon	,	because	it	has	to	launch	two	tons	of	weight	,	is	an	extremely	huge	balloon	.
The	fabric	alone	weighs	two	tons	.
In	order	to	minimize	the	weight	,	it	's	very	thin	,	it	's	as	thin	as	a	sandwich	wrapper	.
And	if	they	have	to	pack	it	back	,	they	have	to	put	it	into	boxes	and	stamp	on	it	so	that	it	fits	into	the	box	again	--	except	,	when	they	did	it	first	,	it	would	have	been	done	in	Texas	.
Here	,	they	ca	n't	do	it	with	the	kind	shoes	they	're	wearing	,	so	they	have	to	take	their	shoes	off	,	get	barefoot	into	the	boxes	,	in	this	cold	,	and	do	that	kind	of	work	.
That	's	the	kind	of	dedication	these	people	have	.
Here	's	the	balloon	being	filled	up	with	helium	,	and	you	can	see	it	's	a	gorgeous	sight	.
Here	's	a	scene	that	shows	you	the	balloon	and	the	payload	end-to-end	.
So	the	balloon	is	being	filled	up	with	helium	on	the	left-hand	side	,	and	the	fabric	actually	runs	all	the	way	to	the	middle	where	there	's	a	piece	of	electronics	and	explosives	being	connected	to	a	parachute	,	and	then	the	parachute	is	then	connected	to	the	payload	.
And	remember	,	all	this	wiring	is	being	done	by	people	in	extreme	cold	,	in	sub-zero	temperatures	.
They	're	wearing	about	15	kg	of	clothing	and	stuff	,	but	they	have	to	take	their	gloves	off	in	order	to	do	that	.
And	I	would	like	to	share	with	you	a	launch	.
Radio	:	Okay	,	release	the	balloon	,	release	the	balloon	,	release	the	balloon	.
Anil	Ananthaswamy	:	And	I	'll	finally	like	to	leave	you	with	two	images	.
This	is	an	observatory	in	the	Himalayas	,	in	Ladakh	in	India	.
And	the	thing	I	want	you	to	look	at	here	is	the	telescope	on	the	right-hand	side	.
And	on	the	far	left	there	is	a	400	year-old	Buddhist	monastery	.
This	is	a	close-up	of	the	Buddhist	monastery	.
And	I	was	struck	by	the	juxtaposition	of	these	two	enormous	disciplines	that	humanity	has	.
One	is	exploring	the	cosmos	on	the	outside	,	and	the	other	one	is	exploring	our	interior	being	.
And	both	require	silence	of	some	sort	.
And	what	struck	me	was	every	place	that	I	went	to	to	see	these	telescopes	,	the	astronomers	and	cosmologists	are	in	search	of	a	certain	kind	of	silence	,	whether	it	's	silence	from	radio	pollution	or	light	pollution	or	whatever	.
And	it	was	very	obvious	that	,	if	we	destroy	these	silent	places	on	Earth	,	we	will	be	stuck	on	a	planet	without	the	ability	to	look	outwards	,	because	we	will	not	be	able	to	understand	the	signals	that	come	from	outer	space	.
Thank	you	.
We	really	need	to	put	the	best	we	have	to	offer	within	reach	of	our	children	.
If	we	do	n't	do	that	,	we	're	going	to	get	the	generation	we	deserve	.
They	're	going	to	learn	from	whatever	it	is	they	have	around	them	.
And	we	,	as	now	the	elite	,	parents	,	librarians	,	professionals	,	whatever	it	is	,	a	bunch	of	our	activities	are	,	in	fact	,	in	trying	to	get	the	best	we	have	to	offer	within	reach	of	those	around	us	,	or	as	broadly	as	we	can	.
I	'm	going	to	start	and	end	this	talk	with	a	couple	things	that	are	carved	in	stone	.
One	is	what	's	on	the	Boston	Public	Library	.
Carved	above	their	door	is	,	``	Free	to	All	.	''	It	's	kind	of	an	inspiring	statement	,	and	I	'll	go	back	at	the	end	of	this	.
I	'm	a	librarian	,	and	what	I	'm	trying	to	do	is	bring	all	of	the	works	of	knowledge	to	as	many	people	as	want	to	read	it	.
And	the	idea	of	using	technology	is	perfect	for	us	.
I	think	we	have	the	opportunity	to	one-up	the	Greeks	.
It	's	not	easy	to	one-up	the	Greeks	.	But	with	the	industriousness	of	the	Egyptians	,	they	were	able	to	build	the	Library	of	Alexandria	--	the	idea	of	a	copy	of	every	book	of	all	the	peoples	of	the	world	.
The	problem	was	you	actually	had	to	go	to	Alexandria	to	go	to	it	.
On	the	other	hand	,	if	you	did	,	then	great	things	happened	.
I	think	we	can	one-up	the	Greeks	and	achieve	something	.
And	I	'm	going	to	try	to	argue	only	one	point	today	:	that	universal	access	to	all	knowledge	is	within	our	grasp	.
So	if	I	'm	successful	,	then	you	'll	actually	come	away	thinking	,	yeah	,	we	could	actually	achieve	the	great	vision	of	everything	ever	published	,	everything	that	was	ever	meant	for	distribution	,	available	to	anybody	in	the	world	that	's	ever	wanted	to	have	access	to	it	.
Yes	,	there	's	issues	about	how	money	should	be	distributed	,	and	that	's	still	being	refigured	out	.
But	I	'd	say	there	's	plenty	of	money	,	and	there	's	plenty	of	demand	,	so	we	can	actually	achieve	that	.
But	I	'm	going	to	go	over	the	technological	,	social	and	sort	of	where	are	we	as	a	whole	,	trying	to	get	to	that	particular	vision	.
And	the	way	I	'm	going	to	try	to	do	this	is	do	it	like	the	Amazon.com	website	,	the	books	,	music	,	video	and	just	go	step	--	media	type	by	media	type	,	just	go	and	say	,	all	right	,	how	're	we	doing	on	this	?
So	if	we	start	with	books	,	you	know	,	sort	of	where	are	we	?
Well	,	first	you	have	to	,	as	an	engineer	,	scope	the	problem	.	How	big	is	it	?
If	you	wanted	to	put	all	of	the	published	works	online	so	that	anybody	could	have	it	available	,	well	,	how	big	a	problem	is	it	?
Well	,	we	do	n't	really	know	,	but	the	largest	print	library	in	the	world	is	the	Library	of	Congress	.	It	's	26	million	volumes	,	26	million	volumes	.
It	is	,	by	far	and	away	,	the	largest	print	library	in	the	world	.
And	a	book	,	if	you	had	a	book	,	is	about	a	megabyte	,	so	--	you	know	,	if	you	had	it	in	Microsoft	Word	.
So	a	megabyte	,	26	million	megabytes	is	26	terabytes	--	it	goes	mega-	,	giga-	,	tera-	.	26	terabytes	.
26	terabytes	fits	in	a	computer	system	that	's	about	this	big	,	on	spinning	Linux	drives	,	and	it	costs	about	60,000	dollars	.
So	for	the	cost	of	a	house	--	or	around	here	,	a	garage	--	you	can	put	,	you	can	have	spinning	all	of	the	words	in	the	Library	of	Congress	.
That	's	pretty	neat	.
Then	the	question	is	,	what	do	you	get	?
You	know	,	is	it	worth	trying	to	get	there	?
Do	you	actually	want	it	online	?
Some	of	the	first	things	that	people	do	is	they	make	book	readers	that	allow	you	to	search	inside	the	books	,	and	that	's	kind	of	fun	.
And	you	can	download	these	things	,	and	look	around	them	in	new	and	different	ways	.
And	you	can	get	at	them	remotely	,	if	you	happen	to	have	a	laptop	.
There	's	starting	to	be	some	of	these	sort	of	page	turn-y	interfaces	that	look	a	whole	lot	like	books	in	certain	ways	,	and	you	can	search	them	,	make	little	tabs	,	and	it	's	kind	of	cute	--	still	very	book-like	--	on	your	laptop	.
But	I	do	n't	know	,	reading	things	on	a	laptop	--	whenever	I	pull	up	my	laptop	,	it	always	feels	like	work	.
I	think	that	's	one	of	the	reasons	why	the	Kindle	is	so	great	.
I	do	n't	have	to	feel	like	I	'm	at	work	to	read	a	Kindle	.	It	's	starting	to	be	a	little	bit	more	specified	.
But	I	have	to	say	that	there	's	older	technologies	that	I	tend	to	like	.
I	like	the	physical	book	.
And	I	think	we	can	go	and	use	our	technology	to	go	and	digitize	things	,	put	them	on	the	Net	,	and	then	download	,	print	them	and	bind	them	,	and	end	up	with	books	again	.
And	we	sort	of	said	,	well	,	how	hard	is	this	?
And	it	turns	out	to	not	be	very	hard	.
We	actually	went	off	to	make	a	bookmobile	.
And	a	bookmobile	--	the	size	of	a	van	with	a	satellite	dish	,	a	printer	,	binder	and	cutter	,	and	kids	make	their	own	books	.
It	costs	about	three	dollars	to	download	,	print	and	bind	a	normal	,	old	book	.
And	they	actually	come	out	kind	of	nice	looking	.
You	can	actually	get	really	good-looking	books	for	on	the	order	of	one	penny	per	page	,	sort	of	the	parts	cost	for	doing	this	.
So	the	idea	of	--	this	technology	actually	may	end	up	putting	books	back	in	people	's	hands	again	.
There	are	some	other	bookmobiles	running	around	.
This	is	Eric	Eldred	making	books	at	Walden	Pond	--	Thoreau	's	works	.
This	is	just	before	he	got	kicked	out	by	the	Parks	Services	,	for	competing	with	the	bookstore	there	.
In	India	,	they	've	got	another	couple	bookmobiles	running	around	.
And	this	is	the	opening	day	at	the	Library	of	Alexandria	,	the	new	Library	of	Alexandria	,	in	Egypt	.
It	was	quite	popularly	attended	.
And	kids	starting	to	make	their	own	books	,
and	a	happy	kid	with	the	first	book	that	he	's	ever	owned	.
So	the	idea	of	being	able	to	use	this	technology	to	end	up	with	paper	where	I	can	handle	sort	of	sounds	a	little	retro	,	but	I	think	it	still	has	its	place	.
And	being	from	the	Silicon	Valley	,	sort	of	utopian	sort	of	world	,	we	thought	,	if	we	can	make	this	technology	work	in	rural	Uganda	,	we	might	have	something	.
So	we	actually	got	some	funding	from	the	World	Bank	to	try	it	out	.
And	we	found	in	about	30	days	we	could	go	and	take	a	couple	folks	from	Silicon	Valley	,	fly	them	to	Uganda	,	buy	a	car	,	set	up	the	first	Internet	connection	at	the	National	Library	of	Uganda	,	figure	out	what	they	wanted	,	and	get	a	program	going	making	books	in	rural	Uganda	.
And	it	actually	--	so	technologically	,	it	works	.
What	we	found	out	of	this	is	we	did	n't	have	the	right	books	.
So	the	books	were	in	the	library	.	We	could	get	it	to	people	,	if	they	're	digitized	,	but	we	did	n't	know	how	to	quite	get	them	digitized	.
Everybody	thought	the	answer	is	,	send	things	to	India	and	China	.
And	so	we	've	tried	that	,	and	I	'll	go	over	that	in	a	moment	.
There	are	some	newer	technologies	for	delivering	that	have	happened	that	are	actually	quite	exciting	as	well	.
One	is	a	print-on-demand	machine	that	looks	like	a	Rube	Goldberg	machine	.
We	have	one	of	these	things	now	.	It	's	completely	cool	.
It	's	all	conveyor	belt	,	and	it	makes	a	book	.
And	it	's	called	the	``	Espresso	Book	Machine	,	''	and	in	about	10	minutes	,	you	can	press	a	button	and	make	a	book	.
Something	else	I	'm	quite	excited	about	in	this	particular	domain	,	beyond	these	sort	of	kiosk-y	things	where	you	can	get	books	on	demand	,	is	some	of	these	new	little	screens	that	are	coming	out	.
And	one	of	my	favorites	in	this	is	the	$	100	laptop	.
And	I	do	n't	mean	to	steal	any	thunder	here	,	but	we	've	gone	and	used	one	of	these	things	to	be	an	e-book	reader	.
So	here	's	one	of	the	beta	units	and	you	can	--	it	actually	turns	out	to	be	a	really	good-looking	e-book	reader	.
And	we	have	a	quick	hack	that	we	did	to	try	to	put	one	of	our	books	on	it	,	and	it	turns	out	that	200	dots	per	inch	means	that	you	can	put	scanned	books	on	them	that	look	really	good	.
At	200	dots	per	inch	,	it	's	kind	of	the	equivalent	of	a	300	dot	print	laser	printer	.
We	're	in	good	enough	shape	.
You	actually	can	go	and	read	scanned	books	quite	easily	.
So	the	idea	of	electronic	books	is	starting	to	come	about	.
But	how	do	you	go	about	doing	all	this	scanning	?
So	we	thought	,	okay	,	well	,	let	's	try	out	this	send	books	to	India	thing	.
And	there	was	a	project	with	,	funded	by	the	National	Science	Foundation	--	sent	a	bunch	of	scanners	,	and	the	American	libraries	were	supposed	to	send	books	.
Well	,	they	did	n't	.	They	did	n't	want	to	send	their	books	.
So	we	bought	100,000	books	and	sent	them	to	India	.
And	then	we	learned	why	you	do	n't	want	to	send	books	to	India	.
The	lesson	we	learned	out	of	this	is	,	scan	your	own	books	.
If	you	really	care	about	books	,	you	're	going	to	scan	them	better	,	especially	if	they	're	valuable	books	.
If	they	're	new	books	and	you	can	just	,	you	know	,	butcher	them	,	because	you	could	just	buy	another	one	,	that	's	not	such	a	big	deal	in	terms	of	doing	high-quality	scanning	.
But	do	things	that	you	love	.
But	the	Indians	have	been	scanning	a	lot	of	their	own	books	--	about	300,000	now	--	doing	very	well	.
The	Chinese	did	over	a	million	,	and	the	Egyptians	are	about	30,000	.
But	we	sent	--	thought	,	OK	,	if	we	're	going	to	need	to	do	this	,	let	's	do	it	in-library	.
How	do	we	go	and	do	this	,	and	how	do	we	get	it	down	so	that	it	's	a	cost	point	that	we	could	afford	?
And	we	sort	of	picked	the	price	point	of	10	cents	a	page	.
If	it	's	basically	the	cost	of	xeroxing	to	basically	digitize	,	OCR	,	package	it	up	,	make	it	so	that	you	could	download	,	print	and	bind	it	--	the	whole	shebang	--	we	would	have	achieved	something	.
So	we	started	out	trying	to	figure	out	.	How	do	we	get	to	10	cents	?
And	we	tried	these	robot	things	,	and	they	worked	pretty	well	--	sort	of	these	auto-page-turning	things	.
If	we	can	have	Mars	Rovers	,	you	'd	think	you	could	turn	pages	.
But	it	actually	turns	out	to	be	pretty	hard	to	turn	pages	,	and	the	volume	is	n't	there	.
So	anyway	--	so	we	ended	up	making	our	own	book	scanner	,
and	with	two	digital	,	high-grade	,	professional	digital	cameras	,	controlled	museum	lighting	,	so	even	if	it	's	a	black	and	white	book	,	you	can	go	and	get	the	proper	intonation	.
So	you	basically	do	a	beautiful	,	respectful	job	.
This	is	not	a	fax	,	this	is	--	the	idea	is	to	do	a	beautiful	job	as	you	're	going	through	these	libraries	.
And	we	've	been	able	to	achieve	10	cents	a	page	if	we	run	things	in	volume	.
This	is	what	it	looks	like	at	the	University	of	Toronto	.
And	actually	,	it	turns	out	to	,	you	know	,	pay	a	living	wage	.
People	seem	to	love	it	.
Yes	,	it	's	a	little	boring	,	but	some	people	kind	of	get	into	the	Zen	of	it	.
And	especially	if	it	's	kind	of	interesting	books	that	you	care	about	,	in	languages	that	you	can	read	.	We	actually	have	been	able	to	do	a	pretty	good	job	of	this	,	at	getting	10	cents	a	page	.
So	10	cents	a	page	,	300	pages	in	your	average	book	,	30	dollars	a	book	.
The	Library	of	Congress	,	if	you	did	the	whole	darn	thing	--	26	million	books	--	is	about	750	million	dollars	,	right	?
But	a	million	books	,	I	think	,	actually	would	be	a	pretty	good	start	,	and	that	would	cost	30	million	dollars	.	That	's	not	that	big	a	bill	.
And	what	we	've	been	able	to	do	is	get	into	libraries	.
We	've	now	got	eight	of	these	scanning	centers	in	three	countries	,	and	libraries	are	up	for	having	their	books	scanned	.	The	Getty	here	is	moving	their	books	to	the	UCLA	,	which	is	where	we	have	one	these	scanning	centers	,	and	scanning	their	out-of-copyright	books	,	which	is	fabulous	.
So	we	're	starting	to	get	the	institutional	responsibility	.
The	thing	we	're	missing	is	the	10	cents	.
If	we	can	get	the	10	cents	,	all	the	rest	of	it	flows	.
We	've	scanned	about	200,000	books	.
Now	we	're	scanning	about	15,000	books	a	month	,
and	it	's	starting	to	gear	up	another	factor	of	two	from	there	.
So	all	in	all	,	that	's	going	very	well	.
And	we	're	starting	to	move	out	of	the	just	out-of-copyright	into	the	out-of-print	world	.
So	I	think	of	--	we	're	kind	of	going	from	the	out-of-copyright	,	library	stuff	,	and	Amazon.com	is	coming	from	the	in-print	world	.	And	I	think	we	'll	meet	in	the	middle	some	place	,	and	have	the	classic	thing	that	you	have	,	which	is	a	publishing	system	and	a	library	system	working	in	parallel	.
And	so	we	're	starting	up	a	program	to	do	out-of-print	works	,	but	loaning	them	.
Exactly	what	loaning	means	,	I	'm	not	quite	sure	.
But	anyway	,	loaning	out-of-print	works	from	the	Boston	Public	Library	,	the	Woods	Hole	Oceanographic	Institute	and	a	few	other	libraries	that	are	starting	to	participate	in	this	program	,	to	try	out	this	model	of	where	does	a	library	stop	and	where	does	the	bookstore	take	over	.
So	all	in	all	,	it	's	possible	to	do	this	in	large	scale	.
We	're	also	going	back	over	microfilm	and	getting	that	online	.
So	,	we	can	do	10	cents	a	page	,	we	're	going	15,000	books	a	month	and	we	've	got	about	250,000	books	online	,	counting	all	the	other	projects	that	are	starting	to	add	in	.
So	what	I	wanted	to	argue	is	,	books	are	within	our	grasp	.
The	idea	of	taking	on	the	whole	ball	of	wax	is	not	that	big	a	deal	.
Yes	,	it	costs	tens	of	millions	,	low	hundreds	of	millions	,	but	one	time	shot	and	we	've	got	basically	the	history	of	printed	literature	online	.
And	then	,	there	's	business	model	issues	about	how	to	try	to	effectively	market	it	and	get	it	to	people	.
But	it	is	within	our	grasp	,	technologically	and	law-wise	,	at	least	for	the	out	of	print	and	out	of	copyright	,	we	suggest	,	to	be	able	to	get	the	whole	darn	thing	online	.
Now	let	's	go	for	audio	,	and	I	'm	going	to	go	through	these	.
So	how	much	is	there	?
Well	,	as	best	we	can	tell	,	there	are	about	two	to	three	million	disks	having	been	published	--	so	78s	,	long-playing	records	and	CDs	--	or	at	least	that	's	the	largest	archives	of	published	materials	we	've	been	able	to	sort	of	point	at	.
It	costs	about	10	dollars	a	piece	to	go	and	take	a	disk	and	put	it	online	,	if	you	're	doing	things	in	volume	.
But	we	've	found	that	the	rights	issues	are	really	quite	thorny	.
This	is	a	fairly	heavily	litigated	area	,	so	we	've	found	that	there	are	niches	in	the	music	world	that	are	n't	served	terribly	well	by	the	classic	commercial	publishing	system	.
And	we	've	been	starting	to	make	these	available	by	going	and	offering	shelf	space	on	the	Net	.
In	the	United	States	,	it	does	n't	cost	you	to	give	something	away	.	Right	?
If	you	give	something	to	a	charity	or	to	the	public	,	you	get	a	pat	on	the	back	and	a	tax	donation	--	except	on	the	Net	,	where	you	can	go	broke	.
If	you	put	up	a	video	of	your	garage	band	,	and	it	starts	getting	heavily	accessed	,	you	can	lose	your	guitars	or	your	house	.
This	does	n't	make	any	sense	.
So	we	've	offered	unlimited	storage	,	unlimited	bandwidth	,	forever	,	for	free	,	to	anybody	that	has	something	to	share	that	belongs	in	a	library	.
And	we	've	been	getting	a	lot	of	takers	.	One	is	the	rock	'n	'	rollers	.
The	rock	'n	'	rollers	had	a	tradition	of	sharing	,	as	long	as	nobody	made	any	money	.	You	could	--	concert	recordings	,	it	's	not	the	commercial	recordings	,	but	concert	recordings	,	started	by	the	Grateful	Dead	.
And	we	get	about	two	or	three	bands	a	day	signing	up	.
They	give	permission	,	and	we	get	about	40	or	50	concerts	a	day	.
We	have	about	40,000	concerts	,	everything	the	Grateful	Dead	ever	did	,	up	on	the	Net	,	so	that	people	can	see	it	and	listen	to	this	material	.
So	audio	is	possible	to	put	up	,	but	the	rights	issues	are	really	pretty	thorny	.
We	've	got	a	lot	of	collections	now	--	a	couple	hundred	thousand	items	--	and	it	's	growing	over	time	.
Moving	images	:	if	you	think	of	theatrical	releases	,	there	are	not	that	many	of	them	.
As	best	we	can	tell	,	there	are	about	150,000	to	200,000	movies	ever	that	are	really	meant	for	a	large-scale	theatrical	distribution	.	It	's	just	not	that	many	.
But	half	of	those	were	Indian	.
But	anyway	,	it	's	doable	,	but	we	've	only	found	about	a	thousand	of	these	things	that	--	to	be	out	of	copyright	.
So	we	've	digitized	those	and	made	those	available	.
But	we	've	found	that	there	's	lots	of	other	types	of	movies	that	have	n't	really	seen	the	light	of	day	--	archival	films	.
We	've	found	,	also	,	a	lot	of	political	films	,	a	lot	of	amateur	films	,	all	sorts	of	things	that	are	basically	needing	a	home	,	a	permanent	home	.
So	we	've	been	starting	to	make	these	available	and	it	's	grown	to	be	very	popular	.
We	're	not	quite	a	YouTube	.	We	tended	towards	longer-term	things	and	also	things	that	people	can	reuse	and	make	into	new	movies	,	which	has	just	been	great	fun	.
Television	comes	quite	a	bit	larger	.
We	started	recording	20	channels	of	television	24	hours	a	day	.
It	's	sort	of	the	biggest	TiVo	box	you	've	ever	seen	.
It	's	about	a	petabyte	,	so	far	,	of	worldwide	television	--	Russian	,	Chinese	,	Japanese	,	Iraqi	,	Al	Jazeera	,	BBC	,	CNN	,	ABC	,	CBS	,	NBC	--	24	hours	a	day	.
We	only	put	one	week	up	,	which	is	mostly	for	cost	reasons	,	which	is	the	9/11	,	sort	of	from	9/11/2001	.	For	one	week	,	what	did	the	world	see	?
CNN	was	saying	that	Palestinians	were	dancing	in	the	streets	.
Were	they	?	Let	's	look	at	the	Palestinian	television	and	find	out	.
How	can	we	have	critical	thinking	without	being	able	to	quote
and	being	able	to	compare	what	happened	in	the	past	?
And	television	is	dreadfully	unrecorded	and	unquotable	,	except	by	Jon	Stewart	,	who	does	a	fabulous	job	.
So	anyway	,	television	is	,	I	would	suggest	,	within	our	grasp	.
So	15	dollars	per	video	hour	,	and	also	about	100	dollars	to	150	dollars	per	celluloid	hour	,	we	're	able	to	go	and	get	materials	online	very	inexpensively	and	have	them	up	on	the	Net	.
And	we	've	got	,	now	,	a	lot	of	these	materials	.
So	we	've	got	about	100,000	pieces	up	there	.
So	books	,	music	,	video	,	software	.	There	's	only	50,000	titles	of	it	.
Mostly	the	issues	there	are	legal	issues	and	breaking	copy	protections	.
But	we	've	worked	through	some	of	those	,	but	we	've	still	got	real	problems	in	Washington	.
Well	,	we	're	best	known	as	the	World	Wide	Web	.
We	've	been	archiving	the	World	Wide	Web	since	1996	.
We	take	a	snapshot	of	every	website	and	all	of	the	pages	on	it	,	every	two	months	.
And	actually	,	it	's	really	been	pioneered	by	Alexa	Internet	,	which	donates	this	collection	to	the	Internet	Archive	.
And	it	's	been	growing	along	for	the	last	11	years	,	and	it	's	a	fantastic	resource	.
And	we	've	made	a	Wayback	Machine	that	you	can	then	go	and	see	old	websites	kind	of	the	way	they	were	.
If	you	go	and	search	on	something	--	this	is	Google.com	,	the	different	versions	of	it	that	we	have	,	this	is	what	it	looks	like	when	it	was	an	alpha	release	,	and	this	is	what	it	looked	like	at	Stanford	.
So	anyway	,	you	've	got	basically	an	idea	of	where	things	came	from	.
Mostly	,	people	want	to	see	their	old	stuff	out	of	this	.
If	there	's	one	thing	that	we	want	to	learn	from	the	Library	of	Alexandria	version	one	,	which	is	probably	best	known	for	burning	,	is	,	do	n't	just	have	one	copy	.
So	we	've	started	to	--	we	've	made	another	copy	of	all	of	this	and	we	actually	put	it	back	in	the	Library	of	Alexandria	.
So	this	is	a	picture	of	the	Internet	Archive	at	the	Library	of	Alexandria	.
And	we	now	have	also	another	copy	building	up	in	Amsterdam	.
So	,	we	should	put	it	in	the	San	Andreas	Fault	Line	in	San	Francisco	,	flood	zone	in	Amsterdam	and	in	the	Middle	East	.	Right	,	so	anyway	...
so	we	're	hedging	our	bets	here	.
If	we	go	and	put	it	in	a	couple	more	places	,	I	think	we	'll	be	in	good	shape	.
There	's	a	political	and	social	question	out	of	this	.
Is	all	of	this	,	as	we	go	digital	,	is	it	going	to	be	public	or	private	?
There	's	some	large	companies	that	have	seen	this	vision	,	that	are	doing	large-scale	digitization	,	but	they	're	locking	up	the	public	domain	.
The	question	is	,	is	that	the	world	that	we	really	want	to	live	in	?
What	's	the	role	of	the	public	versus	the	private	as	things	go	forward	?
How	do	we	go	and	have	a	world	where	we	both	have	libraries	and	publishing	in	the	future	,	just	as	we	basically	benefited	as	we	were	growing	up	?
So	universal	access	to	all	knowledge	--	I	think	it	can	be	one	of	the	greatest	achievements	of	humankind	,	like	the	man	on	the	moon	,	or	the	Gutenberg	Bible	,	or	the	Library	of	Alexandria	.
It	could	be	something	that	we	're	remembered	for	,	for	millennia	,	for	having	achieved	.
And	as	I	said	before	,	I	'll	end	with	something	that	's	carved	above	the	door	of	the	Carnegie	Library	.	Carnegie	--	one	of	the	great	capitalists	of	this	country	--	carved	above	his	legacy	,	``	Free	to	the	People	.	''
Thank	you	very	much	.
Imagine	,	if	you	will	--	a	gift	.
I	'd	like	for	you	to	picture	it	in	your	mind	.
It	's	not	too	big	--	about	the	size	of	a	golf	ball	.
So	envision	what	it	looks	like	all	wrapped	up	.
But	before	I	show	you	what	's	inside	,	I	will	tell	you	,	it	's	going	to	do	incredible	things	for	you	.
It	will	bring	all	of	your	family	together	.
You	will	feel	loved	and	appreciated	like	never	before	and	reconnect	with	friends	and	acquaintances	you	have	n't	heard	from	in	years	.
Adoration	and	admiration	will	overwhelm	you	.
It	will	recalibrate	what	's	most	important	in	your	life	.
It	will	redefine	your	sense	of	spirituality	and	faith	.
You	'll	have	a	new	understanding	and	trust	in	your	body	.
You	'll	have	unsurpassed	vitality	and	energy	.
You	'll	expand	your	vocabulary	,	meet	new	people	,	and	you	'll	have	a	healthier	lifestyle	.
And	get	this	--	you	'll	have	an	eight-week	vacation	of	doing	absolutely	nothing	.
You	'll	eat	countless	gourmet	meals	.
Flowers	will	arrive	by	the	truckload	.
People	will	say	to	you	,	``	You	look	great	.	Have	you	had	any	work	done	?	''
And	you	'll	have	a	lifetime	supply	of	good	drugs	.
You	'll	be	challenged	,	inspired	,	motivated	and	humbled	.
Your	life	will	have	new	meaning	.
Peace	,	health	,	serenity	,	happiness	,	nirvana	.
The	price	?
$	55,000	,
and	that	's	an	incredible	deal	.
By	now	I	know	you	're	dying	to	know	what	it	is	and	where	you	can	get	one	.
Does	Amazon	carry	it	?
Does	it	have	the	Apple	logo	on	it	?
Is	there	a	waiting	list	?
Not	likely	.
This	gift	came	to	me	about	five	months	ago	.
It	looked	more	like	this	when	it	was	all	wrapped	up	--	not	quite	so	pretty	.
And	this	,
and	then	this	.
It	was	a	rare	gem	--	a	brain	tumor	,	hemangioblastoma	--	the	gift	that	keeps	on	giving	.
And	while	I	'm	okay	now	,	I	would	n't	wish	this	gift	for	you	.
I	'm	not	sure	you	'd	want	it	.
But	I	would	n't	change	my	experience	.
It	profoundly	altered	my	life	in	ways	I	did	n't	expect	in	all	the	ways	I	just	shared	with	you	.
So	the	next	time	you	're	faced	with	something	that	's	unexpected	,	unwanted	and	uncertain	,	consider	that	it	just	may	be	a	gift	.
I	love	a	challenge	,	and	saving	the	Earth	is	probably	a	good	one	.
We	all	know	the	Earth	is	in	trouble	.
We	have	now	entered	in	the	6X	,	the	sixth	major	extinction	on	this	planet	.
I	often	wondered	,	if	there	was	a	United	Organization	of	Organisms	--	otherwise	known	as	``	Uh-Oh	''	--	--	and	every	organism	had	a	right	to	vote	,	would	we	be	voted	on	the	planet	,	or	off	the	planet	?
I	think	that	vote	is	occurring	right	now	.
I	want	to	present	to	you	a	suite	of	six	mycological	solutions	,	using	fungi	,	and	these	solutions	are	based	on	mycelium	.
The	mycelium	infuses	all	landscapes	,	it	holds	soils	together	,	it	's	extremely	tenacious	.
This	holds	up	to	30,000	times	its	mass	.
They	're	the	grand	molecular	disassemblers	of	nature	--	the	soil	magicians	.
They	generate	the	humus	soils	across	the	landmasses	of	Earth	.
We	have	now	discovered	that	there	is	a	multi-directional	transfer	of	nutrients	between	plants	,	mitigated	by	the	mcyelium	--	so	the	mycelium	is	the	mother	that	is	giving	nutrients	from	alder	and	birch	trees	to	hemlocks	,	cedars	and	Douglas	firs	.
Dusty	and	I	,	we	like	to	say	,	on	Sunday	,	this	is	where	we	go	to	church	.
I	'm	in	love	with	the	old-growth	forest	,	and	I	'm	a	patriotic	American	because	we	have	those	.
Most	of	you	are	familiar	with	Portobello	mushrooms	.
And	frankly	,	I	face	a	big	obstacle	.	When	I	mention	mushrooms	to	somebody	,	they	immediately	think	Portobellos	or	magic	mushrooms	,	their	eyes	glaze	over	,	and	they	think	I	'm	a	little	crazy	.
So	,	I	hope	to	pierce	that	prejudice	forever	with	this	group	.
We	call	it	mycophobia	,	the	irrational	fear	of	the	unknown	,	when	it	comes	to	fungi	.
Mushrooms	are	very	fast	in	their	growth	.
Day	21	,	day	23	,	day	25	.
Mushrooms	produce	strong	antibiotics	.
In	fact	,	we	're	more	closely	related	to	fungi	than	we	are	to	any	other	kingdom	.
A	group	of	20	eukaryotic	microbiologists	published	a	paper	two	years	ago	erecting	opisthokonta	--	a	super-kingdom	that	joins	animalia	and	fungi	together	.
We	share	in	common	the	same	pathogens	.
Fungi	do	n't	like	to	rot	from	bacteria	,	and	so	our	best	antibiotics	come	from	fungi	.
But	here	is	a	mushroom	that	's	past	its	prime	.
After	they	sporulate	,	they	do	rot	.
But	I	propose	to	you	that	the	sequence	of	microbes	that	occur	on	rotting	mushrooms	are	essential	for	the	health	of	the	forest	.
They	give	rise	to	the	trees	,	they	create	the	debris	fields	that	feed	the	mycelium	.
And	so	we	see	a	mushroom	here	sporulating	.
And	the	spores	are	germinating	,	and	the	mycelium	forms	and	goes	underground	.
In	a	single	cubic	inch	of	soil	,	there	can	be	more	than	eight	miles	of	these	cells	.
My	foot	is	covering	approximately	300	miles	of	mycelium	.
This	is	photomicrographs	from	Nick	Read	and	Patrick	Hickey	.
And	notice	that	as	the	mycelium	grows	,	it	conquers	territory	and	then	it	begins	the	net	.
I	've	been	a	scanning	electron	microscopist	for	many	years	,	I	have	thousands	of	electron	micrographs	,	and	when	I	'm	staring	at	the	mycelium	,	I	realize	that	they	are	microfiltration	membranes	.
We	exhale	carbon	dioxide	,	so	does	mycelium	.
It	inhales	oxygen	,	just	like	we	do	.
But	these	are	essentially	externalized	stomachs	and	lungs	.
And	I	present	to	you	a	concept	that	these	are	extended	neurological	membranes	.
And	in	these	cavities	,	these	micro-cavities	form	,	and	as	they	fuse	soils	,	they	absorb	water	.
These	are	little	wells	.
And	inside	these	wells	,	then	microbial	communities	begin	to	form	.
And	so	the	spongy	soil	not	only	resists	erosion	,	but	sets	up	a	microbial	universe	that	gives	rise	to	a	plurality	of	other	organisms	.
I	first	proposed	,	in	the	early	1990s	,	that	mycelium	is	Earth	's	natural	Internet	.
When	you	look	at	the	mycelium	,	they	're	highly	branched	.
And	if	there	's	one	branch	that	is	broken	,	then	very	quickly	,	because	of	the	nodes	of	crossing	--	Internet	engineers	maybe	call	them	hot	points	--	there	are	alternative	pathways	for	channeling	nutrients	and	information	.
The	mycelium	is	sentient	.
It	knows	that	you	are	there	.
When	you	walk	across	landscapes	,	it	leaps	up	in	the	aftermath	of	your	footsteps	trying	to	grab	debris	.
So	,	I	believe	the	invention	of	the	computer	Internet	is	an	inevitable	consequence	of	a	previously	proven	,	biologically	successful	model	.
The	Earth	invented	the	computer	Internet	for	its	own	benefit	,	and	we	now	,	being	the	top	organism	on	this	planet	,	are	trying	to	allocate	resources	in	order	to	protect	the	biosphere	.
Going	way	out	,	dark	matter	conforms	to	the	same	mycelial	archetype	.
I	believe	matter	begets	life	;	life	becomes	single	cells	;	single	cells	become	strings	;	strings	become	chains	;	chains	network	.
And	this	is	the	paradigm	that	we	see	throughout	the	universe	.
Most	of	you	may	not	know	that	fungi	were	the	first	organisms	to	come	to	land	.
They	came	to	land	1.3	billion	years	ago	,	and	plants	followed	several	hundred	million	years	later	.
How	is	that	possible	?
It	's	possible	because	the	mycelium	produces	oxalic	acids	,	and	many	other	acids	and	enzymes	,	pockmarking	rock	and	grabbing	calcium	and	other	minerals	and	forming	calcium	oxalates	.
Makes	the	rocks	crumble	,	and	the	first	step	in	the	generation	of	soil	.
Oxalic	acid	is	two	carbon	dioxide	molecules	joined	together	.
So	,	fungi	and	mycelium	sequester	carbon	dioxide	in	the	form	of	calcium	oxalates	.
And	all	sorts	of	other	oxalates	are	also	sequestering	carbon	dioxide	through	the	minerals	that	are	being	formed	and	taken	out	of	the	rock	matrix	.
This	was	first	discovered	in	1859	.
This	is	a	photograph	by	Franz	Hueber	.
This	photograph	's	taken	1950s	in	Saudi	Arabia	.
420	million	years	ago	,	this	organism	existed	.
It	was	called	Prototaxites	.
Prototaxites	,	laying	down	,	was	about	three	feet	tall	.
The	tallest	plants	on	Earth	at	that	time	were	less	than	two	feet	.
Dr.	Boyce	,	at	the	University	of	Chicago	,	published	an	article	in	the	Journal	of	Geology	this	past	year	determining	that	Prototaxites	was	a	giant	fungus	,	a	giant	mushroom	.
Across	the	landscapes	of	Earth	were	dotted	these	giant	mushrooms	.
All	across	most	land	masses	.
And	these	existed	for	tens	of	millions	of	years	.
Now	,	we	've	had	several	extinction	events	,	and	as	we	march	forward	--	65	million	years	ago	--	most	of	you	know	about	it	--	we	had	an	asteroid	impact	.
The	Earth	was	struck	by	an	asteroid	,	a	huge	amount	of	debris	was	jettisoned	into	the	atmosphere	.
Sunlight	was	cut	off	,	and	fungi	inherited	the	Earth	.
Those	organisms	that	paired	with	fungi	were	rewarded	,	because	fungi	do	not	need	light	.
More	recently	,	at	Einstein	University	,	they	just	determined	that	fungi	use	radiation	as	a	source	of	energy	,	much	like	plants	use	light	.
So	,	the	prospect	of	fungi	existing	on	other	planets	elsewhere	,	I	think	,	is	a	forgone	conclusion	,	at	least	in	my	own	mind	.
The	largest	organism	in	the	world	is	in	Eastern	Oregon	.
I	could	n't	miss	it	.	It	was	2,200	acres	in	size	:
2,200	acres	in	size	,	2,000	years	old	.
The	largest	organism	on	the	planet	is	a	mycelial	mat	,	one	cell	wall	thick	.
How	is	it	that	this	organism	can	be	so	large	,	and	yet	be	one	cell	wall	thick	,	whereas	we	have	five	or	six	skin	layers	that	protect	us	?
The	mycelium	,	in	the	right	conditions	,	produces	a	mushroom	--	it	bursts	through	with	such	ferocity	that	it	can	break	asphalt	.
We	were	involved	with	several	experiments	.
I	'm	going	to	show	you	six	,	if	I	can	,	solutions	for	helping	to	save	the	world	.
Battelle	Laboratories	and	I	joined	up	in	Bellingham	,	Washington	.
There	were	four	piles	saturated	with	diesel	and	other	petroleum	waste	:
one	was	a	control	pile	;	one	pile	was	treated	with	enzymes	;	one	pile	was	treated	with	bacteria	;	and	our	pile	we	inoculated	with	mushroom	mycelium	.
The	mycelium	absorbs	the	oil	.
The	mycelium	is	producing	enzymes	--	peroxidases	--	that	break	carbon-hydrogen	bonds	.
These	are	the	same	bonds	that	hold	hydrocarbons	together	.
So	,	the	mycelium	becomes	saturated	with	the	oil	,	and	then	,	when	we	returned	six	weeks	later	,	all	the	tarps	were	removed	,	all	the	other	piles	were	dead	,	dark	and	stinky	.
We	came	back	to	our	pile	,	it	was	covered	with	hundreds	of	pounds	of	oyster	mushrooms	,	and	the	color	changed	to	a	light	form	.
The	enzymes	remanufactured	the	hydrocarbons	into	carbohydrates	--	fungal	sugars	.
Some	of	these	mushrooms	are	very	happy	mushrooms	.
They	're	very	large	.
They	're	showing	how	much	nutrition	that	they	could	've	obtained	.
But	something	else	happened	,	which	was	an	epiphany	in	my	life	.
They	sporulated	,	the	spores	attract	insects	,	the	insects	laid	eggs	,	eggs	became	larvae	.
Birds	then	came	,	bringing	in	seeds	,	and	our	pile	became	an	oasis	of	life	.
Whereas	the	other	three	piles	were	dead	,	dark	and	stinky	,	and	the	PAH	's	--	the	aromatic	hydrocarbons	--	went	from	10,000	parts	per	million	to	less	than	200	in	eight	weeks	.
The	last	image	we	do	n't	have	.	The	entire	pile	was	a	green	berm	of	life	.
These	are	gateway	species	,
vanguard	species	that	open	the	door	for	other	biological	communities	.
So	I	invented	burlap	sacks	,	bunker	spawn	--	and	putting	the	mycelium	--	using	storm	blown	debris	,	you	can	take	these	burlap	sacks	and	put	them	downstream	from	a	farm	that	's	producing	E.	coli	,	or	other	wastes	,	or	a	factory	with	chemical	toxins	,	and	it	leads	to	habitat	restoration	.
So	,	we	set	up	a	site	in	Mason	County	,	Washington	,	and	we	've	seen	a	dramatic	decrease	in	the	amount	of	coliforms	.
And	I	'll	show	you	a	graph	here	.
This	is	a	logarithmic	scale	,	10	to	the	eighth	power	.
There	's	more	than	a	100	million	colonies	per	gram	,	and	10	to	the	third	power	is	around	1,000	.
In	48	hours	to	72	hours	,	these	three	mushroom	species	reduced	the	amount	of	coliform	bacteria	10,000	times	.
Think	of	the	implications	.
This	is	a	space-conservative	method	that	uses	storm	debris	--	and	we	can	guarantee	that	we	will	have	storms	every	year	.
So	,	this	one	mushroom	,	in	particular	,	has	drawn	our	interest	over	time	.
This	is	my	wife	Dusty	,	with	a	mushroom	called	Fomitopsis	officinalis	--	Agarikon	.
It	's	a	mushroom	exclusive	to	the	old-growth	forest	that	Dioscorides	first	described	in	65	A.D	.
as	a	treatment	against	consumption	.
This	mushroom	grows	in	Washington	State	,	Oregon	,	northern	California	,	British	Columbia	,	now	thought	to	be	extinct	in	Europe	.
May	not	seem	that	large	--	let	's	get	closer	.
This	is	extremely	rare	fungus	.
Our	team	--	and	we	have	a	team	of	experts	that	go	out	--	we	went	out	20	times	in	the	old-growth	forest	last	year	.
We	found	one	sample	to	be	able	to	get	into	culture	.
Preserving	the	genome	of	these	fungi	in	the	old-growth	forest	I	think	is	absolutely	critical	for	human	health	.
I	've	been	involved	with	the	U.S.	Defense	Department	BioShield	program	.
We	submitted	over	300	samples	of	mushrooms	that	were	boiled	in	hot	water	,	and	mycelium	harvesting	these	extracellular	metabolites	.
And	a	few	years	ago	,	we	received	these	results	.
We	have	three	different	strains	of	Agarikon	mushrooms	that	were	highly	active	against	poxviruses	.
Dr.	Earl	Kern	,	who	's	a	smallpox	expert	of	the	U.S.	Defense	Department	,	states	that	any	compounds	that	have	a	selectivity	index	of	two	or	more	are	active	.
10	or	greater	are	considered	to	be	very	active	.
Our	mushroom	strains	were	in	the	highly	active	range	.
There	's	a	vetted	press	release	that	you	can	read	--	it	's	vetted	by	DOD	--	if	you	Google	``	Stamets	''	and	``	smallpox	.	''	Or	you	can	go	to	NPR.org	and	listen	to	a	live	interview	.
So	,	encouraged	by	this	,	naturally	we	went	to	flu	viruses	.
And	so	,	for	the	first	time	,	I	am	showing	this	.
We	have	three	different	strains	of	Agarikon	mushrooms	highly	active	against	flu	viruses	.
Here	's	the	selectivity	index	numbers	--	against	pox	,	you	saw	10s	and	20s	--	now	against	flu	viruses	,	compared	to	the	ribavirin	controls	,	we	have	an	extraordinarily	high	activity	.
And	we	're	using	a	natural	extract	within	the	same	dosage	window	as	a	pure	pharmaceutical	.
We	tried	it	against	flu	A	viruses	--	H1N1	,	H3N2	--	as	well	as	flu	B	viruses	.
So	then	we	tried	a	blend	,	and	in	a	blend	combination	we	tried	it	against	H5N1	,	and	we	got	greater	than	1,000	selectivity	index	.
I	then	think	that	we	can	make	the	argument	that	we	should	save	the	old-growth	forest	as	a	matter	of	national	defense	.
I	became	interested	in	entomopathogenic	fungi	--	fungi	that	kill	insects	.
Our	house	was	being	destroyed	by	carpenter	ants	.
So	,	I	went	to	the	EPA	homepage	,	and	they	were	recommending	studies	with	metarhizium	species	of	a	group	of	fungi	that	kill	carpenter	ants	,	as	well	as	termites	.
I	did	something	that	nobody	else	had	done	.
I	actually	chased	the	mycelium	,	when	it	stopped	producing	spores	.
These	are	spores	--	this	is	in	their	spores	.
I	was	able	to	morph	the	culture	into	a	non-sporulating	form	.
And	so	the	industry	has	spent	over	100	million	dollars	specifically	on	bait	stations	to	prevent	termites	from	eating	your	house	.
But	the	insects	are	n't	stupid	,	and	they	would	avoid	the	spores	when	they	came	close	,	and	so	I	morphed	the	cultures	into	a	non-sporulating	form	.
And	I	got	my	daughter	's	Barbie	doll	dish	,	I	put	it	right	where	a	bunch	of	carpenter	ants	were	making	debris	fields	,	every	day	,	in	my	house	,	and	the	ants	were	attracted	to	the	mycelium	,	because	there	's	no	spores	.
They	gave	it	to	the	queen	.
One	week	later	,	I	had	no	sawdust	piles	whatsoever	.
And	then	--	a	delicate	dance	between	dinner	and	death	--	the	mycelium	is	consumed	by	the	ants	,	they	become	mummified	,	and	,	boing	,	a	mushroom	pops	out	of	their	head	.
Now	after	sporulation	,	the	spores	repel	.
So	,	the	house	is	no	longer	suitable	for	invasion	.
So	,	you	have	a	near-permanent	solution	for	reinvasion	of	termites	.
And	so	my	house	came	down	,	I	received	my	first	patent	against	carpenter	ants	,	termites	and	fire	ants	.
Then	we	tried	extracts	,	and	lo	and	behold	,	we	can	steer	insects	to	different	directions	.
This	has	huge	implications	.
I	then	received	my	second	patent	--	and	this	is	a	big	one	.
It	's	been	called	an	Alexander	Graham	Bell	patent	.	It	covers	over	200,000	species	.
This	is	the	most	disruptive	technology	--	I	've	been	told	by	executives	of	the	pesticide	industry	--	that	they	have	ever	witnessed	.
This	could	totally	revamp	the	pesticide	industries	throughout	the	world	.
You	could	fly	100	Ph.D.	students	under	the	umbrella	of	this	concept	,	because	my	supposition	is	that	entomopathogenic	fungi	,	prior	to	sporulation	,	attract	the	very	insects
that	are	otherwise	repelled	by	those	spores	.
And	so	I	came	up	with	a	Life	Box	,	because	I	needed	a	delivery	system	.
The	Life	Box	--	you	're	gon	na	be	getting	a	DVD	of	the	TED	conference	--	you	add	soil	,	you	add	water	,	you	have	mycorrhizal	and	endophytic	fungi	as	well	as	spores	,	like	of	the	Agarikon	mushroom	.
The	seeds	then	are	mothered	by	this	mycelium	.	And	then	you	put	tree	seeds	in	here	,	and	then	you	end	up	growing	--	potentially	--	an	old-growth	forest	from	a	cardboard	box	.
I	want	to	reinvent	the	delivery	system	,	and	the	use	of	cardboard	around	the	world	,	so	they	become	ecological	footprints	.
If	there	's	a	YouTube-like	site	that	you	could	put	up	,	you	could	make	it	interactive	,	zip	code	specific	--	where	people	could	join	together	,	and	through	satellite	imaging	systems	,	through	Virtual	Earth	or	Google	Earth	,	you	could	confirm	carbon	credits	are	being	sequestered
by	the	trees	that	are	coming	through	Life	Boxes	.
You	could	take	a	cardboard	box	delivering	shoes	,	you	could	add	water	--	I	developed	this	for	the	refugee	community	--	corns	,	beans	and	squash	and	onions	.
I	took	several	containers	--	my	wife	said	,	if	I	could	do	this	,	anybody	could	--	and	I	ended	up	growing	a	seed	garden	.	Then	you	harvest	the	seeds	--	and	thank	you	,	Eric	Rasmussen	,	for	your	help	on	this	--	and	then	you	're	harvesting	the	seed	garden	.
Then	you	can	harvest	the	kernels	,	and	then	you	just	need	a	few	kernels	.	I	add	mycelium	to	it	,	and	then	I	inoculate	the	corncobs	.
Now	,	three	corncobs	,	no	other	grain	--	lots	of	mushrooms	begin	to	form	.	Too	many	withdrawals	from	the	carbon	bank	,	and	so	this	population	will	be	shut	down	.
But	watch	what	happens	here	.
The	mushrooms	then	are	harvested	,	but	very	importantly	,	the	mycelium	has	converted	the	cellulose	into	fungal	sugars	.
And	so	I	thought	,	how	could	we	address	the	energy	crisis	in	this	country	?
And	we	came	up	with	Econol	.
Generating	ethanol	from	cellulose	using	mycelium	as	an	intermediary	--	and	you	gain	all	the	benefits	that	I	've	described	to	you	already	.
But	to	go	from	cellulose	to	ethanol	is	ecologically	unintelligent	,	and	I	think	that	we	need	to	be	econologically	intelligent	about	the	generation	of	fuels	.
So	,	we	build	the	carbon	banks	on	the	planet	,	renew	the	soils	.	These	are	a	species	that	we	need	to	join	with	.
I	think	engaging	mycelium	can	help	save	the	world	.
Thank	you	very	much	.
I	have	had	the	distinct	pleasure	of	living	inside	two	biospheres	.
Of	course	we	all	here	in	this	room	live	in	Biosphere	1	.
I	've	also	lived	in	Biosphere	2	.
And	the	wonderful	thing	about	that	is	that	I	get	to	compare	biospheres	.	And	hopefully	from	that	I	get	to	learn	something	.
So	what	did	I	learn	?	Well	,	here	I	am	inside	Biosphere	2	,	making	a	pizza	.
So	I	am	harvesting	the	wheat	,	in	order	to	make	the	dough	.
And	then	of	course	I	have	to	milk	the	goats	and	feed	the	goats	in	order	to	make	the	cheese	.
It	took	me	four	months	in	Biosphere	2	to	make	a	pizza	.
Here	in	Biosphere	1	,	well	it	takes	me	about	two	minutes	,
because	I	pick	up	the	phone	and	I	call	and	say	,	``	Hey	,	can	you	deliver	the	pizza	?	''
So	Biosphere	2	was	essentially	a	three-acre	,	entirely	sealed	,	miniature	world	that	I	lived	in	for	two	years	and	20	minutes	.
Over	the	top	it	was	sealed	with	steel	and	glass	,
underneath	it	was	sealed	with	a	pan	of	steel	--
essentially	entirely	sealed	.
So	we	had	our	own	miniature	rainforest	,	a	private	beach	with	a	coral	reef	.
We	had	a	savanna	,	a	marsh	,	a	desert	.
We	had	our	own	half-acre	farm	that	we	had	to	grow	everything	.
And	of	course	we	had	our	human	habitat	,	where	we	lived	.
Back	in	the	mid-'80s	when	we	were	designing	Biosphere	2	,	we	had	to	ask	ourselves	some	pretty	basic	questions	.
I	mean	,	what	is	a	biosphere	?
Back	then	,	yes	,	I	guess	we	all	know	now	that	it	is	essentially	the	sphere	of	life	around	the	Earth	,	right	?
Well	,	you	have	to	get	a	little	more	specific	than	that	if	you	're	going	to	build	one	.
And	so	we	decided	that	what	it	really	is	is	that	it	is	entirely	materially	closed	--	that	is	,	nothing	goes	in	or	out	at	all	,	no	material	--	and	energetically	open	,
which	is	essentially	what	planet	Earth	is	.
This	is	a	chamber	that	was	1/400th	the	size	of	Biosphere	2	that	we	called	our	Test	Module	.
And	the	very	first	day	that	this	fellow	,	John	Allen	,	walked	in	,	to	spend	a	couple	of	days	in	there	with	all	the	plants	and	animals	and	bacteria	that	we	'd	put	in	there	to	hopefully	keep	him	alive	,	the	doctors	were	incredibly	concerned	that	he	was	going	to	succumb	to	some	dreadful	toxin	,	or	that	his	lungs	were	going	to	get	choked	with	bacteria	or	something	,	fungus	.
But	of	course	none	of	that	happened	.
And	over	the	ensuing	few	years	,	there	were	great	sagas	about	designing	Biosphere	2	.
But	by	1991	we	finally	had	this	thing	built	.
And	it	was	time	for	us	to	go	in	and	give	it	a	go	.
We	needed	to	know	,	is	life	this	malleable	?
Can	you	take	this	biosphere	,	that	has	evolved	on	a	planetary	scale	,	and	jam	it	into	a	little	bottle	,	and	will	it	survive	?
Big	questions	.
And	we	wanted	to	know	this	both	for	being	able	to	go	somewhere	else	in	the	universe	--	if	we	were	going	to	go	to	Mars	,	for	instance	,	would	we	take	a	biosphere	with	us	,	to	live	in	it	?	We	also	wanted	to	know	so	we	can	understand	more	about	the	Earth	that	we	all	live	in	.
Well	,	in	1991	it	was	finally	time	for	us	to	go	in	and	try	out	this	baby	.
Let	's	take	it	on	a	maiden	voyage	.
Will	it	work	?	Or	will	something	happen	that	we	ca	n't	understand	and	we	ca	n't	fix	,
thereby	negating	the	concept	of	man-made	biospheres	?
So	eight	of	us	went	in	:	four	men	and	four	women	.
More	on	that	later	.
And	this	is	the	world	that	we	lived	in	.
So	,	on	the	top	,	we	had	these	beautiful	rainforests	and	an	ocean	,
and	underneath	we	had	all	this	technosphere	,	we	called	it	,
which	is	where	all	the	pumps	and	the	valves	and	the	water	tanks	and	the	air	handlers	,	and	all	of	that	.
One	of	the	Biospherians	called	it	``	garden	of	Eden	on	top	of	an	aircraft	carrier	.	''
And	then	also	we	had	the	human	habitat	of	course	,	with	the	laboratories	,	and	all	of	that	.
This	is	the	agriculture	.
It	was	essentially	an	organic	farm	.
The	day	I	walked	into	Biosphere	2	,	I	was	,	for	the	first	time	,	breathing	a	completely	different	atmosphere	than	everybody	else	in	the	world	,	except	seven	other	people	.
At	that	moment	I	became	part	of	that	biosphere	.
And	I	do	n't	mean	that	in	an	abstract	sense	;
I	mean	it	rather	literally	.
When	I	breathed	out	,	my	CO2	fed	the	sweet	potatoes	that	I	was	growing	.
And	we	ate	an	awful	lot	of	the	sweet	potatoes	.
And	those	sweet	potatoes	became	part	of	me	.
In	fact	,	we	ate	so	many	sweet	potatoes	I	became	orange	with	sweet	potato	.
I	literally	was	eating	the	same	carbon	over	and	over	again	.
I	was	eating	myself	in	some	strange	sort	of	bizarre	way	.
When	it	came	to	our	atmosphere	,	however	,	it	was	n't	that	much	of	a	joke	over	the	long	term	,
because	it	turned	out	that	we	were	losing	oxygen	,	quite	a	lot	of	oxygen	.
And	we	knew	that	we	were	losing	CO2	.
And	so	we	were	working	to	sequester	carbon	.
Good	lord	--	we	know	that	term	now	.
We	were	growing	plants	like	crazy	.
We	were	taking	their	biomass	,	storing	them	in	the	basement	,	growing	plants	,	going	around	,	around	,	around	,	trying	to	take	all	of	that	carbon	out	of	the	atmosphere	.
We	were	trying	to	stop	carbon	from	going	into	the	atmosphere	.
We	stopped	irrigating	our	soil	,	as	much	as	we	could	.
We	stopped	tilling	,	so	that	we	could	prevent	greenhouse	gasses	from	going	into	the	air	.
But	our	oxygen	was	going	down	faster	than	our	CO2	was	going	up	,	which	was	quite	unexpected	,
because	we	had	seen	them	going	in	tandem	in	the	test	module	.
And	it	was	like	playing	atomic	hide-and-seek	.
We	had	lost	seven	tons	of	oxygen	.
And	we	had	no	clue	where	it	was	.
And	I	tell	you	,	when	you	lose	a	lot	of	oxygen	--	and	our	oxygen	went	down	quite	far	;	it	went	from	21	percent	down	to	14.2	percent	--	my	goodness	,	do	you	feel	dreadful	.
I	mean	we	were	dragging	ourselves	around	the	Biosphere	.
And	we	had	sleep	apnea	at	night	.
So	you	'd	wake	up	gasping	with	breath	,	because	your	blood	chemistry	has	changed	.
And	that	you	literally	do	that	.	You	stop	breathing	and	then	you	--	--	take	a	breath	and	it	wakes	you	up	.	And	it	's	very	irritating	.
And	everybody	outside	thought	we	were	dying	.
I	mean	,	the	media	was	making	it	sound	like	were	were	dying	.
And	I	had	to	call	up	my	mother	every	other	day	saying	,	``	No	,	Mum	,	it	's	fine	,	fine	.
We	're	not	dead	.	We	're	fine	.	We	're	fine	.	''	And	the	doctor	was	,	in	fact	,	checking	us	to	make	sure	we	were	,	in	fact	,	fine	.
But	in	fact	he	was	the	person	who	was	most	susceptible	to	the	oxygen	.
And	one	day	he	could	n't	add	up	a	line	of	figures	.
And	it	was	time	for	us	to	put	oxygen	in	.
And	you	might	think	,	well	,	``	Boy	,	your	life	support	system	was	failing	you	.	Was	n't	that	dreadful	?	''	Yes	.	In	a	sense	it	was	terrifying	.
Except	that	I	knew	I	could	walk	out	the	airlock	door	at	any	time	,	if	it	really	got	bad	,
though	who	was	going	to	say	,	``	I	ca	n't	take	it	anymore	!	``	?
Not	me	,	that	was	for	sure	.
But	on	the	other	hand	,	it	was	the	scientific	gold	of	the	project	,
because	we	could	really	crank	this	baby	up	,	as	a	scientific	tool	,	and	see	if	we	could	,	in	fact	,	find	where	those	seven	tons	of	oxygen	had	gone	.
And	we	did	indeed	find	it	.
And	we	found	it	in	the	concrete	.
Essentially	it	had	done	something	very	simple	.
We	had	put	too	much	carbon	in	the	soil	in	the	form	of	compost	.
It	broke	down	;	it	took	oxygen	out	of	the	air	;
it	put	CO2	into	the	air	;	and	it	went	into	the	concrete	.
Pretty	straightforward	really	.
So	at	the	end	of	the	two	years	when	we	came	out	,	we	were	elated	,
because	,	in	fact	,	although	you	might	say	we	had	discovered	something	that	was	quite	``	uhh	,	''	when	your	oxygen	is	going	down	,	stopped	working	,	essentially	,	in	your	life	support	system	,	that	's	a	very	bad	failure	.
Except	that	we	knew	what	it	was	.	And	we	knew	how	to	fix	it	.
And	nothing	else	emerged	that	really	was	as	serious	as	that	.
And	we	proved	the	concept	,	more	or	less	.
People	,	on	the	other	hand	,	was	a	different	subject	.
We	were	--	yeah	I	do	n't	know	that	we	were	fixable	.
We	all	went	quite	nuts	,	I	will	say	.
And	the	day	I	came	out	of	Biosphere	2	,	I	was	thrilled	I	was	going	to	see	all	my	family	and	my	friends	.
For	two	years	I	'd	been	seeing	people	through	the	glass	.
And	everybody	ran	up	to	me	.
And	I	recoiled	.	They	stank	!
People	stink	!
We	stink	of	hairspray	and	underarm	deodorant	,	and	all	kinds	of	stuff	.
Now	we	had	stuff	inside	Biosphere	to	keep	ourselves	clean	,
but	nothing	with	perfume	.
And	boy	do	we	stink	out	here	.
Not	only	that	,	but	I	lost	touch	of	where	my	food	came	from	.
I	had	been	growing	all	my	own	food	.
I	had	no	idea	what	was	in	my	food	,	where	it	came	from	.
I	did	n't	even	recognize	half	the	names	in	most	of	the	food	that	I	was	eating	.
In	fact	,	I	would	stand	for	hours	in	the	aisles	of	shops	,	reading	all	the	names	on	all	of	the	things	.
People	must	have	thought	I	was	nuts	.
It	was	really	quite	astonishing	.
And	I	slowly	lost	track	of	where	I	was	in	this	big	biosphere	,	in	this	big	biosphere	that	we	all	live	in	.
In	Biosphere	2	I	totally	understood	that	I	had	a	huge	impact	on	my	biosphere	,	everyday	,	and	it	had	an	impact	on	me	,	very	viscerally	,	very	literally	.
So	I	went	about	my	business	:	Paragon	Space	Development	Corporation	,	a	little	firm	I	started	with	people	while	I	was	in	the	Biosphere	,	because	I	had	nothing	else	to	do	.
And	one	of	the	things	we	did	was	try	to	figure	out	:	how	small	can	you	make	these	biospheres	,
and	what	can	you	do	with	them	?
And	so	we	sent	one	onto	the	Mir	Space	Station	.
We	had	one	on	the	shuttle	and	one	on	the	International	Space	Station	,	for	16	months	,	where	we	managed	to	produce	the	first	organisms	to	go	through	complete	multiple	life	cycles	in	space	--
really	pushing	the	envelope	of	understanding	how	malleable	our	life	systems	are	.
And	I	'm	also	proud	to	announce	that	you	're	getting	a	sneak	preview	--	on	Friday	we	're	going	to	announce	that	we	're	actually	forming	a	team	to	develop	a	system	to	grow	plants	on	the	Moon	,
which	is	going	to	be	pretty	fun	.
And	the	legacy	of	that	is	a	system	that	we	were	designing	:	an	entirely	sealed	system	to	grow	plants	to	grow	on	Mars	.
And	part	of	that	is	that	we	had	to	model	very	rapid	circulation	of	CO2	and	oxygen	and	water	through	this	plant	system	.
As	a	result	of	that	modeling	I	ended	up	in	all	places	,	in	Eritrea	,	in	the	Horn	of	Africa	.
Eritrea	,	formerly	part	of	Ethiopia	,	is	one	of	those	places	that	is	astonishingly	beautiful	,	incredibly	stark	,	and	I	have	no	understanding	of	how	people	eke	out	a	living	there	.
It	is	so	dry	.
This	is	what	I	saw	.
But	this	is	also	what	I	saw	.
I	saw	a	company	that	had	taken	seawater	and	sand	,	and	they	were	growing	a	kind	of	crop	that	will	grow	on	pure	salt	water	without	having	to	treat	it	.
And	it	will	produce	a	food	crop	.
In	this	case	it	was	oilseed	.
It	was	astonishing	.	They	were	also	producing	mangroves	in	a	plantation	.
And	the	mangroves	were	providing	wood	and	honey	and	leaves	for	the	animals	,	so	that	they	could	produce	milk	and	whatnot	,	like	we	had	in	the	Biosphere	.
And	all	of	it	was	coming	from	this	:	shrimp	farms	.
Shrimp	farms	are	a	scourge	on	the	earth	,	frankly	,	from	an	environmental	point	of	view	.
They	pour	huge	amounts	of	pollutants	into	the	ocean	.
They	also	pollute	their	next-door	neighbors	.
And	what	this	project	was	doing	was	taking	the	effluent	of	these	,	and	turning	them	into	all	of	this	food	.
They	were	literally	turning	pollution	into	abundance	for	a	desert	people	.
They	had	created	an	industrial	ecosystem	,	of	a	sense	.
I	was	there	because	I	was	actually	modeling	the	mangrove	portion	for	a	carbon	credit	program	,	under	the	U.N.	Kyoto	Protocol	system	.
And	as	I	was	modeling	this	mangrove	swamp	,	I	was	thinking	to	myself	,	``	How	do	you	put	a	box	around	this	?	''	When	I	'm	modeling	a	plant	in	a	box	,	literally	,	I	know	where	to	draw	the	boundary	.
In	a	mangrove	forest	like	this	I	have	no	idea	.
Well	,	of	course	you	have	to	draw	the	boundary	around	the	whole	of	the	Earth	.
And	understand	its	interactions	with	the	entire	Earth	.
And	put	your	project	in	that	context	.
Around	the	world	today	we	're	seeing	an	incredible	transformation	,	from	what	I	would	call	a	biocidal	species	,	one	that	--	whether	we	intentionally	or	unintentionally	--	have	designed	our	systems	to	kill	life	,	a	lot	of	the	time	.
This	is	in	fact	,	this	beautiful	photograph	,	is	in	fact	over	the	Amazon	.	And	here	the	light	green	are	areas	of	massive	deforestation	.
And	those	beautiful	wispy	clouds	are	,	in	fact	,	fires	,	human-made	fires	.
We	're	in	the	process	of	transforming	from	this	,	to	what	I	would	call	a	biophilic	society	,	one	where	we	learn	to	nurture	society	.
Now	it	may	not	seem	like	it	,	but	we	are	.
It	is	happening	all	across	the	world	,	in	every	kind	of	walk	of	life	,	and	every	kind	of	career	and	industry	that	you	can	think	of	.
And	I	think	often	times	people	get	lost	in	that	.
They	go	,	``	But	how	can	I	possibly	find	my	way	in	that	?
It	's	such	a	huge	subject	.	''	And	I	would	say	that	the	small	stuff	counts	.	It	really	does	.
This	is	the	story	of	a	rake	in	my	backyard	.
This	was	my	backyard	,	very	early	on	,	when	I	bought	my	property	.
And	in	Arizona	,	of	course	,	everybody	puts	gravel	down	.
And	they	like	to	keep	everything	beautifully	raked	.	And	they	keep	all	the	leaves	away	.
And	on	Sunday	morning	the	neighbors	leaf	blower	comes	out	,	and	I	want	to	throttle	them	.
It	's	a	certain	type	of	aesthetic	.
We	're	very	uncomfortable	with	untidiness	.
And	I	threw	away	my	rake	.
And	I	let	all	of	the	leaves	fall	from	the	trees	that	I	have	on	my	property	.
And	over	time	,	essentially	what	have	I	been	doing	?
I	've	been	building	topsoil	.
And	so	now	all	the	birds	come	in	.	And	I	have	hawks	.
And	I	have	an	oasis	.
This	is	what	happens	every	spring	.	For	six	weeks	,	six	to	eight	weeks	,	I	have	this	flush	of	green	oasis	.
This	is	actually	in	a	riparian	area	.
And	all	of	Tucson	could	be	like	this	if	everybody	would	just	revolt	and	throw	away	the	rake	.
The	small	stuff	counts	.
The	Industrial	Revolution	--	and	Prometheus	--	has	given	us	this	,	the	ability	to	light	up	the	world	.
It	has	also	given	us	this	,	the	ability	to	look	at	the	world	from	the	outside	.
Now	we	may	not	all	have	another	biosphere	that	we	can	run	to	,	and	compare	it	to	this	biosphere	.
But	we	can	look	at	the	world	,	and	try	to	understand	where	we	are	in	its	context	,	and	how	we	choose	to	interact	with	it	.
And	if	you	lose	where	you	are	in	your	biosphere	,	or	are	perhaps	having	a	difficulty	connecting	with	where	you	are	in	the	biosphere	,	I	would	say	to	you	,	take	a	deep	breath	.
The	yogis	had	it	right	.
Breath	does	,	in	fact	,	connect	us	all
in	a	very	literal	way	.
Take	a	breath	now	.
And	as	you	breathe	,	think	about	what	is	in	your	breath	.
There	perhaps	is	the	CO2	from	the	person	sitting	next-door	to	you	.
Maybe	there	is	a	little	bit	of	oxygen	from	some	algae	on	the	beach	not	far	from	here	.
It	also	connects	us	in	time	.
There	may	be	some	carbon	in	your	breath	from	the	dinosaurs	.
There	could	also	be	carbon	that	you	are	exhaling	now	that	will	be	in	the	breath	of	your	great-great-great-grandchildren	.
What	I	'd	like	you	to	do	is	,	just	really	quickly	,	is	just	,	sort	of	,	nod	to	the	person	on	your	right	,	and	then	nod	to	the	person	on	your	left	.
Now	,	chances	are	that	over	the	last	winter	,	if	you	had	been	a	beehive	,	either	you	or	one	of	the	two	people	you	just	nodded	at	would	have	died	.
Now	,	that	's	an	awful	lot	of	bees	.
And	this	is	the	second	year	in	a	row	we	have	lost	over	30	percent	of	the	colonies	,	or	we	estimate	we	've	lost	30	percent	of	the	colonies	over	the	winter	.
Now	,	that	's	a	lot	,	a	lot	of	bees	,	and	that	's	really	important	.
And	most	of	those	losses	are	because	of	things	we	know	.
We	know	that	there	are	these	varroa	mites	that	have	introduced	and	caused	a	lot	of	losses	,	and	we	also	have	this	new	phenomenon	,	which	I	talked	about	last	year	,	Colony	Collapse	Disorder	.
And	here	we	see	a	picture	on	top	of	a	hill	in	Central	Valley	last	December	.
And	below	,	you	can	see	all	these	out	yards	,	or	temporary	yards	,	where	the	colonies	are	brought	in	until	February	,	and	then	they	're	shipped	out	to	the	almonds	.
And	one	documentary	writer	,	who	was	here	and	looked	at	this	two	months	after	I	was	here	,	described	this	not	as	beehives	but	as	a	graveyard	,	with	these	empty	white	boxes	with	no	bees	left	in	them	.
Now	,	I	'm	going	to	sum	up	a	year	's	worth	of	work	in	two	sentences	to	say	that	we	have	been	trying	to	figure	out	what	the	cause	of	this	is	.
And	what	we	know	is	that	it	's	as	if	the	bees	have	caught	a	flu	.
And	this	flu	has	wiped	through	the	population	of	bees	.
In	some	cases	,	and	in	fact	in	most	cases	in	one	year	,	this	flu	was	caused	by	a	new	virus	to	us	,	or	newly	identified	by	us	,	called	Israeli	Acute	Paralysis	virus	.
It	was	called	that	because	a	guy	in	Israel	first	found	it	,	and	he	now	regrets	profoundly	calling	it	that	disease	,	because	,	of	course	,	there	's	the	implication	.
But	we	think	this	virus	is	pretty	ubiquitous	.
It	's	also	pretty	clear	that	the	bees	sometimes	catch	other	viruses	or	other	flus	,	and	so	the	question	we	're	still	struggling	with	,	and	the	question	that	keeps	us	up	at	night	,	is	why	have	the	bees	suddenly	become	so	susceptible	to	this	flu	,	and	why	are	they	so	susceptible	to	these	other	diseases	?
And	we	do	n't	have	the	answer	to	that	yet	,	and	we	spend	a	lot	of	time	trying	to	figure	that	out	.
We	think	perhaps	it	's	a	combination	of	factors	.
We	know	from	the	work	of	a	very	large	and	dynamic	working	team	that	,	you	know	,	we	're	finding	a	lot	of	different	pesticides	in	the	hive	,	and	surprisingly	,	sometimes	the	healthiest	hives	have	the	most	pesticides	.	And	so	we	discover	all	these	very	strange	things	that	we	ca	n't	begin	to	understand	.
And	so	this	opens	up	the	whole	idea	of	looking	at	colony	health	.
Now	of	course	,	if	you	lose	a	lot	of	colonies	,	beekeepers	can	replace	them	very	quickly	.
And	that	's	why	we	've	been	able	to	recover	from	a	lot	of	loss	.
If	we	lost	one	in	every	three	cows	in	the	winter	,	you	know	,	the	National	Guard	would	be	out	.
But	what	beekeepers	can	do	is	,	if	they	have	one	surviving	colony	,	they	can	split	that	colony	in	two	.
And	then	the	one	half	that	does	n't	have	a	queen	,	they	can	buy	a	queen	.
It	comes	in	the	mail	;	it	can	come	from	Australia	or	Hawaii	or	Florida	,	and	you	can	introduce	that	queen	.
And	in	fact	,	America	was	the	first	country	that	ever	did	mail-delivery	queens	and	in	fact	,	it	's	part	of	the	postal	code	that	you	have	to	deliver	queens	by	mail	in	order	to	make	sure	that	we	have	enough	bees	in	this	country	.
If	you	do	n't	just	want	a	queen	,	you	can	buy	,	actually	,	a	three-pound	package	of	bees	,	which	comes	in	the	mail	,	and	of	course	,	the	Postal	Office	is	always	very	concerned	when	they	get	,	you	know	,	your	three-pound	packages	of	bees	.
And	you	can	install	this	in	your	hive	and	replace	that	dead-out	.
So	it	means	that	beekeepers	are	very	good	at	replacing	dead-outs	,	and	so	they	've	been	able	to	cover	those	losses	.
So	even	though	we	've	lost	30	percent	of	the	colonies	every	year	,	the	same	number	of	colonies	have	existed	in	the	country	,	at	about	2.4	million	colonies	.
Now	,	those	losses	are	tragic	on	many	fronts	,	and	one	of	those	fronts	is	for	the	beekeeper	.
And	it	's	really	important	to	talk	about	beekeepers	first	,	because	beekeepers	are	among	the	most	fascinating	people	you	'll	ever	meet	.
If	this	was	a	group	of	beekeepers	,	you	would	have	everyone	from	the	card-carrying	NRA	member	who	's	,	you	know	,	live	free	or	die	,	to	the	,	you	know	,	the	self-expressed	quirky	San	Francisco	backyard	pig	farmer	.
And	you	get	all	of	these	people	in	the	same	room	,	and	they	're	all	engaged	and	they	're	getting	along	,	and	they	're	all	there	because	of	the	passion	for	bees	.
Now	,	there	's	another	part	of	that	community	which	are	the	commercial	beekeepers	,	the	ones	who	make	their	livelihood	from	beekeeping	alone	.
And	these	tend	to	be	some	of	the	most	independent	,	tenacious	,	intuitive	,	you	know	,	inventive	people	you	will	ever	meet	.
They	're	just	fascinating	.	And	they	're	like	that	all	over	the	world	.
I	had	the	privilege	of	working	in	Haiti	just	for	two	weeks	earlier	this	year	.
And	Haiti	,	if	you	've	ever	been	there	,	is	just	a	tragedy	.
I	mean	,	there	may	be	100	explanations	for	why	Haiti	is	the	impoverished	nation	it	is	,	but	there	is	no	excuse	to	see	that	sort	of	squalor	.
But	you	meet	this	beekeeper	,	and	I	met	this	beekeeper	here	,	and	he	is	one	of	the	most	knowledgeable	beekeepers	I	've	ever	met	.
No	formal	education	,	but	very	knowledgeable	.
We	needed	beeswax	for	a	project	we	were	working	on	;	he	was	so	capable	,	he	was	able	to	render	the	nicest	block	of	beeswax	I	have	ever	seen	from	cow	dung	,	tin	cans	and	his	veil	,	which	he	used	as	a	screening	,	right	in	this	meadow	.	And	so	that	ingenuity	is	inspiring	.
We	also	have	Dave	Hackenberg	,	who	is	the	poster	child	of	CCD	.
He	's	the	one	who	first	identified	this	condition	and	raised	the	alarm	bells	.
And	he	has	a	history	of	these	trucks	,	and	he	's	moved	these	bees	up	and	down	the	coast	.
And	a	lot	of	people	talk	about	trucks	and	moving	bees	,	and	that	being	bad	,	but	we	've	done	that	for	thousands	of	years	.
The	ancient	Egyptians	used	to	move	bees	up	and	down	the	Nile	on	rafts	,	so	this	idea	of	a	movable	bee	force	is	not	new	at	all	.
And	one	of	our	real	worries	with	Colony	Collapse	Disorder	is	the	fact	that	it	costs	so	much	money	to	replace	those	dead-out	colonies	.
And	you	can	do	that	one	year	in	a	row	,	you	may	be	able	to	do	it	two	years	in	a	row	.
But	if	you	're	losing	50	percent	to	80	percent	of	your	colonies	,	you	ca	n't	survive	three	years	in	a	row	.	And	we	're	really	worried	about	losing	this	segment	of	our	industry	.
And	that	's	important	for	many	fronts	,	and	one	of	them	is	because	of	that	culture	that	's	in	agriculture	.
And	these	migratory	beekeepers	are	the	last	nomads	of	America	.
You	know	,	they	pick	up	their	hives	;	they	move	their	families	once	or	twice	in	a	year	.
And	if	you	look	at	Florida	,	in	Dade	City	,	Florida	,	that	's	where	all	the	Pennsylvania	beekeepers	go	.
And	then	20	miles	down	the	road	is	Groveland	,	and	that	's	where	all	the	Wisconsin	beekeepers	go	.
And	if	you	're	ever	in	Central	Valley	in	February	,	you	go	to	this	café	at	10	o'clock	in	the	morning	,	Kathy	and	Kate	's	.
And	that	's	where	all	the	beekeepers	come	after	a	night	of	moving	bees	into	the	almond	groves	.
They	all	have	their	breakfast	and	complain	about	everyone	right	there	.	And	it	's	a	great	experience	,	and	I	really	encourage	you	to	drop	in	at	that	diner	during	that	time	,	because	that	's	quite	essential	American	experience	.
And	we	see	these	families	,	these	nomadic	families	,	you	know	,	father	to	son	,	father	to	son	,	and	these	guys	are	hurting	.
And	they	're	not	people	who	like	to	ask	for	help	,	although	they	are	the	most	helpful	people	ever	.
If	there	's	one	guy	who	loses	all	his	bees	because	of	a	truck	overhaul	,	everyone	pitches	in	and	gives	20	hives	to	help	him	replace	those	lost	colonies	.
And	so	,	it	's	a	very	dynamic	,	and	I	think	,	historic	and	exciting	community	to	be	involved	with	.
Of	course	,	the	real	importance	for	bees	is	not	the	honey	.
And	although	I	highly	encourage	you	,	all	use	honey	.
I	mean	,	it	's	the	most	ethical	sweetener	,	and	you	know	,	it	's	a	dynamic	and	fun	sweetener	.
But	we	estimate	that	about	one	in	three	bites	of	food	we	eat	is	directly	or	indirectly	pollinated	by	honeybees	.
Now	,	I	want	to	just	illustrate	that	in	the	fact	that	if	we	look	at	the	breakfast	I	had	yesterday	morning	--	a	little	cranberry	juice	,	some	fruits	,	some	granola	,	I	should	have	had	whole	wheat	bread	,	I	realized	,	but	you	know	,	jam	on	my	Wonderbread	,	and	some	coffee	--	and	had	we	taken	out	all	those	ingredients	,	--	except	for	the	almonds	I	was	n't	going	to	pick	out	from	the	granola	--	if	we	had	taken	out	all	those	ingredients	the	bees	had	indirectly	or	directly	pollinated	,	we	would	n't	have	much	on	our	plate	.
So	if	we	did	not	have	bees	,	it	's	not	like	we	would	starve	,	but	clearly	our	diet	would	be	diminished	.
It	's	said	that	for	bees	,	the	flower	is	the	fountain	of	life	,	and	for	flowers	bees	are	the	messengers	of	love	.
And	that	's	a	really	great	expression	,	because	really	,	bees	are	the	sex	workers	for	flowers	.	They	are	,	you	know	--	they	get	paid	for	their	services	.
They	get	paid	by	pollen	and	nectar	,	to	move	that	male	sperm	,	the	pollen	,	from	flower	to	flower	.	And	there	are	flowers	that	are	self-infertile	.	That	means	they	ca	n't	--	the	pollen	in	their	bloom	ca	n't	fertilize	themselves	.
So	in	an	apple	orchard	,	for	instance	,	you	'll	have	rows	of	10	apples	of	one	variety	,	and	then	you	have	another	apple	tree	that	's	a	different	type	of	pollen	.
And	bees	are	very	faithful	.
When	they	're	out	pollinating	or	gathering	pollen	from	one	flower	,	they	stay	to	that	crop	exclusively	,	in	order	to	help	generate	.
And	of	course	,	they	're	made	to	carry	this	pollen	.
They	build	up	a	static	electric	charge	and	the	pollen	jumps	on	them	and	helps	spread	that	pollen	from	bloom	to	bloom	.
However	,	honeybees	are	a	minority	.
Honeybees	are	not	native	to	America	;	they	were	introduced	with	the	colonialists	.
And	there	are	actually	more	species	of	bees	than	there	are	mammals	and	birds	combined	.
In	Pennsylvania	alone	,	we	have	been	surveying	bees	for	150	years	,	and	very	intensely	in	the	last	three	years	.
We	have	identified	over	400	species	of	bees	in	Pennsylvania	.
Thirty-two	species	have	not	been	identified	or	found	in	the	state	since	1950	.
Now	,	that	could	be	because	we	have	n't	been	sampling	right	,	but	it	does	,	I	think	,	suggest	that	something	's	wrong	with	the	pollinator	force	.	And	these	bees	are	fascinating	.
We	have	bumblebees	on	the	top	.
And	bumblebees	are	what	we	call	eusocial	:	they	're	not	truly	social	,	because	only	the	queen	is	,	over	winter	.
We	also	have	the	sweat	bees	,	and	these	are	little	gems	flying	around	.
They	're	like	tiny	little	flies	and	they	fly	around	.
And	then	you	have	another	type	of	bee	,	which	we	call	kleptoparasites	,	which	is	a	very	fancy	way	of	saying	,	bad-minded	,	murdering	--	what	's	the	word	I	'm	looking	for	?	Murdering	--	Audience	:	Bee	?
Dennis	vanEngelsdorp	:	Bee	.	Okay	,	thanks	.
What	these	bees	do	is	,	they	sit	there	.	These	solitary	bees	,	they	drill	a	hole	in	the	ground	or	drill	a	hole	in	a	branch	,	and	they	collect	pollen	and	make	it	into	a	ball	,	and	they	lay	an	egg	on	it	.
Well	,	these	bees	hang	out	at	that	hole	,	and	they	wait	for	that	mother	to	fly	away	,	they	go	in	,	eat	the	egg	,	and	lay	their	own	egg	there	.	So	they	do	n't	do	any	work	.
And	so	,	in	fact	,	if	you	know	you	have	these	kleptoparasitic	bees	,	you	know	that	your	environment	is	healthy	,	because	they	're	top-of-the-food-chain	bees	.
And	in	fact	,	there	is	now	a	red	list	of	pollinators	that	we	're	worried	have	disappeared	,	and	on	top	of	that	list	are	a	lot	of	these	kleptoparasites	,	but	also	these	bumblebees	.
And	in	fact	,	if	you	guys	live	on	the	West	Coast	,	go	to	these	websites	here	,	and	they	're	really	looking	for	people	to	look	for	some	of	these	bumblebees	,	because	we	think	some	have	gone	extinct	.	Or	some	,	the	population	has	declined	.
And	so	it	's	not	just	honeybees	that	are	in	trouble	,	but	we	do	n't	understand	these	native	pollinators	or	all	those	other	parts	of	our	community	.
And	of	course	,	bees	are	not	the	only	important	factor	here	.
There	are	other	animals	that	pollinate	,	like	bats	,	and	bats	are	in	trouble	too	.
And	I	'm	glad	I	'm	a	bee	man	and	not	a	bat	man	,	because	there	's	no	money	to	research	the	bat	problems	.
And	bats	are	dying	at	an	extraordinary	rate	.
White-nose	syndrome	has	wiped	out	populations	of	bats	.
If	there	's	a	cave	in	New	York	that	had	15,000	bats	in	it	,	and	there	are	1,000	left	.	That	's	like	San	Francisco	becoming	the	population	of	half	of	this	county	in	three	years	.
And	so	that	's	incredible	.	And	there	's	no	money	to	do	that	.	But	I	'm	glad	to	say	that	I	think	we	know	the	cause	of	all	these	conditions	,	and	that	cause	is	NDD	:	Nature	Deficit	Disorder	.
And	that	is	that	I	think	that	what	we	have	in	our	society	is	,	we	forgot	our	connection	with	nature	.
And	I	think	if	we	reconnect	to	nature	,	we	'll	be	able	to	have	the	resources	and	that	interest	to	solve	these	problems	.
And	I	think	that	there	is	an	easy	cure	for	NDD	.
And	that	is	,	make	meadows	and	not	lawns	.
And	I	think	we	have	lost	our	connection	,	and	this	is	a	wonderful	way	of	reconnecting	to	our	environment	.
I	've	had	the	privilege	of	living	by	a	meadow	for	the	last	little	while	,	and	it	is	terribly	engaging	.
And	if	we	look	at	the	history	of	lawns	,	it	's	actually	rather	tragic	.
It	used	to	be	,	two	,	three	hundred	years	ago	,	that	a	lawn	was	a	symbol	of	prestige	,	and	so	it	was	only	the	very	rich	that	could	keep	these	green	actually	,	deserts	:	they	're	totally	sterile	.
Americans	spent	,	in	2001	--	11	percent	of	all	pesticide	use	was	done	on	lawns	.
Five	percent	of	our	greenhouse	gases	are	produced	by	mowing	our	lawns	.
And	so	it	's	incredible	the	amount	of	resources	we	've	spent	keeping	our	lawns	,	which	are	these	useless	biosystems	.
And	so	we	need	to	rethink	this	idea	.
In	fact	,	you	know	,	the	White	House	used	to	have	sheep	in	front	in	order	to	help	fund	the	war	effort	in	World	War	I	,	which	probably	is	not	a	bad	idea	;	it	would	n't	be	a	bad	idea	.
I	want	to	say	this	not	because	I	'm	opposed	completely	to	mowing	lawns	.
I	think	that	there	is	perhaps	some	advantage	to	keeping	lawns	at	a	limited	scale	,	and	I	think	we	're	encouraged	to	do	that	.
But	I	also	want	to	reinforce	some	of	the	ideas	we	've	heard	here	,	because	having	a	meadow	or	living	by	a	meadow	is	transformational	.
That	it	is	amazing	that	connection	we	can	have	with	what	's	there	.
These	milkweed	plants	have	grown	up	in	my	meadow	over	the	last	four	years	.	Add	to	watch	the	different	plants	,	or	insects	,	that	come	to	these	flowers	,	to	watch	that	--	and	we	've	heard	about	,	you	know	,	this	relationship	you	can	have	with	wine	,	this	companion	you	can	have	as	it	matures	and	as	it	has	these	different	fragrances	.
And	this	is	a	companion	,	and	this	is	a	relationship	that	never	dries	up	.
You	never	run	out	of	that	companion	as	you	drink	this	wine	,	too	.
And	I	encourage	you	to	look	at	that	.
Now	,	not	all	of	us	have	meadows	,	or	lawns	that	we	can	convert	,	and	so	you	can	always	,	of	course	,	grow	a	meadow	in	a	pot	.
Bees	apparently	,	can	be	the	gateway	to	,	you	know	,	other	things	.
So	I	'm	not	saying	that	you	should	plant	a	meadow	of	pot	,	but	a	pot	in	a	meadow	.
But	you	can	also	have	this	great	community	of	city	or	building-top	beekeepers	,	these	beekeepers	that	live	--	This	is	in	Paris	where	these	beekeepers	live	.
And	everyone	should	open	a	beehive	,	because	it	is	the	most	amazing	,	incredible	thing	.
And	if	we	want	to	cure	ourselves	of	NDD	,	or	Nature	Deficit	Disorder	,	I	think	this	is	a	great	way	of	doing	it	.
Get	a	beehive	and	grow	a	meadow	,	and	watch	that	life	come	back	into	your	life	.
And	so	with	that	,	I	think	that	what	we	can	do	,	if	we	do	this	,	we	can	make	sure	that	our	future	--	our	more	perfect	future	--	includes	beekeepers	and	it	includes	bees	and	it	includes	those	meadows	.
And	that	journey	--	that	journey	of	transformation	that	occurs	as	you	grow	your	meadow	and	as	you	keep	your	bees	or	you	watch	those	native	bees	there	--	is	an	extremely	exciting	one	.
And	I	hope	that	you	experience	it	and	I	hope	you	tell	me	about	it	one	day	.
So	thank	you	very	much	for	being	here	.	Thank	you	very	much	.
Thank	you	.	Thank	you	very	much	.
That	was	whistling	.
I	'm	trying	to	do	this	in	English	.
What	is	a	chubby	,	curly-haired	guy	from	Holland	--	why	is	he	whistling	?
Well	actually	,	I	've	[	been	]	whistling	since	the	age	of	four	,	about	four	.
My	dad	was	always	whistling	around	the	house	,	and	I	just	thought	that	's	part	of	communication	in	my	family	.
So	I	whistled	along	with	him	.
And	actually	,	till	I	was	34	,	I	always	annoyed	and	irritated	people	with	whistling	,
because	,	to	be	honest	,	my	whistling	is	a	kind	of	deviant	behavior	.
I	whistled	alone	.	I	whistled	in	the	classroom	.	I	whistled	on	[	my	]	bike	.	I	whistled	everywhere	.
And	I	also	whistled	at	a	Christmas	Eve	party	with	my	family-in-law	.
And	they	had	some	,	in	my	opinion	,	terrible	Christmas	music	.
And	when	I	hear	music	that	I	do	n't	like	,	I	try	to	make	it	better	.
So	``	Rudolph	the	Red-Nosed	Reindeer	''	--	you	know	it	?
But	it	can	also	sound	like	this	.
But	during	a	Christmas	party	--	at	dinner	actually	--	it	's	very	annoying	.
So	my	sister-in-law	asked	me	a	few	times	,	``	Please	stop	whistling	.	''
And	I	just	could	n't	.
And	at	one	point	--	and	I	had	some	wine	,	I	have	to	admit	that	--	at	one	point	I	said	,	``	If	there	was	a	contest	,	I	would	join	.	''
And	two	weeks	later	I	received	a	text	message	:	``	You	're	going	to	America	.	''
So	,	okay	,	I	'm	going	to	America	.
I	would	love	to	,	but	why	?
So	I	immediately	called	her	up	,	of	course	.
She	Googled	,	and	she	found	this	World	Whistling	Championship	in	America	,	of	course	.
She	did	n't	expect	me	to	go	there	.
And	I	would	have	lost	my	face	.
I	do	n't	know	if	that	's	correct	English	.
But	the	Dutch	people	here	will	understand	what	I	mean	.
I	lost	my	face	.
And	she	thought	,	``	He	will	never	go	there	.	''
But	actually	I	did	.
So	I	went	to	Louisburg	,	North	Carolina	,	southeast	United	States	,
and	I	entered	the	world	of	whistling	.
And	I	also	entered	the	world	championship	,	and	I	won	there	in	2004	.
That	was	great	fun	,	of	course	.
And	to	defend	my	title	--	like	judokas	do	and	sportsmen	--	I	thought	,	well	let	's	go	back	in	2005	,	and	I	won	again	.
Then	I	could	n't	participate	for	a	few	years	.
And	in	2008	I	entered	again	in	Japan	,	Tokyo	,	and	I	won	again	.
So	what	happened	now	is	I	'm	standing	here	in	Rotterdam	,	in	the	beautiful	city	,	on	a	big	stage	,	and	I	'm	talking	about	whistling	.
And	actually	I	earn	my	money	whistling	at	the	moment	.
So	I	quit	my	day	job	as	a	nurse	.
And	I	try	to	live	my	dream	--	well	,	actually	,	it	was	never	my	dream	,	but	it	sounds	so	good	.
Okay	,	I	'm	not	the	only	one	whistling	here	.
You	say	,	``	Huh	,	what	do	you	mean	?	''
Well	actually	,	you	are	going	to	whistle	along	.
And	then	always	the	same	thing	happens	:	people	are	watching	each	other	and	think	,	``	Oh	,	my	God	.
Why	?	Can	I	go	away	?	''
No	,	you	ca	n't	.
Actually	it	's	very	simple	.
The	track	that	I	will	whistle	is	called	``	Fête	de	la	Belle	.	''
It	's	about	80	minutes	long	.
No	,	no	,	no	.	It	's	four	minutes	long	.
And	I	want	to	first	rehearse	with	you	your	whistling	.
So	I	whistle	the	tone	.
Sorry	.	I	forgot	one	thing	.
You	whistle	the	same	tone	as	me	.
I	heard	a	wide	variety	of	tones	.
This	is	very	promising	.
This	is	very	promising	.
I	'll	ask	the	technicians	to	start	the	music	.
And	if	it	's	started	,	I	just	point	where	you	whistle	along	,
and	we	will	see	what	happens	.
Oh	,	hah	.
I	'm	so	sorry	,	technicians	.
I	'm	so	used	to	that	.
I	start	it	myself	.
Okay	,	here	it	is	.
Okay	.	It	's	easy	,	is	n't	it	?
Now	comes	the	solo	.	I	propose	I	do	that	myself	.
Max	Westerman	:	Geert	Chatrou	,	the	World	Champion	[	of	]	Whistling	.
Sometimes	I	go	browsing	[	through	]	a	very	old	magazine	.
I	found	this	observation	test	about	the	story	of	the	ark	.
And	the	artist	that	drew	this	observation	test	did	some	errors	,	had	some	mistakes	--
there	are	more	or	less	12	mistakes	.
Some	of	them	are	very	easy	.
There	is	a	funnel	,	an	aerial	part	,	a	lamp	and	clockwork	key	on	the	ark	.
Some	of	them	are	about	the	animals	,	the	number	.
But	there	is	a	much	more	fundamental	mistake	in	the	overall	story	of	the	ark	that	's	not	reported	here	.
And	this	problem	is	:	where	are	the	plants	?
So	now	we	have	God	that	is	going	to	submerge	Earth	permanently	or	at	least	for	a	very	long	period	,	and	no	one	is	taking	care	of	plants	.
Noah	needed	to	take	two	of	every	kind	of	bird	,	of	every	kind	of	animal	,	of	every	kind	of	creature	that	moves	,	but	no	mention	about	plants	.
Why	?
In	another	part	of	the	same	story	,	all	the	living	creatures	are	just	the	living	creatures	that	came	out	from	the	ark	,	so	birds	,	livestock	and	wild	animals	.
Plants	are	not	living	creatures	--
this	is	the	point	.
That	is	a	point	that	is	not	coming	out	from	the	Bible	,	but	it	's	something	that	really	accompanied	humanity	.
Let	's	have	a	look	at	this	nice	code	that	is	coming	from	a	Renaissance	book	.
Here	we	have	the	description	of	the	order	of	nature	.
It	's	a	nice	description	because	it	's	starting	from	left	--	you	have	the	stones	--	immediately	after	the	stones	,	the	plants	that	are	just	able	to	live	.
We	have	the	animals	that	are	able	to	live	and	to	sense	,	and	on	the	top	of	the	pyramid	,	there	is	the	man	.
This	is	not	the	common	man	.
The	``	Homo	studiosus	''	--	the	studying	man	.
This	is	quite	comforting	for	people	like	me	--	I	'm	a	professor	--	this	to	be	over	there	on	the	top	of	creation	.
But	it	's	something	completely	wrong	.
You	know	very	well	about	professors	.
But	it	's	also	wrong	about	plants	,	because	plants	are	not	just	able	to	live	;
they	are	able	to	sense	.
They	are	much	more	sophisticated	in	sensing	than	animals	.
Just	to	give	you	an	example	,	every	single	root	apex	is	able	to	detect	and	to	monitor	concurrently	and	continuously	at	least	15	different	chemical	and	physical	parameters	.
And	they	also	are	able	to	show	and	to	exhibit	such	a	wonderful	and	complex	behavior	that	can	be	described	just	with	the	term	of	intelligence	.
Well	,	but	this	is	something	--	this	underestimation	of	plants	is	something	that	is	always	with	us	.
Let	's	have	a	look	at	this	short	movie	now	.
We	have	David	Attenborough	.
Now	David	Attenborough	is	really	a	plant	lover	;
he	did	some	of	the	most	beautiful	movies	about	plant	behavior	.
Now	,	when	he	speaks	about	plants	,	everything	is	correct	.
When	he	speaks	about	animals	,	[	he	]	tends	to	remove	the	fact	that	plants	exist	.
The	blue	whale	,	the	biggest	creature	that	exists	on	the	planet	--
that	is	wrong	,	completely	wrong	.
The	blue	whale	,	it	's	a	dwarf	if	compared	with	the	real	biggest	creature	that	exists	on	the	planet	--	that	is	,	this	wonderful	,	magnificent	Sequoiadendron	giganteum	.
And	this	is	a	living	organism	that	has	a	mass	of	at	least	2,000	tons	.
Now	,	the	story	that	plants	are	some	low-level	organisms	has	been	formalized	many	times	ago	by	Aristotle	,	that	in	``	De	Anima	''	--	that	is	a	very	influential	book	for	the	Western	civilization	--	wrote	that	the	plants	are	on	the	edge	between	living	and	not	living	.
They	have	just	a	kind	of	very	low-level	soul	.
It	's	called	the	vegetative	soul	,	because	they	lack	movement	,	and	so	they	do	n't	need	to	sense	.
Let	's	see	.
Okay	,	some	of	the	movements	of	the	plants	are	very	well-known	.
This	is	a	very	fast	movement	.
This	is	a	Dionaea	,	a	Venus	fly	trap	hunting	snails	--
sorry	for	the	snail	.
This	has	been	something	that	has	been	refused	for	centuries	,	despite	the	evidence	.
No	one	can	say	that	the	plants	were	able	to	eat	an	animal	,	because	it	was	against	the	order	of	nature	.
But	plants	are	also	able	to	show	a	lot	of	movement	.
Some	of	them	are	very	well	known	,	like	the	flowering	.
It	's	just	a	question	to	use	some	techniques	like	the	time	lapse	.
Some	of	them	are	much	more	sophisticated	.
Look	at	this	young	bean	that	is	moving	to	catch	the	light	every	time	.
And	it	's	really	so	graceful	;
it	's	like	a	dancing	angel	.
They	are	also	able	to	play	--
they	are	really	playing	.
These	are	young	sunflowers	,	and	what	they	are	doing	can	not	be	described	with	any	other	terms	than	playing	.
They	are	training	themselves	,	as	many	young	animals	do	,	to	the	adult	life	where	they	will	be	called	to	track	the	sun	all	the	day	.
They	are	able	to	respond	to	gravity	,	of	course	,	so	the	shoots	are	growing	against	the	vector	of	gravity	and	the	roots	toward	the	vector	of	gravity	.
But	they	are	also	able	to	sleep	.
This	is	one	,	Mimosa	pudica	.
So	during	the	night	,	they	curl	the	leaves	and	reduce	the	movement	,	and	during	the	day	,	you	have	the	opening	of	the	leaves	--	there	is	much	more	movement	.
This	is	interesting	because	this	sleeping	machinery	,	it	's	perfectly	conserved	.
It	's	the	same	in	plants	,	in	insects	and	in	animals	.
And	so	if	you	need	to	study	this	sleeping	problem	,	it	's	easy	to	study	on	plants	,	for	example	,	than	in	animals	and	it	's	much	more	easy	even	ethically	.
It	's	a	kind	of	vegetarian	experimentation	.
Plants	are	even	able	to	communicate	--
they	are	extraordinary	communicators	.
They	communicate	with	other	plants	.
They	are	able	to	distinguish	kin	and	non-kin	.
They	communicate	with	plants	of	other	species	and	they	communicate	with	animals	by	producing	chemical	volatiles	,	for	example	,	during	the	pollination	.
Now	with	the	pollination	,	it	's	a	very	serious	issue	for	plants	,	because	they	move	the	pollen	from	one	flower	to	the	other	,	yet	they	can	not	move	from	one	flower	to	the	other	.
So	they	need	a	vector	--	and	this	vector	,	it	's	normally	an	animal	.
Many	insects	have	been	used	by	plants	as	vectors	for	the	transport	of	the	pollination	,	but	not	just	insects	;	even	birds	,	reptiles	,	and	mammals	like	bats	rats	are	normally	used	for	the	transportation	of	the	pollen	.
This	is	a	serious	business	.
We	have	the	plants	that	are	giving	to	the	animals	a	kind	of	sweet	substance	--	very	energizing	--	having	in	change	this	transportation	of	the	pollen	.
But	some	plants	are	manipulating	animals	,	like	in	the	case	of	orchids	that	promise	sex	and	nectar	and	give	in	change	nothing	for	the	transportation	of	the	pollen	.
Now	,	there	is	a	big	problem	behind	all	this	behavior	that	we	have	seen	.
How	is	it	possible	to	do	this	without	a	brain	?
We	need	to	wait	until	1880	,	when	this	big	man	,	Charles	Darwin	,	publishes	a	wonderful	,	astonishing	book	that	starts	a	revolution	.
The	title	is	``	The	Power	of	Movement	in	Plants	.	''
No	one	was	allowed	to	speak	about	movement	in	plants	before	Charles	Darwin	.
In	his	book	,	assisted	by	his	son	,	Francis	--	who	was	the	first	professor	of	plant	physiology	in	the	world	,	in	Cambridge	--	they	took	into	consideration	every	single	movement	for	500	pages	.
And	in	the	last	paragraph	of	the	book	,	it	's	a	kind	of	stylistic	mark	,	because	normally	Charles	Darwin	stored	,	in	the	last	paragraph	of	a	book	,	the	most	important	message	.
He	wrote	that	,	``	It	's	hardly	an	exaggeration	to	say	that	the	tip	of	the	radical	acts	like	the	brain	of	one	of	the	lower	animals	.	''
This	is	not	a	metaphor	.
He	wrote	some	very	interesting	letters	to	one	of	his	friends	who	was	J.D	.	Hooker	,	or	at	that	time	,	president	of	the	Royal	Society	,	so	the	maximum	scientific	authority	in	Britain	speaking	about	the	brain	in	the	plants	.
Now	,	this	is	a	root	apex	growing	against	a	slope	.
So	you	can	recognize	this	kind	of	movement	,	the	same	movement	that	worms	,	snakes	and	every	animal	that	are	moving	on	the	ground	without	legs	is	able	to	display	.
And	it	's	not	an	easy	movement	because	,	to	have	this	kind	of	movement	,	you	need	to	move	different	regions	of	the	root	and	to	synchronize	these	different	regions	without	having	a	brain	.
So	we	studied	the	root	apex	and	we	found	that	there	is	a	specific	region	that	is	here	,	depicted	in	blue	--	that	is	called	the	``	transition	zone	.	''
And	this	region	,	it	's	a	very	small	region	--
it	's	less	than	one	millimeter	.
And	in	this	small	region	you	have	the	highest	consumption	of	oxygen	in	the	plants	and	more	important	,	you	have	these	kinds	of	signals	here	.
The	signals	that	you	are	seeing	here	are	action	potential	,	are	the	same	signals	that	the	neurons	of	my	brain	,	of	our	brain	,	use	to	exchange	information	.
Now	we	know	that	a	root	apex	has	just	a	few	hundred	cells	that	show	this	kind	of	feature	,	but	we	know	how	big	the	root	apparatus	of	a	small	plant	,	like	a	plant	of	rye	.
We	have	almost	14	million	roots	.
We	have	11	and	a	half	million	root	apex	and	a	total	length	of	600	or	more	kilometers	and	a	very	high	surface	area	.
Now	let	's	imagine	that	each	single	root	apex	is	working	in	network	with	all	the	others	.
Here	were	have	on	the	left	,	the	Internet	and	on	the	right	,	the	root	apparatus	.
They	work	in	the	same	way	.
They	are	a	network	of	small	computing	machines	,	working	in	networks	.
And	why	are	they	so	similar	?
Because	they	evolved	for	the	same	reason	:	to	survive	predation	.
They	work	in	the	same	way	.
So	you	can	remove	90	percent	of	the	root	apparatus	and	the	plants	[	continue	]	to	work	.
You	can	remove	90	percent	of	the	Internet	and	it	is	[	continuing	]	to	work	.
So	,	a	suggestion	for	the	people	working	with	networks	:	plants	are	able	to	give	you	good	suggestions	about	how	to	evolve	networks	.
And	another	possibility	is	a	technological	possibility	.
Let	's	imagine	that	we	can	build	robots	and	robots	that	are	inspired	by	plants	.
Until	now	,	the	man	was	inspired	just	by	man	or	the	animals	in	producing	a	robot	.
We	have	the	animaloid	--	and	the	normal	robots	inspired	by	animals	,	insectoid	,	so	on	.
We	have	the	androids	that	are	inspired	by	man	.
But	why	have	we	not	any	plantoid	?
Well	,	if	you	want	to	fly	,	it	's	good	that	you	look	at	birds	--	to	be	inspired	by	birds	.
But	if	you	want	to	explore	soils	,	or	if	you	want	to	colonize	new	territory	,	to	best	thing	that	you	can	do	is	to	be	inspired	by	plants	that	are	masters	in	doing	this	.
We	have	another	possibility	we	are	working	[	on	]	in	our	lab	,	[	which	]	is	to	build	hybrids	.
It	's	much	more	easy	to	build	hybrids	.
Hybrid	means	it	's	something	that	's	half	living	and	half	machine	.
It	's	much	more	easy	to	work	with	plants	than	with	animals	.
They	have	computing	power	,
they	have	electrical	signals	.
The	connection	with	the	machine	is	much	more	easy	,	much	more	even	ethically	possible	.
And	these	are	three	possibilities	that	we	are	working	on	to	build	hybrids	,	driven	by	algae	or	by	the	leaves	at	the	end	,	by	the	most	,	most	powerful	parts	of	the	plants	,	by	the	roots	.
Well	,	thank	you	for	your	attention	.
And	before	I	finish	,	I	would	like	to	reassure	that	no	snails	were	harmed	in	making	this	presentation	.
I	started	Improv	Everywhere	about	10	years	ago	when	I	moved	to	New	York	City	with	an	interest	in	acting	and	comedy	.
Because	I	was	new	to	the	city	,	I	did	n't	have	access	to	a	stage	,	so	I	decided	to	create	my	own	in	public	places	.
So	the	first	project	we	're	going	to	take	a	look	at	is	the	very	first	No	Pants	Subway	Ride	.	Now	this	took	place	in	January	of	2002	.
And	this	woman	is	the	star	of	the	video	.
She	does	n't	know	she	's	being	filmed	.
She	's	being	filmed	with	a	hidden	camera	.
This	is	on	the	6	train	in	New	York	City	.
And	this	is	the	first	stop	along	the	line	.
These	are	two	Danish	guys	who	come	out	and	sit	down	next	to	the	hidden	camera	.
And	that	's	me	right	there	in	a	brown	coat	.
It	's	about	30	degrees	outside	.
I	'm	wearing	a	hat	.	I	'm	wearing	a	scarf	.
And	the	girl	's	going	to	notice	me	right	here	.
And	as	you	'll	see	now	,	I	'm	not	wearing	pants	.
So	at	this	point	--	at	this	point	she	's	noticed	me	,	but	in	New	York	there	's	weirdos	on	any	given	train	car	.
One	person	's	not	that	unusual	.
She	goes	back	to	reading	her	book	,	which	is	unfortunately	titled	``	Rape	.	''
So	she	's	noticed	the	unusual	thing	,	but	she	's	gone	back	to	her	normal	life	.
Now	in	the	meantime	,	I	have	six	friends	who	are	waiting	at	the	next	six	consecutive	stops	in	their	underwear	as	well	.
They	're	going	to	be	entering	this	car	one	by	one	.
We	'll	act	as	though	we	do	n't	know	each	other	.
And	we	'll	act	as	if	it	's	just	an	unfortunate	mistake	we	've	made	,	forgetting	our	pants	on	this	cold	January	day	.
So	at	this	point	,	she	decides	to	put	the	rape	book	away	.
And	she	decides	to	be	a	little	bit	more	aware	of	her	surroundings	.
Now	in	the	meantime	,	the	two	Danish	guys	to	the	left	of	the	camera	,	they	're	cracking	up	.
They	think	this	is	the	funniest	thing	they	've	ever	seen	before	.
And	watch	her	make	eye	contact	with	them	right	about	now	.
And	I	love	that	moment	in	this	video	,	because	before	it	became	a	shared	experience	,	it	was	something	that	was	maybe	a	little	bit	scary	,	or	something	that	was	at	least	confusing	to	her	.
And	then	once	it	became	a	shared	experience	,	it	was	funny	and	something	that	she	could	laugh	at	.
So	the	train	is	now	pulling	into	the	third	stop	along	the	6	line	.
So	the	video	wo	n't	show	everything	.
This	goes	on	for	another	four	stops	.
A	total	of	seven	guys	enter	anonymously	in	their	underwear	.
At	the	eighth	stop	,	a	girl	came	in	with	a	giant	duffel	bag	and	announced	she	had	pants	for	sale	for	a	dollar	--	like	you	might	sell	batteries	or	candy	on	the	train	.
We	all	very	matter	of	factly	bought	a	pair	of	pants	,	put	them	on	and	said	,	``	Thank	you	.	That	's	exactly	what	I	needed	today	,	''	and	then	exited	without	revealing	what	had	happened	and	went	in	all	different	directions	.
Thank	you	.
So	that	's	a	still	from	the	video	there	.
And	I	love	that	girl	's	reaction	so	much	.
And	watching	that	videotape	later	that	day	inspired	me	to	keep	doing	what	I	do	.
And	really	one	of	the	points	of	Improv	Everywhere	is	to	cause	a	scene	in	a	public	place	that	is	a	positive	experience	for	other	people	.
It	's	a	prank	,	but	it	's	a	prank	that	gives	somebody	a	great	story	to	tell	.
And	her	reaction	inspired	me	to	do	a	second	annual	No	Pants	Subway	Ride	.
And	we	've	continued	to	do	it	every	year	.
This	January	,	we	did	the	10th	annual	No	Pants	Subway	Ride	where	a	diverse	group	of	3,500	people	rode	the	train	in	their	underwear	in	New	York	--	almost	every	single	train	line	in	the	city	.
And	also	in	50	other	cities	around	the	world	,	people	participated	.
As	I	started	taking	improv	class	at	the	Upright	Citizens	Brigade	Theater	and	meeting	other	creative	people	and	other	performers	and	comedians	,	I	started	amassing	a	mailing	list	of	people	who	wanted	to	do	these	types	of	projects	.
So	I	could	do	more	large-scale	projects	.
Well	one	day	I	was	walking	through	Union	Square	,	and	I	saw	this	building	,	which	had	just	been	built	in	2005	.
And	there	was	a	girl	in	one	of	the	windows	and	she	was	dancing	.
And	it	was	very	peculiar	,	because	it	was	dark	out	,	but	she	was	back-lit	with	florescent	lighting	,	and	she	was	very	much	onstage	,	and	I	could	n't	figure	out	why	she	was	doing	it	.
After	about	15	seconds	,	her	friend	appeared	--	she	had	been	hiding	behind	a	display	--	and	they	laughed	and	hugged	each	other	and	ran	away	.
So	it	seemed	like	maybe	she	had	been	dared	to	do	this	.
So	I	got	inspired	by	that	.
Looking	at	the	entire	facade	--	there	were	70	total	windows	--	and	I	knew	what	I	had	to	do	.
So	this	project	is	called	Look	Up	More	.	We	had	70	actors	dress	in	black	.
This	was	completely	unauthorized	.
We	did	n't	let	the	stores	know	we	were	coming	.
And	I	stood	in	the	park	giving	signals	.
The	first	signal	was	for	everybody	to	hold	up	these	four-foot	tall	letters	that	spelled	out	``	Look	Up	More	,	''	the	name	of	the	project	.
The	second	signal	was	for	everybody	to	do	Jumping	jacks	together	.
You	'll	see	that	start	right	here	.
And	then	we	had	dancing	.	We	had	everyone	dance	.
And	then	we	had	dance	solos	where	only	one	person	would	dance	and	everybody	would	point	to	them	.
So	then	I	gave	a	new	hand	signal	,	which	signaled	the	next	soloist	down	below	in	Forever	21	,	and	he	danced	.
There	were	several	other	activities	.
We	had	people	jumping	up	and	down	,	people	dropping	to	the	ground	.
And	I	was	standing	just	anonymously	in	a	sweatshirt	,	putting	my	hand	on	and	off	of	a	trashcan	to	signal	the	advancement	.
And	because	it	was	in	Union	Square	Park	,	right	by	a	subway	station	,	there	were	hundreds	of	people	by	the	end	who	stopped	and	looked	up	and	watched	what	we	were	doing	.
There	's	a	better	photo	of	it	.
So	that	particular	event	was	inspired	by	a	moment	that	I	happened	to	stumble	upon	.
The	next	project	I	want	to	show	was	given	to	me	in	an	email	from	a	stranger	.
A	high	school	kid	in	Texas	wrote	me	in	2006	and	said	,	``	You	should	get	as	many	people	as	possible	to	put	on	blue	polo	shirts	and	khaki	pants	and	go	into	a	Best	Buy	and	stand	around	.	''
So	I	wrote	this	high	school	kid	back	immediately	,	and	I	said	,	``	Yes	,	you	are	correct	.
I	think	I	'll	try	to	do	that	this	weekend	.	Thank	you	.	''
So	here	's	the	video	.
So	again	,	this	is	2005	.
This	is	the	Best	Buy	in	New	York	City	.
We	had	about	80	people	show	up	to	participate	,	entering	one-by-one	.
There	was	an	eight	year-old	girl	,	a	10	year-old	girl	.
There	was	also	a	65	year-old	man	who	participated	.
So	a	very	diverse	group	of	people	.
And	I	told	people	,	``	Do	n't	work	.	Do	n't	actually	do	work	.
But	also	,	do	n't	shop	.
Just	stand	around	and	do	n't	face	products	.	''
Now	you	can	see	the	regular	employees	by	the	ones	that	have	the	yellow	tags	on	their	shirt	.
Everybody	else	is	one	of	our	actors	.
The	lower	level	employees	thought	it	was	very	funny	.
And	in	fact	,	several	of	them	went	to	go	get	their	camera	from	the	break	room	and	took	photos	with	us	.
A	lot	of	them	made	jokes	about	trying	to	get	us	to	go	to	the	back	to	get	heavy	television	sets	for	customers	.
The	managers	and	the	security	guards	,	on	the	other	hand	,	did	not	find	it	particularly	funny	.
You	can	see	them	in	this	footage	.
They	're	wearing	either	a	yellow	shirt	or	a	black	shirt	.
And	we	were	there	probably	10	minutes	before	the	managers	decided	to	dial	911	.
So	they	started	running	around	telling	everybody	the	cops	were	coming	,	watch	out	,	the	cops	were	coming	.
And	you	can	see	the	cops	in	this	footage	right	here	.
That	's	a	cop	wearing	black	right	there	,	being	filmed	with	a	hidden	camera	.
Ultimately	,	the	police	had	to	inform	Best	Buy	management	that	it	was	not	,	in	fact	,	illegal	to	wear	a	blue	polo	shirt	and	khaki	pants	.
Thank	you	.
So	we	had	been	there	for	20	minutes	;	we	were	happy	to	exit	the	store	.
One	thing	the	managers	were	trying	to	do	was	to	track	down	our	cameras	.
And	they	caught	a	couple	of	my	guys	who	had	hidden	cameras	in	duffel	bags	.
But	the	one	camera	guy	they	never	caught	was	the	guy	that	went	in	just	with	a	blank	tape	and	went	over	to	the	Best	Buy	camera	department	and	just	put	his	tape	in	one	of	their	cameras	and	pretended	to	shop	.
So	I	like	that	concept	of	using	their	own	technology	against	them	.
I	think	our	best	projects	are	ones	that	are	site	specific	and	happen	at	a	particular	place	for	a	reason	.
And	one	morning	,	I	was	riding	the	subway	.	I	had	to	make	a	transfer	at	the	53rd	St.	stop	where	there	are	these	two	giant	escalators	.
And	it	's	a	very	depressing	place	to	be	in	the	morning	,	it	's	very	crowded	.
So	I	decided	to	try	and	stage	something	that	could	make	it	as	happy	as	possible	for	one	morning	.
So	this	was	in	the	winter	of	2009	--	8:30	in	the	morning	.
It	's	morning	rush	hour	.
It	's	very	cold	outside	.
People	are	coming	in	from	Queens	,	transferring	from	the	E	train	to	the	6	train	.
And	they	're	going	up	these	giant	escalators	on	their	way	to	their	jobs	.
Thank	you	.	So	there	's	a	photograph	that	illustrates	it	a	little	bit	better	.
He	gave	2,000	high	fives	that	day	,	and	he	washed	his	hands	before	and	afterward	and	did	not	get	sick	.
And	that	was	done	also	without	permission	,	although	no	one	seemed	to	care	.
So	I	'd	say	over	the	years	,	one	of	the	most	common	criticisms	I	see	of	Improv	Everywhere	left	anonymously	on	YouTube	comments	is	:	``	These	people	have	too	much	time	on	their	hands	.	''
And	you	know	,	not	everybody	's	going	to	like	everything	you	do	,	and	I	've	certainly	developed	a	thick	skin	thanks	to	Internet	comments	,	but	that	one	's	always	bothered	me	,	because	we	do	n't	have	too	much	time	on	our	hands	.
The	participants	at	Improv	Everywhere	events	have	just	as	much	leisure	time	as	any	other	New	Yorkers	,	they	just	occasionally	choose	to	spend	it	in	an	unusual	way	.
You	know	,	every	Saturday	and	Sunday	,	hundreds	of	thousands	of	people	each	fall	gather	in	football	stadiums	to	watch	games	.
And	I	've	never	seen	anybody	comment	,	looking	at	a	football	game	,	saying	,	``	All	those	people	in	the	stands	,	they	have	too	much	time	on	their	hands	.	''	And	of	course	they	do	n't	.
It	's	a	perfectly	wonderful	way	to	spent	a	weekend	afternoon	,	watching	a	football	game	in	a	stadium	.
But	I	think	it	's	also	a	perfectly	valid	way	to	spend	an	afternoon	freezing	in	place	with	200	people	in	the	Grand	Central	terminal	or	dressing	up	like	a	ghostbuster	and	running	through	the	New	York	Public	Library	.
Or	listening	to	the	same	MP3	as	3,000	other	people	and	dancing	silently	in	a	park	,	or	bursting	into	song	in	a	grocery	store	as	part	of	a	spontaneous	musical	,	or	diving	into	the	ocean	in	Coney	Island	wearing	formal	attire	.
You	know	,	as	kids	,	we	're	taught	to	play	.
And	we	're	never	given	a	reason	why	we	should	play	.
It	's	just	acceptable	that	play	is	a	good	thing	.
And	I	think	that	's	sort	of	the	point	of	Improv	Everywhere	.
It	's	that	there	is	no	point	and	that	there	does	n't	have	to	be	a	point	.
We	do	n't	need	a	reason	.
As	long	as	it	's	fun	and	it	seems	like	it	's	going	to	be	a	funny	idea	and	it	seems	like	the	people	who	witness	it	will	also	have	a	fun	time	,	then	that	's	enough	for	us	.
And	I	think	,	as	adults	,	we	need	to	learn	that	there	's	no	right	or	wrong	way	to	play	.
Thank	you	very	much	.
Cholera	was	reported	in	Haiti	for	the	first	time	in	over	50	years	last	October	.
There	was	no	way	to	predict	how	far	it	would	spread	through	water	supplies	and	how	bad	the	situation	would	get	.
And	not	knowing	where	help	was	needed	always	ensured	that	help	was	in	short	supply	in	the	areas	that	needed	it	most	.
We	've	gotten	good	at	predicting	and	preparing	for	storms	before	they	take	innocent	lives	and	cause	irreversible	damage	,	but	we	still	ca	n't	do	that	with	water	,	and	here	's	why	.
Right	now	,	if	you	want	to	test	water	in	the	field	,	you	need	a	trained	technician	,	expensive	equipment	like	this	,	and	you	have	to	wait	about	a	day	for	chemical	reactions	to	take	place	and	provide	results	.
It	's	too	slow	to	get	a	picture	of	conditions	on	the	ground	before	they	change	,	too	expensive	to	implement	in	all	the	places	that	require	testing	.
And	it	ignores	the	fact	that	,	in	the	meanwhile	,	people	still	need	to	drink	water	.
Most	of	the	information	that	we	collected	on	the	cholera	outbreak	did	n't	come	from	testing	water	;	it	came	from	forms	like	this	,	which	documented	all	the	people	we	failed	to	help	.
Countless	lives	have	been	saved	by	canaries	in	coalmines	--	a	simple	and	invaluable	way	for	miners	to	know	whether	they	're	safe	.
I	've	been	inspired	by	that	simplicity	as	I	've	been	working	on	this	problem	with	some	of	the	most	hardworking	and	brilliant	people	I	've	ever	known	.
We	think	there	's	a	simpler	solution	to	this	problem	--	one	that	can	be	used	by	people	who	face	conditions	like	this	everyday	.
It	's	in	its	early	stages	,	but	this	is	what	it	looks	like	right	now	.
We	call	it	the	Water	Canary	.
It	's	a	fast	,	cheap	device	that	answers	an	important	question	:	Is	this	water	contaminated	?
It	does	n't	require	any	special	training	.
And	instead	of	waiting	for	chemical	reactions	to	take	place	,	it	uses	light	.
That	means	there	's	no	waiting	for	chemical	reactions	to	take	place	,	no	need	to	use	reagents	that	can	run	out	and	no	need	to	be	an	expert	to	get	actionable	information	.
To	test	water	,	you	simply	insert	a	sample	and	,	within	seconds	,	it	either	displays	a	red	light	,	indicating	contaminated	water	,	or	a	green	light	,	indicating	the	sample	is	safe	.
This	will	make	it	possible	for	anyone	to	collect	life-saving	information	and	to	monitor	water	quality	conditions	as	they	unfold	.
We	're	also	,	on	top	of	that	,	integrating	wireless	networking	into	an	affordable	device	with	GPS	and	GSM	.
What	that	means	is	that	each	reading	can	be	automatically	transmitted	to	servers	to	be	mapped	in	real	time	.
With	enough	users	,	maps	like	this	will	make	it	possible	to	take	preventive	action	,	containing	hazards	before	they	turn	into	emergencies	that	take	years	to	recover	from	.
And	then	,	instead	of	taking	days	to	disseminate	this	information	to	the	people	who	need	it	most	,	it	can	happen	automatically	.
We	've	seen	how	distributed	networks	,	big	data	and	information	can	transform	society	.
I	think	it	's	time	for	us	to	apply	them	to	water	.
Our	goal	over	the	next	year	is	to	get	Water	Canary	ready	for	the	field	and	to	open-source	the	hardware	so	that	anyone	can	contribute	to	the	development	and	the	evaluation	,	so	we	can	tackle	this	problem	together	.
Thank	you	.
It	's	wonderful	to	be	back	.
I	love	this	wonderful	gathering	.
And	you	must	be	wondering	,	``	What	on	Earth	?
Have	they	put	up	the	wrong	slide	?	''
No	,	no	.
Look	at	this	magnificent	beast	and	ask	the	question	--	who	designed	it	?
This	is	TED	.
This	is	Technology	,	Entertainment	,	Design	and	there	's	a	dairy	cow	.
It	's	a	quite	wonderfully	designed	animal	.
And	I	was	thinking	,	how	do	I	introduce	this	?
And	I	thought	,	well	,	maybe	that	old	doggerel	by	Joyce	Kilmer	,	you	know	:	``	Poems	are	made	by	fools	like	me	,	but	only	God	can	make	a	tree	.	''
And	you	might	say	,	``	Well	,	God	designed	the	cow	.	''
But	,	of	course	,	God	got	a	lot	of	help	.
This	is	the	ancestor	of	cattle	.
This	is	the	Oryx	.
And	it	was	designed	by	natural	selection	,	the	process	of	natural	selection	,	over	many	millions	of	years	.
And	then	it	became	domesticated	thousands	of	years	ago	.
And	human	beings	became	its	stewards	,
and	,	without	even	knowing	what	they	were	doing	,	they	gradually	redesigned	it	and	redesigned	it	and	redesigned	it	.
And	then	,	more	recently	,	they	really	began	to	do	sort	of	reverse	engineering	on	this	beast	and	figure	out	just	what	the	parts	were	,	how	they	worked	and	how	they	might	be	optimized	--	how	they	might	be	made	better	.
Now	why	am	I	talking	about	cows	?
Because	I	want	to	say	that	much	the	same	thing	is	true	of	religions	.
Religions	are	natural	phenomena	.
They	're	just	as	natural	as	cows	.
They	have	evolved	over	millennia	.
They	have	a	biological	base	,	just	like	the	Oryx	.
They	have	become	domesticated	,	and	human	beings	have	been	redesigning	their	religions	for	thousands	of	years	.
This	is	TED	,	and	I	want	to	talk	about	design	.
Because	what	I	've	been	doing	for	the	last	four	years	,	really	since	the	first	time	you	saw	me	--	some	of	you	saw	me	at	TED	when	I	was	talking	about	religion	,	and	in	the	last	four	years	I	've	been	working	just	about	non-stop	on	this	topic	.
And	you	might	say	it	's	about	the	reverse	engineering	of	religions	.	Now	that	very	idea	,	I	think	,	strikes	terror	in	many	people	,	or	anger	,	or	anxiety	of	one	sort	or	another	.
And	that	is	the	spell	that	I	want	to	break	.
I	want	to	say	,	no	,	religions	are	an	important	natural	phenomenon	.
We	should	study	them	with	the	same	intensity	that	we	study	all	the	other	important	natural	phenomena	,	like	global	warming	,	as	we	heard	so	eloquently	last	night	from	Al	Gore	.
Today	's	religions	are	brilliantly	designed	--	brilliantly	designed	.
They	're	immensely	powerful	social	institutions	and	many	of	their	features	can	be	traced	back	to	earlier	features	that	we	can	really	make	sense	of	by	reverse	engineering	.
And	,	as	with	the	cow	,	there	's	a	mixture	of	evolutionary	design	,	designed	by	natural	selection	itself	,	and	intelligent	design	--	more	or	less	intelligent	design	--	and	redesigned	by	human	beings	who	are	trying	to	redesign	their	religions	.
You	do	n't	do	book	talks	at	TED	,	but	I	'm	going	to	have	just	one	slide	about	my	book	,	because	there	is	one	message	in	it	which	I	think	this	group	really	needs	to	hear	.
And	I	would	be	very	interested	to	get	your	responses	to	this	.
It	's	the	one	policy	proposal	that	I	make	in	the	book	,	at	this	time	when	I	claim	not	to	know	enough	about	religion	to	know	what	other	policy	proposals	to	make	.
And	it	's	one	that	echoes	remarks	that	you	've	heard	already	today	.
Here	's	my	proposal	.
I	'm	going	to	just	take	a	couple	of	minutes	to	explain	it	--	education	in	world	religions	,	on	world	religions	,	for	all	of	our	children	in	primary	school	,	in	high	school	,	in	public	schools	,	in	private	schools	and	in	home	schooling	.
So	what	I	'm	proposing	is	,	just	as	we	require	reading	,	writing	,	arithmetic	,	American	history	,	so	we	should	have	a	curriculum	on	facts	about	all	the	religions	of	the	world	--	about	their	history	,	about	their	creeds	,	about	their	texts	,	their	music	,	their	symbolisms	,	their	prohibitions	,	their	requirements	.	And	this	should	be	presented	factually	,	straightforwardly	,	with	no	particular	spin	,	to	all	of	the	children	in	the	country	.
And	as	long	as	you	teach	them	that	,	you	can	teach	them	anything	else	you	like	.
That	,	I	think	,	is	maximal	tolerance	for	religious	freedom	.
As	long	as	you	inform	your	children	about	other	religions	,	then	you	may	--	and	as	early	as	you	like	and	whatever	you	like	--	teach	them	whatever	creed	you	want	them	to	learn	.
But	also	let	them	know	about	other	religions	.
Now	why	do	I	say	that	?
Because	democracy	depends	on	an	informed	citizenship	.	Informed	consent	is	the	very	bedrock	of	our	understanding	of	democracy	.
Misinformed	consent	is	not	worth	it	.
It	's	like	a	coin	flip	;	it	does	n't	count	really	.
Democracy	depends	on	informed	consent	.
This	is	the	way	we	treat	people	as	responsible	adults	.
Now	,	children	below	the	age	of	consent	are	a	special	case	.
I	'm	going	to	use	a	word	that	Pastor	Rick	just	used	--	parents	are	stewards	of	their	children	.
They	do	n't	own	them	.
You	ca	n't	own	your	children	.
You	have	a	responsibility	to	the	world	,	to	the	state	,	to	them	,	to	take	care	of	them	right	.
You	may	teach	them	whatever	creed	you	think	is	most	important	,	but	I	say	you	have	a	responsibility	to	let	them	be	informed	about	all	the	other	creeds	in	the	world	,	too	.
The	reason	I	've	taken	this	time	is	I	've	been	fascinated	to	hear	some	of	the	reactions	to	this	.
One	reviewer	for	a	Roman	Catholic	newspaper	called	it	``	totalitarian	.	''
It	strikes	me	as	practically	libertarian	.
Is	it	totalitarian	to	require	reading	,	writing	and	arithmetic	?
I	do	n't	think	so	.
All	I	'm	saying	is	--	facts	.	Facts	only	.
No	values	,	just	facts	about	all	the	world	's	religions	.
Another	reviewer	called	it	``	hilarious	.	''
Well	,	I	'm	really	bothered	by	the	fact	that	anybody	would	think	that	was	hilarious	.
It	seems	to	me	to	be	such	a	plausible	,	natural	extension	of	the	democratic	principles	we	already	have	,	that	I	'm	shocked	to	think	anybody	would	find	that	just	ridiculous	.
I	know	many	religions	are	so	anxious	about	preserving	the	purity	of	their	faith	among	their	children	that	they	are	intent	on	keeping	their	children	ignorant	of	other	faiths	.
I	do	n't	think	that	's	defensible	,	but	I	'd	really	be	pleased	to	get	your	answers	on	that	--	any	reactions	to	that	--	later	.
But	now	I	'm	going	to	move	on	.
Back	to	the	cow	.
This	picture	,	which	I	pulled	off	the	web	--	the	fellow	on	the	left	is	really	an	important	part	of	this	picture	.
That	's	the	steward	.
Cows	could	n't	live	without	human	stewards	--	they	're	domesticated	.	They	're	a	sort	of	ectosymbiont	.
They	depend	on	us	for	their	survival	.
And	Pastor	Rick	was	just	talking	about	sheep	.
I	'm	going	to	talk	about	sheep	,	too	.
There	's	a	lot	of	serendipitous	convergence	here	.
How	clever	it	was	of	sheep	to	acquire	shepherds	!
Think	of	what	this	got	them	.
They	could	outsource	all	their	problems	--	protection	from	predators	,	food	finding	,	health	maintenance	.
The	only	cost	in	most	flocks	is	a	loss	of	free	mating	.
What	a	deal	.
``	How	clever	of	sheep	!	''	you	might	say	.
Except	,	of	course	,	it	was	n't	the	sheep	's	cleverness	.
We	all	know	sheep	are	not	exactly	rocket	scientists	--	they	're	not	very	smart	.
It	was	n't	the	cleverness	of	the	sheep	at	all	.
They	were	clueless	.
But	it	was	a	very	clever	move	.
Whose	clever	move	was	it	?
It	was	a	clever	move	of	natural	selection	itself	.
Francis	Crick	,	the	co-discoverer	of	the	structure	of	DNA	with	Jim	Watson	,	once	joked	about	what	he	called	Orgel	's	Second	Rule	.
Leslie	Orgel	is	still	a	molecular	biologist	,	brilliant	guy	,	and	Orgel	's	Second	Rule	is	:	Evolution	is	cleverer	than	you	are	.
Now	,	that	is	not	Intelligent	Design	--	not	from	Francis	Crick	.
Evolution	is	cleverer	than	you	are	.
If	you	understand	Orgel	's	Second	Rule	,	then	you	understand	why	the	Intelligent	Design	movement	is	basically	a	hoax	.
The	designs	discovered	by	the	process	of	natural	selection	are	brilliant	,	unbelievably	brilliant	.
Again	and	again	biologists	are	fascinated	with	the	brilliance	of	what	's	discovered	.
But	the	process	itself	is	without	purpose	,
without	foresight	,	without	design	.
When	I	was	here	four	years	ago	,	I	told	the	story	about	an	ant	climbing	a	blade	of	grass	.
And	why	was	the	ant	doing	it	?
Well	,	it	's	because	its	brain	had	been	infected	with	a	lancet	fluke	that	was	--	needed	to	get	into	the	belly	of	a	sheep	or	a	cow	in	order	to	reproduce	.
It	was	sort	of	a	spooky	story	.
And	I	think	some	people	may	have	misunderstood	.
Lancet	flukes	are	n't	smart	.
I	submit	that	the	intelligence	of	a	lancet	fluke	is	down	there	somewhere	between	petunia	and	carrot	.
They	're	not	really	bright	.	They	do	n't	have	to	be	.
The	lesson	we	learn	from	this	is	you	do	n't	have	to	have	a	mind	to	be	a	beneficiary	.
The	design	is	there	in	nature	,	but	it	's	not	in	anybody	's	head	.
It	does	n't	have	to	be	.
That	's	the	way	evolution	works	.
The	question	--	was	domestication	good	for	sheep	?
It	was	great	for	their	genetic	fitness	.
And	here	I	want	to	remind	you	of	a	wonderful	point	that	Paul	MacCready	made	at	TED	three	years	ago	.
Here	's	what	he	said	.
10,000	years	ago	at	the	dawn	of	agriculture	,	human	population	,	plus	livestock	and	pets	,	was	approximately	a	tenth	of	one	per	cent	of	the	terrestrial	vertebrae	landmass	.
That	was	just	10,000	years	ago	.
Yesterday	,	in	biological	terms	.
What	is	it	today	?	Does	anybody	remember	what	he	told	us	?
98	percent	.
That	is	what	we	have	done	on	this	planet	.
Now	,	I	talked	to	Paul	afterwards	.
I	wanted	to	check	to	find	out	how	he	'd	calculated	this	,
and	get	the	sources	and	so	forth	.
And	he	gave	me	a	paper	that	he	had	written	on	this	.
There	was	a	passage	in	it	which	he	did	not	present	here	and	I	think	it	is	so	good	I	'm	going	to	read	it	to	you	.
``	Over	billions	of	years	on	a	unique	sphere	,	chance	has	painted	a	thin	covering	of	life	:	complex	,	improbable	,	wonderful	and	fragile	.	Suddenly	,	we	humans	,	a	recently	arrived	species	no	longer	subject	to	the	checks	and	balances	inherent	in	nature	,	have	grown	in	population	,	technology	and	intelligence	to	a	position	of	terrible	power	.
We	now	wield	the	paintbrush	.	''
We	heard	about	the	atmosphere	as	a	thin	layer	of	varnish	.
Life	itself	is	just	a	thin	coat	of	paint	on	this	planet	.
And	we	're	the	ones	that	hold	the	paintbrush	.
And	how	can	we	do	that	?
The	key	to	our	domination	of	the	planet	is	culture	,
and	the	key	to	culture	is	religion	.
Suppose	Martian	scientists	came	to	Earth	.
They	would	be	puzzled	by	many	things	.
Anybody	know	what	this	is	?
I	'll	tell	you	what	it	is	.
This	is	a	million	people	gathering	on	the	banks	of	the	Ganges	in	2001	,	perhaps	the	largest	single	gathering	of	human	beings	ever	,	as	seen	from	satellite	photograph	.
Here	's	a	big	crowd	.
Here	's	another	crowd	in	Mecca	.
Martians	would	be	amazed	by	this	.
They	'd	want	to	know	how	it	originated	,	what	it	was	for	and	how	it	perpetuates	itself	.
Actually	,	I	'm	going	to	pass	over	this	.
The	ant	is	n't	alone	.
There	's	all	sorts	of	wonderful	cases	of	species	.
In	that	case	,	a	parasite	gets	into	a	mouse	and	it	needs	to	get	into	the	belly	of	a	cat	.
And	it	turns	the	mouse	into	Mighty	Mouse	--	it	makes	it	fearless	,	so	it	runs	out	in	the	open	,	where	it	'll	be	eaten	by	a	cat	.
True	story	.
In	other	words	,	we	have	these	hijackers	--	you	've	seen	this	slide	before	,	from	four	years	ago	--	a	parasite	that	infects	the	brain	and	induces	even	suicidal	behavior	on	behalf	of	a	cause	other	than	one	's	own	genetic	fitness	.
Does	that	ever	happen	to	us	?
Yes	,	it	does	--	quite	wonderfully	.
The	Arabic	word	``	Islam	''	means	``	submission	.	''
It	means	``	surrender	of	self-interest	to	the	will	of	Allah	.	''
But	I	'm	not	just	talking	about	Islam	.
I	'm	talking	also	about	Christianity	.
This	is	a	parchment	music	page	that	I	found	in	a	Paris	bookstall	50	years	ago	.
And	on	it	it	says	,	in	Latin	:	The	word	of	God	is	the	seed	and	the	sower	of	the	seed	is	Christ	.	''
Same	idea	!	Well	,	not	quite	.
But	in	fact	,	Christians	,	too	,	glory	in	the	fact	that	they	have	surrendered	to	God	.
I	'll	give	you	a	few	quotes	.
``	The	heart	of	worship	is	surrender	.
Surrendered	people	obey	God	's	words	,	even	if	it	does	n't	make	sense	.	''
Those	words	are	by	Rick	Warren	.
Those	are	from	``	The	Purpose	Driven	Life	.	''
And	I	want	to	turn	now	,	briefly	,	to	talk	about	that	book	,	which	I	've	read	.
You	've	all	got	a	copy	.
You	've	just	heard	the	man	.
And	what	I	want	to	do	now	is	say	a	bit	about	this	book	from	the	design	standpoint	,	because	I	think	it	's	actually	a	brilliant	book	.
First	of	all	,	the	goal	.
And	you	heard	just	now	what	the	goal	is	.
It	's	to	bring	purpose	to	the	lives	of	millions	,	and	he	has	succeeded	.
Is	it	a	good	goal	?
In	itself	,	I	'm	sure	we	all	agree	,	it	is	a	wonderful	goal	.
He	's	absolutely	right	.
There	are	lots	of	people	out	there	who	do	n't	have	purpose	in	their	life	,	and	bringing	purpose	to	their	life	is	a	wonderful	goal	.
I	give	him	an	A+	on	this	.
Is	the	goal	achieved	?
Yes	.
30	million	copies	of	this	book	.
Al	Gore	,	eat	your	heart	out	.
Just	exactly	what	Al	is	trying	to	do	,	Rick	is	doing	.
This	is	a	fantastic	achievement	.
And	,	the	means	--	how	does	he	do	it	?
It	's	a	brilliant	redesign	of	traditional	religious	themes	--	updating	them	,	quietly	dropping	obsolete	features	,	putting	new	interpretations	on	other	features	.
This	is	the	evolution	of	religion	that	's	been	going	on	for	thousands	of	years	,	and	he	's	just	the	latest	brilliant	practitioner	of	it	.
I	do	n't	have	to	tell	you	this	.	You	've	just	heard	the	man	.
Excellent	insights	into	human	psychology	,	wise	advice	on	every	page	.
Moreover	,	he	invites	us	to	look	under	the	hood	.
I	really	appreciated	that	.
For	instance	,	he	has	an	appendix	where	he	explains	his	choice	of	translations	of	different	Bible	verses	.
The	book	is	clear	,	vivid	,	accessible	,	beautifully	formatted	.
Just	enough	repetition	.
That	's	really	important	.
Every	time	you	read	it	or	say	it	,	you	make	another	copy	in	your	brain	.
Every	time	you	read	it	or	say	it	,	you	make	another	copy	in	your	brain	.
With	me	,	everybody	--	every	time	you	read	it	or	say	it	,	you	make	another	copy	in	your	brain	.
Thank	you	.
And	now	we	come	to	my	problem	.
Because	I	'm	absolutely	sincere	in	my	appreciation	of	all	that	I	've	said	about	this	book	.
But	I	wish	it	were	better	.
I	have	some	problems	with	the	book	.
And	it	would	just	be	insincere	of	me	not	to	address	those	problems	.
I	wish	he	could	do	this	with	a	revision	,	a	Mark	2	version	of	his	book	.
``	The	truth	will	set	you	free	''	--	that	's	what	it	says	in	the	Bible	,	and	it	's	something	that	I	want	to	live	by	,	too	.
My	problem	is	,	some	of	the	bits	in	it	I	do	n't	think	are	true	.
Now	some	of	this	is	a	difference	of	opinion	,	and	that	's	not	my	main	complaint	.
That	's	worth	mentioning	.
Here	's	a	passage	--	it	's	very	much	what	he	said	,	anyway	.
``	If	there	was	no	God	we	would	all	be	accidents	,	the	result	of	astronomical	random	chance	in	the	Universe	.
You	could	stop	reading	this	book	because	life	would	have	no	purpose	or	meaning	or	significance	.
There	would	be	no	right	or	wrong	and	no	hope	beyond	your	brief	years	on	Earth	.	''
Now	,	I	just	do	not	believe	that	.
By	the	way	,	I	find	Homer	Groening	's	film	presented	a	beautiful	alternative	to	that	very	claim	.
Yes	,	there	is	meaning	and	a	reason	for	right	or	wrong	.
We	do	n't	need	a	belief	in	God	to	be	good	or	to	have	meaning	in	us	.
But	that	is	just	a	difference	of	opinion	.
That	's	not	what	I	'm	really	worried	about	.
How	about	this	--	``	God	designed	this	planet	's	environment	just	so	we	could	live	in	it	.	''
I	'm	afraid	that	a	lot	of	people	take	that	sentiment	to	mean	that	we	do	n't	have	to	do	the	sorts	of	things	that	Al	Gore	is	trying	so	hard	to	get	us	to	do	.
I	'm	not	happy	with	that	sentiment	at	all	.
And	then	I	find	this	--	``	All	the	evidence	available	in	the	biological	sciences	supports	the	core	proposition	that	the	cosmos	is	especially	designed	whole	with	life	and	mankind	as	its	fundamental	goal	and	purpose	,	a	whole	in	which	all	facets	of	reality	have	their	meaning	and	explanation	in	this	central	fact	.	''
Well	,	that	's	Michael	Denton	.	He	's	a	creationist	.
And	here	I	think	,	``	Wait	a	minute	.	''
I	read	this	again	.
I	read	it	three	or	four	times	and	I	think	,	``	Is	he	really	endorsing	intelligent	design	?
Is	he	endorsing	creationism	here	?	''
And	you	ca	n't	tell	.
So	I	'm	sort	of	thinking	,	``	Well	,	I	do	n't	know	,	I	do	n't	know	if	I	want	to	get	upset	with	this	yet	.	''
But	then	I	read	on	and	I	read	this	:	``	First	,	Noah	had	never	seen	rain	,	because	prior	to	the	flood	God	irrigated	the	earth	from	the	ground	up	.	''
I	wish	that	sentence	were	n't	in	there	,	because	I	think	it	is	false	.
And	I	think	that	thinking	this	way	about	the	history	of	the	planet	,	after	we	've	just	been	hearing	about	the	history	of	the	planet	over	millions	of	years	,	discourages	people	from	scientific	understanding	.
Now	,	Rick	Warren	uses	scientific	terms	and	scientific	factoids	and	information	in	a	very	interesting	way	.
Here	's	one	:	``	God	deliberately	shaped	and	formed	you	to	serve	him	in	a	way	that	makes	your	ministry	unique	.
He	carefully	mixed	the	DNA	cocktail	that	created	you	.	''
I	think	that	's	false	.
Now	maybe	we	want	to	treat	it	as	metaphorical	.
Here	's	another	one	--	``	For	instance	,	your	brain	can	store	100	trillion	facts	.
Your	mind	can	handle	15,000	decisions	a	second	.	''
Well	,	it	would	be	interesting	to	find	the	interpretation	where	I	would	accept	that	.
There	might	be	some	way	of	treating	that	as	true	.
``	Anthropologists	have	noted	that	worship	is	a	universal	urge	,	hardwired	by	God	into	the	very	fiber	of	our	being	,	an	inbuilt	need	to	connect	with	God	.	''
Well	,	there	's	a	sense	which	I	agree	with	him	,	except	I	think	it	has	an	evolutionary	explanation	.
And	what	I	find	deeply	troubling	in	this	book	is	that	he	seems	to	be	arguing	that	if	you	want	to	be	moral	,	if	you	want	to	have	meaning	in	your	life	,	you	have	to	be	an	Intelligent	Designer	--	you	have	to	deny	the	theory	of	evolution	by	natural	selection	.
And	I	think	,	on	the	contrary	,	that	it	is	very	important	to	solving	the	world	's	problems	that	we	take	evolutionary	biology	seriously	.
Whose	truth	are	we	going	to	listen	to	?
Well	,	this	from	``	The	Purpose	Driven	Life	''	--	``	The	Bible	must	become	the	authoritative	standard	for	my	life	,	the	compass	I	rely	on	for	direction	,	the	counsel	I	listen	to	for	making	wise	decisions	and	the	benchmark	I	use	for	evaluating	everything	.	''
Well	maybe	,	OK	,	but	what	's	going	to	follow	from	this	?
And	here	's	one	that	does	concern	me	.
Remember	I	quoted	him	before	with	this	line	--	``	Surrendered	people	obey	God	's	word	,	even	if	it	does	n't	make	sense	.	''
And	that	's	a	problem	.
``	Do	n't	ever	argue	with	the	Devil	.
He	's	better	at	arguing	than	you	are	,	having	had	thousands	of	years	to	practice	.	''
Now	Rick	Warren	did	n't	invent	this	clever	move	.
It	's	an	old	move	.
It	's	a	very	clever	adaptation	of	religions	.
It	's	a	wildcard	for	disarming	any	reasonable	criticism	.
``	You	do	n't	like	my	interpretation	?
You	've	got	a	reasonable	objection	to	it	?
Do	n't	listen	,	do	n't	listen	!
That	's	the	Devil	speaking	.	''
This	discourages	the	sort	of	reasoning	citizenship	it	seems	to	me	that	we	want	to	have	.
I	've	got	one	more	problem	,	then	I	'm	through	.
And	I	'd	really	like	to	get	a	response	if	Rick	is	able	to	do	it	.
``	In	the	Great	Commission	,	Jesus	said	,	'Go	to	all	people	of	all	nations	and	make	them	my	disciples	.	Baptize	them	in	the	name	of	the	Father	,	the	Son	and	the	Holy	Spirit	,	and	teach	them	to	do	everything	I	've	told	you	.	'	''
The	Bible	says	Jesus	is	the	only	one	who	can	save	the	world	.
Now	here	we	've	seen	many	wonderful	maps	of	the	world	in	the	last	day	or	so	.
Here	's	one	,	not	as	beautiful	as	the	others	.
It	simply	shows	the	religions	of	the	world	.
And	here	's	one	that	shows	the	sort	of	current	breakdown	of	the	different	religions	.
Now	do	we	really	want	to	commit	ourselves	to	engulfing	all	the	other	religions	when	their	holy	books	are	telling	them	,	``	Do	n't	listen	to	the	other	side	,	that	's	just	Satan	talking	!	''
It	seems	to	me	that	that	's	a	very	problematic	ship	to	get	on	for	the	future	.
I	found	this	sign	as	I	was	driving	to	Maine	recently	,	in	front	of	a	church	--	``	Good	without	God	becomes	zero	.	''	Sort	of	cute	.
A	very	clever	little	meme	.
I	do	n't	believe	it	and	I	think	this	idea	,	popular	as	it	is	--	not	in	this	guise	but	in	general	--	is	itself	one	of	the	main	problems	that	we	face	.
If	you	are	like	me	,	you	know	many	wonderful	,	committed	,	engaged	atheists	,	agnostics	,	who	are	being	very	good	without	God	.
And	you	also	know	many	religious	people	who	hide	behind	their	sanctity	instead	of	doing	good	works	.
So	,	I	wish	we	could	drop	this	meme	.
I	wish	this	meme	would	go	extinct	.
Thanks	very	much	for	your	attention	.
The	Hindus	say	,	``	Nada	brahma	,	''	one	translation	of	which	is	,	``	The	world	is	sound	.	''
And	in	a	way	,	that	's	true	,	because	everything	is	vibrating	.
In	fact	,	all	of	you	as	you	sit	here	right	now	are	vibrating	.
Every	part	of	your	body	is	vibrating	at	different	frequencies	.
So	you	are	,	in	fact	,	a	chord	--	each	of	you	an	individual	chord	.
One	definition	of	health	may	be	that	that	chord	is	in	complete	harmony	.
Your	ears	ca	n't	hear	that	chord	;
they	can	actually	hear	amazing	things	.	Your	ears	can	hear	10	octaves	.
Incidentally	,	we	see	just	one	octave	.
Your	ears	are	always	on	--	you	have	no	ear	lids	.
They	work	even	when	you	sleep	.
The	smallest	sound	you	can	perceive	moves	your	eardrum	just	four	atomic	diameters	.
The	loudest	sound	you	can	hear	is	a	trillion	times	more	powerful	than	that	.
Ears	are	made	not	for	hearing	,	but	for	listening	.
Listening	is	an	active	skill	,
whereas	hearing	is	passive	,	listening	is	something	that	we	have	to	work	at	--
it	's	a	relationship	with	sound	.
And	yet	it	's	a	skill	that	none	of	us	are	taught	.
For	example	,	have	you	ever	considered	that	there	are	listening	positions	,	places	you	can	listen	from	?
Here	are	two	of	them	.
Reductive	listening	is	listening	``	for	.	''
It	reduces	everything	down	to	what	's	relevant	and	it	discards	everything	that	's	not	relevant	.
Men	typically	listen	reductively	.
So	he	's	saying	,	``	I	've	got	this	problem	.	''
He	's	saying	,	``	Here	's	your	solution	.	Thanks	very	much	.	Next	.	''
That	's	the	way	we	talk	,	right	guys	?
Expansive	listening	,	on	the	other	hand	,	is	listening	``	with	,	''	not	listening	``	for	.	''
It	's	got	no	destination	in	mind	--
it	's	just	enjoying	the	journey	.
Women	typically	listen	expansively	.	If	you	look	at	these	two	,	eye	contact	,	facing	each	other	,	possibly	both	talking	at	the	same	time	.
Men	,	if	you	get	nothing	else	out	of	this	talk	,	practice	expansive	listening	,
and	you	can	transform	your	relationships	.
The	trouble	with	listening	is	that	so	much	of	what	we	hear	is	noise	,	surrounding	us	all	the	time	.
Noise	like	this	,	according	to	the	European	Union	,	is	reducing	the	health	and	the	quality	of	life	of	25	percent	of	the	population	of	Europe	.
Two	percent	of	the	population	of	Europe	--	that	's	16	million	people	--	are	having	their	sleep	devastated	by	noise	like	that	.
Noise	kills	200,000	people	a	year	in	Europe	.
It	's	a	really	big	problem	.
Now	,	when	you	were	little	,	if	you	had	noise	and	you	did	n't	want	to	hear	it	,	you	'd	stick	your	fingers	in	your	ears	and	hum	.
These	days	,	you	can	do	a	similar	thing	,	it	just	looks	a	bit	cooler	.
It	looks	a	bit	like	this	.
The	trouble	with	widespread	headphone	use	is	it	brings	three	really	big	health	issues	.
The	first	really	big	health	issue	is	a	word	that	Murray	Schafer	coined	:	``	schizophonia	.	''
It	's	a	dislocation	between	what	you	see	and	what	you	hear	.
So	,	we	're	inviting	into	our	lives	the	voices	of	people	who	are	not	present	with	us	.
I	think	there	's	something	deeply	unhealthy	about	living	all	the	time	in	schizophonia	.
The	second	problem	that	comes	with	headphone	abuse	is	compression	.
We	squash	music	to	fit	it	into	our	pocket	and	there	is	a	cost	attached	to	this	.
Listen	to	this	--	this	is	an	uncompressed	piece	of	music	.
And	now	the	same	piece	of	music	with	98	percent	of	the	data	removed	.
I	do	hope	that	some	of	you	at	least	can	hear	the	difference	between	those	two	.
There	is	a	cost	of	compression	.
It	makes	you	tired	and	irritable	to	have	to	make	up	all	of	that	data	.
You	're	having	to	imagine	it	.
It	's	not	good	for	you	in	the	long	run	.
The	third	problem	with	headphones	is	this	:	deafness	--	noise-induced	hearing	disorder	.
Ten	million	Americans	already	have	this	for	one	reason	or	another	,	but	really	worryingly	,	16	percent	--	roughly	one	in	six	--	of	American	teenagers	suffer	from	noise-induced	hearing	disorder	as	a	result	of	headphone	abuse	.
One	study	at	an	American	university	found	that	61	percent	of	college	freshmen	had	damaged	hearing	as	a	result	of	headphone	abuse	.
We	may	be	raising	an	entire	generation	of	deaf	people	.
Now	that	's	a	really	serious	problem	.
I	'll	give	you	three	quick	tips	to	protect	your	ears	and	pass	these	on	to	your	children	,	please	.
Professional	hearing	protectors	are	great	;	I	use	some	all	the	time	.
If	you	're	going	to	use	headphones	,	buy	the	best	ones	you	can	afford	because	quality	means	you	do	n't	have	to	have	it	so	loud	.
If	you	ca	n't	hear	somebody	talking	to	you	in	a	loud	voice	,	it	's	too	loud	.
And	thirdly	,	if	you	're	in	bad	sound	,	it	's	fine	to	put	your	fingers	in	your	ears	or	just	move	away	from	it	.
Protect	your	ears	in	that	way	.
Let	's	move	away	from	bad	sound	and	look	at	some	friends	that	I	urge	you	to	seek	out	.
WWB	:	Wind	,	water	,	birds	--	stochastic	natural	sounds	composed	of	lots	of	individual	random	events	,	all	of	it	very	healthy	,	all	of	it	sound	that	we	evolved	to	over	the	years	.
Seek	those	sounds	out	;	they	're	good	for	you	and	so	it	this	.
Silence	is	beautiful	.
The	Elizabethans	described	language	as	decorated	silence	.
I	urge	you	to	move	away	from	silence	with	intention	and	to	design	soundscapes	just	like	works	of	art	.
Have	a	foreground	,	a	background	,	all	in	beautiful	proportion	.	It	's	fun	to	get	into	designing	with	sound	.
If	you	ca	n't	do	it	yourself	,	get	a	professional	to	do	it	for	you	.
Sound	design	is	the	future	,	and	I	think	it	's	the	way	we	're	going	to	change	the	way	the	world	sounds	.
I	'm	going	to	just	run	quickly	through	eight	modalities	,	eight	ways	sound	can	improve	health	.
First	,	ultrasound	:	we	're	very	familiar	with	it	from	physical	therapy	;
it	's	also	now	being	used	to	treat	cancer	.
Lithotripsy	--	saving	thousands	of	people	a	year	from	the	scalpel	by	pulverizing	stones	with	high-intensity	sound	.
Sound	healing	is	a	wonderful	modality	.
It	's	been	around	for	thousands	of	years	.
I	do	urge	you	to	explore	this	.
There	are	great	things	being	done	there	,	treating	now	autism	,	dementia	and	other	conditions	.
And	music	,	of	course	.	Just	listening	to	music	is	good	for	you	,	if	it	's	music	that	's	made	with	good	intention	,	made	with	love	,	generally	.
Devotional	music	,	good	--	Mozart	,	good	.
There	are	all	sorts	of	types	of	music	that	are	very	healthy	.
And	four	modalities	where	you	need	to	take	some	action	and	get	involved	.
First	of	all	,	listen	consciously	.
I	hope	that	that	after	this	talk	you	'll	be	doing	that	.
It	's	a	whole	new	dimension	to	your	life	and	it	's	wonderful	to	have	that	dimension	.
Secondly	,	get	in	touch	with	making	some	sound	--
create	sound	.
The	voice	is	the	instrument	we	all	play	,	and	yet	how	many	of	us	are	trained	in	using	our	voice	?	Get	trained	;
learn	to	sing	,	learn	to	play	an	instrument	.
Musicians	have	bigger	brains	--	it	's	true	.
You	can	do	this	in	groups	as	well	.
It	's	a	fantastic	antidote	to	schizophonia	;	to	make	music	and	sound	in	a	group	of	people	,	whichever	style	you	enjoy	particularly	.
And	let	's	take	a	stewarding	role	for	the	sound	around	us	.
Protect	your	ears	?	Yes	,	absolutely	.
Design	soundscapes	to	be	beautiful	around	you	at	home	and	at	work	.
And	let	's	start	to	speak	up	when	people	are	assailing	us	with	the	noise	that	I	played	you	early	on	.
So	I	'm	going	to	leave	you	with	seven	things	you	can	do	right	now	to	improve	your	health	with	sound	.
My	vision	is	of	a	world	that	sounds	beautiful	and	if	we	all	start	doing	these	things	,	we	will	take	a	very	big	step	in	that	direction	.
So	I	urge	you	to	take	that	path	.
I	'm	leaving	you	with	a	little	more	birdsong	,	which	is	very	good	for	you	.
I	wish	you	sound	health	.
I	want	to	ask	you	all	to	consider	for	a	second	the	very	simple	fact	that	,	by	far	,	most	of	what	we	know	about	the	universe	comes	to	us	from	light	.
We	can	stand	on	the	Earth	and	look	up	at	the	night	sky	and	see	stars	with	our	bare	eyes	.
The	Sun	burns	our	peripheral	vision	.	We	see	light	reflected	off	the	Moon	.	And	in	the	time	since	Galileo	pointed	that	rudimentary	telescope	at	the	celestial	bodies	,	the	known	universe	has	come	to	us	through	light	,	across	vast	eras	in	cosmic	history	.
And	with	all	of	our	modern	telescopes	,	we	've	been	able	to	collect	this	stunning	silent	movie	of	the	universe	--	these	series	of	snapshots	that	go	all	the	way	back	to	the	Big	Bang	.
And	yet	,	the	universe	is	not	a	silent	movie	because	the	universe	is	n't	silent	.
I	'd	like	to	convince	you	that	the	universe	has	a	soundtrack	and	that	soundtrack	is	played	on	space	itself	,
because	space	can	wobble	like	a	drum	.
It	can	ring	out	a	kind	of	recording	throughout	the	universe	of	some	of	the	most	dramatic	events	as	they	unfold	.
Now	we	'd	like	to	be	able	to	add	to	a	kind	of	glorious	visual	composition	that	we	have	of	the	universe	--	a	sonic	composition	.
And	while	we	've	never	heard	the	sounds	from	space	,	we	really	should	,	in	the	next	few	years	,	start	to	turn	up	the	volume	on	what	's	going	on	out	there	.
So	in	this	ambition	to	capture	songs	from	the	universe	,	we	turn	our	focus	to	black	holes	and	the	promise	they	have	,	because	black	holes	can	bang	on	space-time	like	mallets	on	a	drum	and	have	a	very	characteristic	song	,
which	I	'd	like	to	play	for	you	--	some	of	our	predictions	for	what	that	song	will	be	like	.
Now	black	holes	are	dark	against	a	dark	sky	.
We	ca	n't	see	them	directly	.
They	're	not	brought	to	us	with	light	,	at	least	not	directly	.
We	can	see	them	indirectly	,	because	black	holes	wreak	havoc	on	their	environment	.
They	destroy	stars	around	them	.
They	churn	up	debris	in	their	surroundings	.
But	they	wo	n't	come	to	us	directly	through	light	.
We	might	one	day	see	a	shadow	a	black	hole	can	cast	on	a	very	bright	background	,	but	we	have	n't	yet	.
And	yet	black	holes	may	be	heard	even	if	they	're	not	seen	,	and	that	's	because	they	bang	on	space-time	like	a	drum	.
Now	we	owe	the	idea	that	space	can	ring	like	a	drum	to	Albert	Einstein	--	to	whom	we	owe	so	much	.
Einstein	realized	that	if	space	were	empty	,	if	the	universe	were	empty	,	it	would	be	like	this	picture	,	except	for	maybe	without	the	helpful	grid	drawn	on	it	.
But	if	we	were	freely	falling	through	the	space	,	even	without	this	helpful	grid	,	we	might	be	able	to	paint	it	ourselves	,	because	we	would	notice	that	we	traveled	along	straight	lines	,	undeflected	straight	paths	through	the	universe	.
Einstein	also	realized	--	and	this	is	the	real	meat	of	the	matter	--	that	if	you	put	energy	or	mass	in	the	universe	,	it	would	curve	space	,
and	a	freely	falling	object	would	pass	by	,	let	's	say	,	the	Sun	and	it	would	be	deflected	along	the	natural	curves	in	the	space	.
It	was	Einstein	's	great	general	theory	of	relativity	.
Now	even	light	will	be	bent	by	those	paths	.
And	you	can	be	bent	so	much	that	you	're	caught	in	orbit	around	the	Sun	,	as	the	Earth	is	,	or	the	Moon	around	the	Earth	.
These	are	the	natural	curves	in	space	.
What	Einstein	did	not	realize	was	that	,	if	you	took	our	Sun	and	you	crushed	it	down	to	six	kilometers	--	so	you	took	a	million	times	the	mass	of	the	Earth	and	you	crushed	it	to	six	kilometers	across	,	you	would	make	a	black	hole	,	an	object	so	dense	that	if	light	veered	too	close	,	it	would	never	escape	--	a	dark	shadow	against	the	universe	.
It	was	n't	Einstein	who	realized	this	,	it	was	Karl	Schwarzschild	who	was	a	German	Jew	in	World	War	I	--	joined	the	German	army	already	an	accomplished	scientist	,	working	on	the	Russian	front	.
I	like	to	imagine	Schwarzschild	in	the	war	in	the	trenches	calculating	ballistic	trajectories	for	cannon	fire	,	and	then	,	in	between	,	calculating	Einstein	's	equations	--	as	you	do	in	the	trenches	.
And	he	was	reading	Einstein	's	recently	published	general	theory	of	relativity	,	and	he	was	thrilled	by	this	theory	.
And	he	quickly	surmised	an	exact	mathematical	solution	that	described	something	very	extraordinary	:	curves	so	strong	that	space	would	rain	down	into	them	,	space	itself	would	curve	like	a	waterfall	flowing	down	the	throat	of	a	hole	.
And	even	light	could	not	escape	this	current	.
Light	would	be	dragged	down	the	hole	as	everything	else	would	be	,	and	all	that	would	be	left	would	be	a	shadow	.
Now	he	wrote	to	Einstein	,	and	he	said	,	``	As	you	will	see	,	the	war	has	been	kind	to	me	enough	.	Despite	the	heavy	gunfire	,
I	've	been	able	to	get	away	from	it	all	and	walk	through	the	land	of	your	ideas	.	''
And	Einstein	was	very	impressed	with	his	exact	solution	,	and	I	should	hope	also	the	dedication	of	the	scientist	.
This	is	the	hardworking	scientist	under	harsh	conditions	.
And	he	took	Schwarzschild	's	idea	to	the	Prussian	Academy	of	Sciences	the	next	week	.
But	Einstein	always	thought	black	holes	were	a	mathematical	oddity	.
He	did	not	believe	they	existed	in	nature	.
He	thought	nature	would	protect	us	from	their	formation	.
It	was	decades	before	the	term	``	black	hole	''	was	coined	and	people	realized	that	black	holes	are	real	astrophysical	objects	--	in	fact	they	're	the	death	state	of	very	massive	stars	that	collapse	catastrophically	at	the	end	of	their	lifetime	.
Now	our	Sun	will	not	collapse	to	a	black	hole	.
It	's	actually	not	massive	enough	.
But	if	we	did	a	little	thought	experiment	--	as	Einstein	was	very	fond	of	doing	--	we	could	imagine	putting	the	Sun	crushed	down	to	six	kilometers	,	and	putting	a	tiny	little	Earth	around	it	in	orbit	,	maybe	30	kilometers	outside	of	the	black-hole	sun	.
And	it	would	be	self-illuminated	,	because	now	the	Sun	's	gone	,	we	have	no	other	source	of	light	--	so	let	's	make	our	little	Earth	self-illuminated	.
And	you	would	realize	you	could	put	the	Earth	in	a	happy	orbit	even	30	km	outside	of	this	crushed	black	hole	.
This	crushed	black	hole	actually	would	fit	inside	Manhattan	,	more	or	less	.
It	might	spill	off	into	the	Hudson	a	little	bit	before	it	destroyed	the	Earth	.
But	basically	that	's	what	we	're	talking	about	.
We	're	talking	about	an	object	that	you	could	crush	down	to	half	the	square	area	of	Manhattan	.
So	we	move	this	Earth	very	close	--	30	kilometers	outside	--	and	we	notice	it	's	perfectly	fine	orbiting	around	the	black	hole	.
There	's	a	sort	of	myth	that	black	holes	devour	everything	in	the	universe	,	but	you	actually	have	to	get	very	close	to	fall	in	.
But	what	's	very	impressive	is	that	,	from	our	vantage	point	,	we	can	always	see	the	Earth	.
It	can	not	hide	behind	the	black	hole	.
The	light	from	the	Earth	,	some	of	it	falls	in	,	but	some	of	it	gets	lensed	around	and	brought	back	to	us	.
So	you	ca	n't	hide	anything	behind	a	black	hole	.
If	this	were	Battlestar	Galactica	and	you	're	fighting	the	Cylons	,	do	n't	hide	behind	the	black	hole	.
They	can	see	you	.
Now	,	our	Sun	will	not	collapse	to	a	black	hole	--	it	's	not	massive	enough	--	but	there	are	tens	of	thousands	of	black	holes	in	our	galaxy	.
And	if	one	were	to	eclipse	the	Milky	Way	,	this	is	what	it	would	look	like	.
We	would	see	a	shadow	of	that	black	hole	against	the	hundred	billion	stars	in	the	Milky	Way	Galaxy	and	its	luminous	dust	lanes	.
And	if	we	were	to	fall	towards	this	black	hole	,	we	would	see	all	of	that	light	lensed	around	it	,	and	we	could	even	start	to	cross	into	that	shadow	and	really	not	notice	that	anything	dramatic	had	happened	.
It	would	be	bad	if	we	tried	to	fire	our	rockets	and	get	out	of	there	because	we	could	n't	,	anymore	than	light	can	escape	.
But	even	though	the	black	hole	is	dark	from	the	outside	,	it	's	not	dark	on	the	inside	,	because	all	of	the	light	from	the	galaxy	can	fall	in	behind	us	.
And	even	though	,	due	to	a	relativistic	effect	known	as	time	dilation	,	our	clocks	would	seem	to	slow	down	relative	to	galactic	time	,	it	would	look	as	though	the	evolution	of	the	galaxy	had	been	sped	up	and	shot	at	us	,	right	before	we	were	crushed	to	death	by	the	black	hole	.
It	would	be	like	a	near-death	experience	where	you	see	the	light	at	the	end	of	the	tunnel	,	but	it	's	a	total	death	experience	.
And	there	's	no	way	of	telling	anybody	about	the	light	at	the	end	of	the	tunnel	.
Now	we	've	never	seen	a	shadow	like	this	of	a	black	hole	,	but	black	holes	can	be	heard	,	even	if	they	're	not	seen	.
Imagine	now	taking	an	astrophysically	realistic	situation	--	imagine	two	black	holes	that	have	lived	a	long	life	together	.
Maybe	they	started	as	stars	and	collapsed	to	two	black	holes	--	each	one	10	times	the	mass	of	the	Sun	.
So	now	we	're	going	to	crush	them	down	to	60	kilometers	across	.
They	can	be	spinning	hundreds	of	times	a	second	.
At	the	end	of	their	lives	,	they	're	going	around	each	other	very	near	the	speed	of	light	.
So	they	're	crossing	thousands	of	kilometers	in	a	fraction	of	a	second	,
and	as	they	do	so	,	they	not	only	curve	space	,	but	they	leave	behind	in	their	wake	a	ringing	of	space	,	an	actual	wave	on	space-time	.
Space	squeezes	and	stretches	as	it	emanates	out	from	these	black	holes	banging	on	the	universe	.
And	they	travel	out	into	the	cosmos	at	the	speed	of	light	.
This	computer	simulation	is	due	to	a	relativity	group	at	NASA	Goddard	.
It	took	almost	30	years	for	anyone	in	the	world	to	crack	this	problem	.
This	was	one	of	the	groups	.
It	shows	two	black	holes	in	orbit	around	each	other	,	again	,	with	these	helpfully	painted	curves	.
And	if	you	can	see	--	it	's	kind	of	faint	--	but	if	you	can	see	the	red	waves	emanating	out	,	those	are	the	gravitational	waves	.
They	're	literally	the	sounds	of	space	ringing	,	and	they	will	travel	out	from	these	black	holes	at	the	speed	of	light	as	they	ring	down	and	coalesce	to	one	spinning	,	quiet	black	hole	at	the	end	of	the	day	.
If	you	were	standing	near	enough	,	your	ear	would	resonate	with	the	squeezing	and	stretching	of	space	.
You	would	literally	hear	the	sound	.
Now	of	course	,	your	head	would	be	squeezed	and	stretched	unhelpfully	,	so	you	might	have	trouble	understanding	what	's	going	on	.
But	I	'd	like	to	play	for	you	the	sound	that	we	predict	.
This	is	from	my	group	--	a	slightly	less	glamorous	computer	modeling	.
Imagine	a	lighter	black	hole	falling	into	a	very	heavy	black	hole	.
The	sound	you	're	hearing	is	the	light	black	hole	banging	on	space	each	time	it	gets	close	.
If	it	gets	far	away	,	it	's	a	little	too	quiet	.
But	it	comes	in	like	a	mallet	,	and	it	literally	cracks	space	,	wobbling	it	like	a	drum	.
And	we	can	predict	what	the	sound	will	be	.
We	know	that	,	as	it	falls	in	,	it	gets	faster	and	it	gets	louder	.
And	eventually	,	we	're	going	to	hear	the	little	guy	just	fall	into	the	bigger	guy	.
Then	it	's	gone	.
Now	I	've	never	heard	it	that	loud	--	it	's	actually	more	dramatic	.
At	home	it	sounds	kind	of	anticlimactic	.
It	's	sort	of	like	ding	,	ding	,	ding	.
This	is	another	sound	from	my	group	.
No	,	I	'm	not	showing	you	any	images	,	because	black	holes	do	n't	leave	behind	helpful	trails	of	ink	,	and	space	is	not	painted	,	showing	you	the	curves	.
But	if	you	were	to	float	by	in	space	on	a	space	holiday	and	you	heard	this	,	you	want	to	get	moving	.
Want	to	get	away	from	the	sound	.
Both	black	holes	are	moving	.
Both	black	holes	are	getting	closer	together	.
In	this	case	,	they	're	both	wobbling	quite	a	lot	.
And	then	they	're	going	to	merge	.
Now	it	's	gone	.
Now	that	chirp	is	very	characteristic	of	black	holes	merging	--	that	it	chirps	up	at	the	end	.
Now	that	's	our	prediction	for	what	we	'll	see	.
Luckily	we	're	at	this	safe	distance	in	Long	Beach	,	California	.
And	surely	,	somewhere	in	the	universe	two	black	holes	have	merged	.
And	surely	,	the	space	around	us	is	ringing	after	traveling	maybe	a	million	light	years	,	or	a	million	years	,	at	the	speed	of	light	to	get	to	us	.
But	the	sound	is	too	quiet	for	any	of	us	to	ever	hear	.
There	are	very	industrious	experiments	being	built	on	Earth	--	one	called	LIGO	--	which	will	detect	deviations	in	the	squeezing	and	stretching	of	space	at	less	than	the	fraction	of	a	nucleus	of	an	atom	over	four	kilometers	.
It	's	a	remarkably	ambitious	experiment	,	and	it	's	going	to	be	at	advanced	sensitivity	within	the	next	few	years	--	to	pick	this	up	.
There	's	also	a	mission	proposed	for	space	,	which	hopefully	will	launch	in	the	next	ten	years	,	called	LISA	.	And	LISA	will	be	able	to	see	super-massive	black	holes	--	black	holes	millions	or	billions	of	times	the	mass	of	the	Sun	.
In	this	Hubble	image	,	we	see	two	galaxies	.
They	look	like	they	're	frozen	in	some	embrace	.
And	each	one	probably	harbors	a	super-massive	black	hole	at	its	core	.
But	they	're	not	frozen	;	they	're	actually	merging	.
These	two	black	holes	are	colliding	,	and	they	will	merge	over	a	billion-year	time	scale	.
It	's	beyond	our	human	perception	to	pick	up	a	song	of	that	duration	.
But	LISA	could	see	the	final	stages	of	two	super-massive	black	holes	earlier	in	the	universe	's	history	,	the	last	15	minutes	before	they	fall	together	.
And	it	's	not	just	black	holes	,	but	it	's	also	any	big	disturbance	in	the	universe	--	and	the	biggest	of	them	all	is	the	Big	Bang	.
When	that	expression	was	coined	,	it	was	derisive	--	like	,	``	Oh	,	who	would	believe	in	a	Big	Bang	?	''	But	now	it	actually	might	be	more	technically	accurate	because	it	might	bang	.	It	might	make	a	sound	.
This	animation	from	my	friends	at	Proton	Studios	shows	looking	at	the	Big	Bang	from	the	outside	.
We	do	n't	ever	want	to	do	that	actually	.	We	want	to	be	inside	the	universe	because	there	's	no	such	thing	as	standing	outside	the	universe	.
So	imagine	you	're	inside	the	Big	Bang	.
It	's	everywhere	,	it	's	all	around	you	,	and	the	space	is	wobbling	chaotically	.
Fourteen	billion	years	pass	and	this	song	is	still	ringing	all	around	us	.
Galaxies	form	,	and	generations	of	stars	form	in	those	galaxies	,
and	around	one	star	,	at	least	one	star	,	is	a	habitable	planet	.
And	here	we	are	frantically	building	these	experiments	,	doing	these	calculations	,	writing	these	computer	codes	.
Imagine	a	billion	years	ago	,	two	black	holes	collided	.
That	song	has	been	ringing	through	space	for	all	that	time	.
We	were	n't	even	here	.
It	gets	closer	and	closer	--	40,000	years	ago	,	we	're	still	doing	cave	paintings	.
It	's	like	hurry	,	build	your	instruments	.
It	's	getting	closer	and	closer	,	and	in	20	...	whatever	year	it	will	be	when	our	detectors	are	finally	at	advanced	sensitivity	--	we	'll	build	them	,	we	'll	turn	on	the	machines	and	,	bang	,	we	'll	catch	it	--	the	first	song	from	space	.
If	it	was	the	Big	Bang	we	were	going	to	pick	up	,	it	would	sound	like	this	.
It	's	a	terrible	sound	.
It	's	literally	the	definition	of	noise	.
It	's	white	noise	;	it	's	such	a	chaotic	ringing	.
But	it	's	around	us	everywhere	,	presumably	,	if	it	has	n't	been	wiped	out	by	some	other	process	in	the	universe	.
And	if	we	pick	it	up	,	it	will	be	music	to	our	ears	because	it	will	be	the	quiet	echo	of	that	moment	of	our	creation	,	of	our	observable	universe	.
So	within	the	next	few	years	,	we	'll	be	able	to	turn	up	the	soundtrack	a	little	bit	,	render	the	universe	in	audio	.
But	if	we	detect	those	earliest	moments	,	it	'll	bring	us	that	much	closer	to	an	understanding	of	the	Big	Bang	,	which	brings	us	that	much	closer	to	asking	some	of	the	hardest	,	most	elusive	,	questions	.
If	we	run	the	movie	of	our	universe	backwards	,	we	know	that	there	was	a	Big	Bang	in	our	past	,	and	we	might	even	hear	the	cacophonous	sound	of	it	,	but	was	our	Big	Bang	the	only	Big	Bang	?
I	mean	we	have	to	ask	,	has	it	happened	before	?
Will	it	happen	again	?
I	mean	,	in	the	spirit	of	rising	to	TED	's	challenge	to	reignite	wonder	,	we	can	ask	questions	,	at	least	for	this	last	minute	,	that	honestly	might	evade	us	forever	.
But	we	have	to	ask	:	Is	it	possible	that	our	universe	is	just	a	plume	off	of	some	greater	history	?
Or	,	is	it	possible	that	we	're	just	a	branch	off	of	a	multiverse	--	each	branch	with	its	own	Big	Bang	in	its	past	--	maybe	some	of	them	with	black	holes	playing	drums	,	maybe	some	without	--	maybe	some	with	sentient	life	,	and	maybe	some	without	--	not	in	our	past	,	not	in	our	future	,	but	somehow	fundamentally	connected	to	us	?
So	we	have	to	wonder	,	if	there	is	a	multiverse	,	in	some	other	patch	of	that	multiverse	,	are	there	creatures	?
Here	's	my	multiverse	creatures	.
Are	there	other	creatures	in	the	multiverse	,	wondering	about	us	and	wondering	about	their	own	origins	?
And	if	they	are	,	I	can	imagine	them	as	we	are	,	calculating	,	writing	computer	code	,	building	instruments	,	trying	to	detect	that	faintest	sound	of	their	origins	and	wondering	who	else	is	out	there	.
Thank	you	.	Thank	you	.
Trees	epitomize	stasis	.
Trees	are	rooted	in	the	ground	in	one	place	for	many	human	generations	,
but	if	we	shift	our	perspective	from	the	trunk	to	the	twigs	,	trees	become	very	dynamic	entities	,	moving	and	growing	.
And	I	decided	to	explore	this	movement	by	turning	trees	into	artists	.
I	simply	tied	the	end	of	a	paintbrush	onto	a	twig	.
I	waited	for	the	wind	to	come	up	and	held	up	a	canvas	,
and	that	produced	art	.
The	piece	of	art	you	see	on	your	left	is	painted	by	a	western	red	cedar	and	that	on	your	right	by	a	Douglas	fir	,
and	what	I	learned	was	that	different	species	have	different	signatures	,	like	a	Picasso	versus	a	Monet	.
But	I	was	also	interested	in	the	movement	of	trees	and	how	this	art	might	let	me	capture	that	and	quantify	it	,
so	to	measure	the	distance	that	a	single	vine	maple	tree	--	which	produced	this	painting	--	moved	in	a	single	year	,	I	simply	measured	and	summed	each	of	those	lines	.
I	multiplied	them	by	the	number	of	twigs	per	branch	and	the	number	of	branches	per	tree	and	then	divided	that	by	the	number	of	minutes	per	year	.
And	so	I	was	able	to	calculate	how	far	a	single	tree	moved	in	a	single	year	.
You	might	have	a	guess	.
The	answer	is	actually	186,540	miles	,	or	seven	times	around	the	globe	.
And	so	simply	by	shifting	our	perspective	from	a	single	trunk	to	the	many	dynamic	twigs	,	we	are	able	to	see	that	trees	are	not	simply	static	entities	,	but	rather	extremely	dynamic	.
And	I	began	to	think	about	ways	that	we	might	consider	this	lesson	of	trees	,	to	consider	other	entities	that	are	also	static	and	stuck	,	but	which	cry	for	change	and	dynamicism	,
and	one	of	those	entities	is	our	prisons	.
Prisons	,	of	course	,	are	where	people	who	break	our	laws	are	stuck	,	confined	behind	bars	.
And	our	prison	system	itself	is	stuck	.
The	United	States	has	over	2.3	million	incarcerated	men	and	women	.
That	number	is	rising	.
Of	the	100	incarcerated	people	that	are	released	,	60	will	return	to	prison	.
Funds	for	education	,	for	training	and	for	rehabilitation	are	declining	,
so	this	despairing	cycle	of	incarceration	continues	.
I	decided	to	ask	whether	the	lesson	I	had	learned	from	trees	as	artists	could	be	applied	to	a	static	institution	such	as	our	prisons	,
and	I	think	the	answer	is	yes	.
In	the	year	2007	,	I	started	a	partnership	with	the	Washington	State	Department	of	Corrections	.	Working	with	four	prisons	,	we	began	bringing	science	and	scientists	,	sustainability	and	conservation	projects	to	four	state	prisons	.
We	give	science	lectures	,
and	the	men	here	are	choosing	to	come	to	our	science	lectures	instead	of	watching	television	or	weightlifting	.
That	,	I	think	,	is	movement	.
We	partnered	with	the	Nature	Conservancy	for	inmates	at	Stafford	Creek	Correctional	Center	to	grow	endangered	prairie	plants	for	restoration	of	relic	prairie	areas	in	Washington	state	.
That	,	I	think	,	is	movement	.
We	worked	with	the	Washington	State	Department	of	Fish	and	Wildlife	to	grow	endangered	frogs	--	the	Oregon	spotted	frog	--	for	later	release	into	protected	wetlands	.
That	,	I	think	,	is	movement	.
And	just	recently	,	we	've	begun	to	work	with	those	men	who	are	segregated	in	what	we	call	Supermax	facilities	.
They	've	incurred	violent	infractions	by	becoming	violent	with	guards	and	with	other	prisoners	.
They	're	kept	in	bare	cells	like	this	for	23	hours	a	day	.
When	they	have	meetings	with	their	review	boards	or	mental	health	professionals	,	they	're	placed	in	immobile	booths	like	this	.
For	one	hour	a	day	they	're	brought	to	these	bleak	and	bland	exercise	yards	.
Although	we	ca	n't	bring	trees	and	prairie	plants	and	frogs	into	these	environments	,	we	are	bringing	images	of	nature	into	these	exercise	yards	,	putting	them	on	the	walls	,	so	at	least	they	get	contact	with	visual	images	of	nature	.
This	is	Mr.	Lopez	,	who	has	been	in	solitary	confinement	for	18	months	,
and	he	's	providing	input	on	the	types	of	images	that	he	believes	would	make	him	and	his	fellow	inmates	more	serene	,	more	calm	,	less	apt	to	violence	.
And	so	what	we	see	,	I	think	,	is	that	small	,	collective	movements	of	change	can	perhaps	move	an	entity	such	as	our	own	prison	system	in	a	direction	of	hope	.
We	know	that	trees	are	static	entities	when	we	look	at	their	trunks	.
But	if	trees	can	create	art	,	if	they	can	encircle	the	globe	seven	times	in	one	year	,	if	prisoners	can	grow	plants	and	raise	frogs	,	then	perhaps	there	are	other	static	entities	that	we	hold	inside	ourselves	,	like	grief	,	like	addictions	,	like	racism	,	that	can	also	change	.
Thank	you	very	much	.
A	human	child	is	born	,	and	for	quite	a	long	time	is	a	consumer	.
It	can	not	be	consciously	a	contributor	.
It	is	helpless	.
It	does	n't	know	how	to	survive	,	even	though	it	is	endowed	with	an	instinct	to	survive	.
It	needs	the	help	of	mother	,	or	a	foster	mother	,	to	survive	.
It	ca	n't	afford	to	doubt	the	person	who	tends	the	child	.
It	has	to	totally	surrender	,	as	one	surrenders	to	an	anesthesiologist	.
It	has	to	totally	surrender	.
That	implies	a	lot	of	trust	.
That	implies	the	trusted	person	wo	n't	violate	the	trust	.
As	the	child	grows	,	it	begins	to	discover	that	the	person	trusted	is	violating	the	trust	.
It	does	n't	know	even	the	word	``	violation	.	''
Therefore	,	it	has	to	blame	itself	,
a	wordless	blame	,	which	is	more	difficult	to	really	resolve	--	the	wordless	self-blame	.
As	the	child	grows	to	become	an	adult	:	so	far	,	it	has	been	a	consumer	,	but	the	growth	of	a	human	being	lies	in	his	or	her	capacity	to	contribute	,	to	be	a	contributor	.
One	can	not	contribute	unless	one	feels	secure	,	one	feels	big	,	one	feels	:	I	have	enough	.
To	be	compassionate	is	not	a	joke	.
It	's	not	that	simple	.
One	has	to	discover	a	certain	bigness	in	oneself	.
That	bigness	should	be	centered	on	oneself	,	not	in	terms	of	money	,	not	in	terms	of	power	you	wield	,	not	in	terms	of	any	status	that	you	can	command	in	the	society	,	but	it	should	be	centered	on	oneself	.
The	self	:	you	are	self-aware	.
On	that	self	,	it	should	be	centered	--	a	bigness	,	a	wholeness	.	Otherwise	,	compassion	is	just	a	word	and	a	dream	.
You	can	be	compassionate	occasionally	,	more	moved	by	empathy	than	by	compassion	.
Thank	God	we	are	empathetic	.
When	somebody	's	in	pain	,	we	pick	up	the	pain	.
In	a	Wimbledon	final	match	,	these	two	guys	fight	it	out	.
Each	one	has	got	two	games	.
It	can	be	anybody	's	game	.
What	they	have	sweated	so	far	has	no	meaning	.
One	person	wins	.
The	tennis	etiquette	is	,	both	the	players	have	to	come	to	the	net	and	shake	hands	.
The	winner	boxes	the	air	and	kisses	the	ground	,	throws	his	shirt	as	though	somebody	is	waiting	for	it	.
And	this	guy	has	to	come	to	the	net	.
When	he	comes	to	the	net	,	you	see	,	his	whole	face	changes	.
It	looks	as	though	he	's	wishing	that	he	did	n't	win	.
Why	?	Empathy	.
That	's	human	heart	.
No	human	heart	is	denied	of	that	empathy	.
No	religion	can	demolish	that	by	indoctrination	.
No	culture	,	no	nation	and	nationalism	--	nothing	can	touch	it	because	it	is	empathy	.
And	that	capacity	to	empathize	is	the	window	through	which	you	reach	out	to	people	,	you	do	something	that	makes	a	difference	in	somebody	's	life	--
even	words	,	even	time	.
Compassion	is	not	defined	in	one	form	.
There	's	no	Indian	compassion	.
There	's	no	American	compassion	.
It	transcends	nation	,	the	gender	,	the	age	.
Why	?	Because	it	is	there	in	everybody	.
It	's	experienced	by	people	occasionally	.
Then	this	occasional	compassion	,	we	are	not	talking	about	--
it	will	never	remain	occasional	.
By	mandate	,	you	can	not	make	a	person	compassionate	.
You	ca	n't	say	,	``	Please	love	me	.	''
Love	is	something	you	discover	.
It	's	not	an	action	,	but	in	the	English	language	,	it	is	also	an	action	.
I	will	come	to	it	later	.
So	one	has	got	to	discover	a	certain	wholeness	.
I	am	going	to	cite	the	possibility	of	being	whole	,	which	is	within	our	experience	,	everybody	's	experience	.
In	spite	of	a	very	tragic	life	,	one	is	happy	in	moments	which	are	very	few	and	far	between	.
And	the	one	who	is	happy	,	even	for	a	slapstick	joke	,	accepts	himself	and	also	the	scheme	of	things	in	which	one	finds	oneself	.
That	means	the	whole	universe	,	known	things	and	unknown	things	.
All	of	them	are	totally	accepted	because	you	discover	your	wholeness	in	yourself	.
The	subject	--	``	me	''	--	and	the	object	--	the	scheme	of	things	--	fuse	into	oneness	,	an	experience	nobody	can	say	,	``	I	am	denied	of	,	''	an	experience	common	to	all	and	sundry	.
That	experience	confirms	that	,	in	spite	of	all	your	limitations	--	all	your	wants	,	desires	,	unfulfilled	,	and	the	credit	cards	and	layoffs	and	,	finally	,	baldness	--	you	can	be	happy	.
But	the	extension	of	the	logic	is	that	you	do	n't	need	to	fulfill	your	desire	to	be	happy	.
You	are	the	very	happiness	,	the	wholeness	that	you	want	to	be	.
There	's	no	choice	in	this	:
that	only	confirms	the	reality	that	the	wholeness	can	not	be	different	from	you	,	can	not	be	minus	you	.
It	has	got	to	be	you	.
You	can	not	be	a	part	of	wholeness	and	still	be	whole	.
Your	moment	of	happiness	reveals	that	reality	,	that	realization	,	that	recognition	:
``	Maybe	I	am	the	whole	.
Maybe	the	swami	is	right	.
Maybe	the	swami	is	right	.	''	You	start	your	new	life	.
Then	everything	becomes	meaningful	.
I	have	no	more	reason	to	blame	myself	.
If	one	has	to	blame	oneself	,	one	has	a	million	reasons	plus	many	.	But	if	I	say	,	in	spite	of	my	body	being	limited	--	if	it	is	black	it	is	not	white	,	if	it	is	white	it	is	not	black	:	body	is	limited	any	which	way	you	look	at	it	.	Limited	.
Your	knowledge	is	limited	,	health	is	limited	,	and	power	is	therefore	limited	,	and	the	cheerfulness	is	going	to	be	limited	.
Compassion	is	going	to	be	limited	.
Everything	is	going	to	be	limitless	.
You	can	not	command	compassion	unless	you	become	limitless	,	and	nobody	can	become	limitless	,	either	you	are	or	you	are	not	.	Period	.
And	there	is	no	way	of	your	being	not	limitless	too	.
Your	own	experience	reveals	,	in	spite	of	all	limitations	,	you	are	the	whole	.
And	the	wholeness	is	the	reality	of	you	when	you	relate	to	the	world	.
It	is	love	first	.
When	you	relate	to	the	world	,	the	dynamic	manifestation	of	the	wholeness	is	,	what	we	say	,	love	.
And	itself	becomes	compassion	if	the	object	that	you	relate	to	evokes	that	emotion	.
Then	that	again	transforms	into	giving	,	into	sharing	.
You	express	yourself	because	you	have	compassion	.
To	discover	compassion	,	you	need	to	be	compassionate	.
To	discover	the	capacity	to	give	and	share	,	you	need	to	be	giving	and	sharing	.
There	is	no	shortcut	:	it	is	like	swimming	by	swimming	.
You	learn	swimming	by	swimming	.
You	can	not	learn	swimming	on	a	foam	mattress	and	enter	into	water	.
You	learn	swimming	by	swimming	.	You	learn	cycling	by	cycling	.
You	learn	cooking	by	cooking	,	having	some	sympathetic	people	around	you	to	eat	what	you	cook	.
And	,	therefore	,	what	I	say	,	you	have	to	fake	it	and	make	it	.
You	need	to	.
My	predecessor	meant	that	.
You	have	to	act	it	out	.
You	have	to	act	compassionately	.
There	is	no	verb	for	compassion	,	but	you	have	an	adverb	for	compassion	.
That	's	interesting	to	me	.
You	act	compassionately	.
But	then	,	how	to	act	compassionately	if	you	do	n't	have	compassion	?
That	is	where	you	fake	.
You	fake	it	and	make	it	.	This	is	the	mantra	of	the	United	States	of	America	.
You	fake	it	and	make	it	.
You	act	compassionately	as	though	you	have	compassion	:	grind	your	teeth	,	take	all	the	support	system	.	If	you	know	how	to	pray	,	pray	.
Ask	for	compassion	.
Let	me	act	compassionately	.
Do	it	.	You	'll	discover	compassion	and	also	slowly	a	relative	compassion	,	and	slowly	,	perhaps	if	you	get	the	right	teaching	,	you	'll	discover	compassion	is	a	dynamic	manifestation	of	the	reality	of	yourself	,	which	is	oneness	,	wholeness	,	and	that	's	what	you	are	.
With	these	words	,	thank	you	very	much	.
The	story	I	wanted	to	share	with	you	today	is	my	challenge	as	an	Iranian	artist	,	as	an	Iranian	woman	artist	,	as	an	Iranian	woman	artist	living	in	exile	.
Well	,	it	has	its	pluses	and	minuses	.
On	the	dark	side	,	politics	does	n't	seem	to	escape	people	like	me	.
Every	Iranian	artist	,	in	one	form	or	another	,	is	political	.
Politics	have	defined	our	lives	.
If	you	're	living	in	Iran	,	you	're	facing	censorship	,	harassment	,	arrest	,	torture	--	at	times	,	execution	.
If	you	're	living	outside	like	me	,	you	're	faced	with	life	in	exile	--	the	pain	of	the	longing	and	the	separation	from	your	loved	ones	and	your	family	.
Therefore	,	we	do	n't	find	the	moral	,	emotional	,	psychological	and	political	space	to	distance	ourselves	from	the	reality	of	social	responsibility	.
Oddly	enough	,	an	artist	such	as	myself	finds	herself	also	in	the	position	of	being	the	voice	,	the	speaker	of	my	people	,	even	if	I	have	,	indeed	,	no	access	to	my	own	country	.
Also	,	people	like	myself	,	we	're	fighting	two	battles	on	different	grounds	.
We	're	being	critical	of	the	West	,	the	perception	of	the	West	about	our	identity	--	about	the	image	that	is	constructed	about	us	,	about	our	women	,	about	our	politics	,	about	our	religion	.
We	are	there	to	take	pride	and	insist	on	respect	.
And	at	the	same	time	,	we	're	fighting	another	battle	.
That	is	our	regime	,	our	government	--	our	atrocious	government	,	[	that	]	has	done	every	crime	in	order	to	stay	in	power	.
Our	artists	are	at	risk	.
We	are	in	a	position	of	danger	.
We	pose	a	threat	to	the	order	of	the	government	.
But	ironically	,	this	situation	has	empowered	all	of	us	,	because	we	are	considered	,	as	artists	,	central	to	the	cultural	,	political	,	social	discourse	in	Iran	.
We	are	there	to	inspire	,	to	provoke	,	to	mobilize	,	to	bring	hope	to	our	people	.
We	are	the	reporters	of	our	people	,	and	are	communicators	to	the	outside	world	.
Art	is	our	weapon	.
Culture	is	a	form	of	resistance	.
I	envy	sometimes	the	artists	of	the	West	for	their	freedom	of	expression	.	For	the	fact	that	they	can	distance	themselves	from	the	question	of	politics	.	From	the	fact	that	they	are	only	serving	one	audience	,	mainly	the	Western	culture	.
But	also	,	I	worry	about	the	West	,	because	often	in	this	country	,	in	this	Western	world	that	we	have	,	culture	risks	being	a	form	of	entertainment	.
Our	people	depend	on	our	artists	,	and	culture	is	beyond	communication	.
My	journey	as	an	artist	started	from	a	very	,	very	personal	place	.
I	did	not	start	to	make	social	commentary	about	my	country	.
The	first	one	that	you	see	in	front	of	you	is	actually	when	I	first	returned	to	Iran	after	being	separated	for	a	good	12	years	.
It	was	after	the	Islamic	Revolution	of	1979	.
While	I	was	absent	from	Iran	,	the	Islamic	Revolution	had	descended	on	Iran	and	had	entirely	transformed	the	country	from	Persian	to	the	Islamic	culture	.
I	came	mainly	to	be	reunited	with	my	family	and	to	reconnect	in	a	way	that	I	found	my	place	in	the	society	.
But	instead	,	I	found	a	country	that	was	totally	ideological	and	that	I	did	n't	recognize	anymore	.
More	so	,	I	became	very	interested	,	as	I	was	facing	my	own	personal	dilemmas	and	questions	,	I	became	immersed	in	the	study	of	the	Islamic	Revolution	--	how	,	indeed	,	it	had	incredibly	transformed	the	lives	of	Iranian	women	.
I	found	the	subject	of	Iranian	women	immensely	interesting	,	in	the	way	the	women	of	Iran	,	historically	,	seemed	to	embody	the	political	transformation	.
So	in	a	way	,	by	studying	a	woman	,	you	can	read	the	structure	and	the	ideology	of	the	country	.
So	I	made	a	group	of	work	that	at	once	faced	my	own	personal	questions	in	life	,	and	yet	it	brought	my	work	into	a	larger	discourse	--	the	subject	of	martyrdom	,	the	question	of	those	who	willingly	stand	in	that	intersection	of	love	of	God	,	faith	,	but	violence	and	crime	and	cruelty	.
For	me	,	this	became	incredibly	important	.
And	yet	,	I	had	an	unusual	position	toward	this	.
I	was	an	outsider	who	had	come	back	to	Iran	to	find	my	place	,	but	I	was	not	in	a	position	to	be	critical	of	the	government	or	the	ideology	of	the	Islamic	Revolution	.
This	changed	slowly	as	I	found	my	voice	and	I	discovered	things	that	I	did	n't	know	I	would	discover	.
So	my	art	became	slightly	more	critical	.
My	knife	became	a	little	sharper	.
And	I	fell	into	a	life	in	exile	.
I	am	a	nomadic	artist	.
I	work	in	Morocco	,	in	Turkey	,	in	Mexico	.
I	go	everywhere	to	make	believe	it	's	Iran	.
Now	I	am	making	films	.
Last	year	,	I	finished	a	film	called	``	Women	Without	Men	.	''
``	Women	Without	Men	''	returns	to	history	,	but	another	part	of	our	Iranian	history	.
It	goes	to	1953	when	American	CIA	exercised	a	coup	and	removed	a	democratically	elected	leader	,	Dr.	Mossadegh	.
The	book	is	written	by	an	Iranian	woman	,	Shahrnush	Parsipur	.
It	's	a	magical	realist	novel	.
This	book	is	banned	,	and	she	spent	five	years	in	prison	.
My	obsession	with	this	book	,	and	the	reason	I	made	this	into	a	film	,	is	because	it	at	once	was	addressing	the	question	of	being	a	female	--	traditionally	,	historically	in	Iran	--	and	the	question	of	four	women	who	are	all	looking	for	an	idea	of	change	,	freedom	and	democracy	--	while	the	country	of	Iran	,	equally	,	as	if	another	character	,	also	struggled	for	an	idea	of	freedom	and	democracy	and	independence	from	the	foreign	interventions	.
I	made	this	film	because	I	felt	it	's	important	for	it	to	speak	to	the	Westerners	about	our	history	as	a	country	.
That	all	of	you	seem	to	remember	Iran	after	the	Islamic	Revolution	.
That	Iran	was	once	a	secular	society	,	and	we	had	democracy	,	and	this	democracy	was	stolen	from	us	by	the	American	government	,	by	the	British	government	.
This	film	also	speaks	to	the	Iranian	people	in	asking	them	to	return	to	their	history	and	look	at	themselves	before	they	were	so	Islamicized	--	in	the	way	we	looked	,	in	the	way	we	played	music	,	in	the	way	we	had	intellectual	life	.
And	most	of	all	,	in	the	way	that	we	fought	for	democracy	.
These	are	some	of	the	shots	actually	from	my	film	.
These	are	some	of	the	images	of	the	coup	.
And	we	made	this	film	in	Casablanca	,	recreating	all	the	shots	.
This	film	tried	to	find	a	balance	between	telling	a	political	story	,	but	also	a	feminine	story	.
Being	a	visual	artist	,	indeed	,	I	am	foremost	interested	to	make	art	--	to	make	art	that	transcends	politics	,	religion	,	the	question	of	feminism	,	and	become	an	important	,	timeless	,	universal	work	of	art	.
The	challenge	I	have	is	how	to	do	that	.	How	to	tell	a	political	story	but	an	allegorical	story	.	How	to	move	you	with	your	emotions	,	but	also	make	your	mind	work	.
These	are	some	of	the	images	and	the	characters	of	the	film	.
Now	comes	the	green	movement	--	the	summer	of	2009	,	as	my	film	is	released	--	the	uprising	begins	in	the	streets	of	Tehran	.
What	is	unbelievably	ironic	is	the	period	that	we	tried	to	depict	in	the	film	,	the	cry	for	democracy	and	social	justice	,	repeats	itself	now	again	in	Tehran	.
The	green	movement	significantly	inspired	the	world	.
It	brought	a	lot	of	attention	to	all	those	Iranians	who	stand	for	basic	human	rights	and	struggle	for	democracy	.
What	was	most	significant	for	me	was	,	once	again	,	the	presence	of	the	women	.
They	're	absolutely	inspirational	for	me	.
If	in	the	Islamic	Revolution	,	the	images	of	the	woman	portrayed	were	submissive	and	did	n't	have	a	voice	,	now	we	saw	a	new	idea	of	feminism	in	the	streets	of	Tehran	--	women	who	were	educated	,	forward	thinking	,	non-traditional	,	sexually	open	,	fearless	and	seriously	feminist	.
These	women	and	those	young	men	united	Iranians	across	the	world	,	inside	and	outside	.
I	then	discovered	why	I	take	so	much	inspiration	from	Iranian	women	.
That	,	under	all	circumstances	,	they	have	pushed	the	boundary	.
They	have	confronted	the	authority	.
They	have	broken	every	rule	in	the	smallest	and	the	biggest	way	.
And	once	again	,	they	proved	themselves	.
I	stand	here	to	say	that	Iranian	women	have	found	a	new	voice	,	and	their	voice	is	giving	me	my	voice	.
And	it	's	a	great	honor	to	be	an	Iranian	woman	and	an	Iranian	artist	,	even	if	I	have	to	operate	in	the	West	only	for	now	.
Thank	you	so	much	.
The	Khan	Academy	is	most	known	for	its	collection	of	videos	,	so	before	I	go	any	further	,	let	me	show	you	a	little	bit	of	a	montage	.
Salman	Khan	:	So	the	hypotenuse	is	now	going	to	be	five	.
This	animal	's	fossils	are	only	found	in	this	area	of	South	America	--	a	nice	clean	band	here	--	and	this	part	of	Africa	.
We	can	integrate	over	the	surface	,	and	the	notation	usually	is	a	capital	sigma	.
National	Assembly	:	They	create	the	Committee	of	Public	Safety	,	which	sounds	like	a	very	nice	committee	.
Notice	,	this	is	an	aldehyde	,	and	it	's	an	alcohol	.
Start	differentiating	into	effector	and	memory	cells	.
A	galaxy	.	Hey	,	there	's	another	galaxy	.
Oh	look	,	there	's	another	galaxy	.
And	for	dollars	,	is	their	30	million	,	plus	the	20	million	dollars	from	the	American	manufacturer	.
If	this	does	not	blow	your	mind	,	then	you	have	no	emotion	.
SK	:	We	now	have	on	the	order	of	2,200	videos	covering	everything	from	basic	arithmetic	all	the	way	to	vector	calculus	and	some	of	the	stuff	you	saw	there	.
We	have	a	million	students	a	month	using	the	site	,	watching	on	the	order	of	100	to	200,000	videos	a	day	.
But	what	we	're	going	to	talk	about	in	this	is	how	we	're	going	to	the	next	level	.
But	before	I	do	that	,	I	want	to	talk	a	little	bit	about	really	just	how	I	got	started	.
And	some	of	you	all	might	know	,	about	five	years	ago	I	was	an	analyst	at	a	hedge	fund	,
and	I	was	in	Boston	,	and	I	was	tutoring	my	cousins	in	New	Orleans	,	remotely	.
And	I	started	putting	the	first	YouTube	videos	up	just	a	supplement	for	my	cousins	--	something	that	might	give	them	a	refresher	or	something	.
And	as	soon	as	I	put	those	first	YouTube	videos	up	,	something	interesting	happened	--	actually	a	bunch	of	interesting	things	happened	.
The	first	was	the	feedback	from	my	cousins	.
They	told	me	that	they	preferred	me	on	YouTube	than	in	person	.
And	once	you	get	over	the	backhanded	nature	of	that	,	there	was	actually	something	very	profound	there	.
They	were	saying	that	they	preferred	the	automated	version	of	their	cousin	to	their	cousin	.
At	first	,	it	's	very	unintuitive	,	but	when	you	actually	think	about	it	from	their	point	of	view	,	it	makes	a	ton	of	sense	.
You	have	this	situation	where	now	they	can	pause	and	repeat	their	cousin	,	without	feeling	like	they	're	wasting	my	time	.
If	they	have	to	review	something	that	they	should	have	learned	a	couple	of	weeks	ago	,	or	maybe	a	couple	of	years	ago	,	they	do	n't	have	to	be	embarrassed	and	ask	their	cousin	.
They	can	just	watch	those	videos	.	If	they	're	bored	,	they	can	go	ahead	.
They	can	watch	it	at	their	own	time	,	at	their	own	pace	.
And	probably	the	least	appreciated	aspect	of	this	is	the	notion	that	the	very	first	time	,	the	very	first	time	that	you	're	trying	to	get	your	brain	around	a	new	concept	,	the	very	last	thing	you	need	is	another	human	being	saying	,	``	Do	you	understand	this	?	''	And	that	's	what	was	happening	with	the	interaction	with	my	cousins	before	,
and	now	they	can	just	do	it	in	the	intimacy	of	their	own	room	.
The	other	thing	that	happened	is	--	I	put	them	on	YouTube	just	--	I	saw	no	reason	to	make	it	private	,	so	I	let	other	people	watch	it	,
and	then	people	started	stumbling	on	it	,
and	I	started	getting	some	comments	and	some	letters	and	all	sorts	of	feedback	from	random	people	from	around	the	world	.
And	these	are	just	a	few	.
This	is	actually	from	one	of	the	original	calculus	videos	.
And	someone	wrote	just	on	YouTube	--	it	was	a	YouTube	comment	:	``	First	time	I	smiled	doing	a	derivative	.	''
And	let	's	pause	here	.
This	person	did	a	derivative	and	then	they	smiled	.
And	then	in	a	response	to	that	same	comment	--	this	is	on	the	thread	.
You	can	go	on	YouTube	and	look	at	these	comments	--	someone	else	wrote	:	``	Same	thing	here	.
I	actually	got	a	natural	high	and	a	good	mood	for	the	entire	day	.	Since	I	remember	seeing	all	of	this	matrix	text	in	class	,	and	here	I	'm	all	like	,	'I	know	kung	fu	.	'	''	And	we	get	a	lot	of	feedback	all	along	those	lines	.
This	clearly	was	helping	people	.
But	then	,	as	the	viewership	kept	growing	and	kept	growing	,	I	started	getting	letters	from	people	,	and	it	was	starting	to	become	clear	that	it	was	actually	more	than	just	a	nice-to-have	.
This	is	just	an	excerpt	from	one	of	those	letters	.
``	My	12	year-old	son	has	autism	and	has	had	a	terrible	time	with	math	.
We	have	tried	everything	,	viewed	everything	,	bought	everything	.
We	stumbled	on	your	video	on	decimals	and	it	got	through	.
Then	we	went	on	to	the	dreaded	fractions	.	Again	,	he	got	it	.
We	could	not	believe	it	.
He	is	so	excited	.	''	And	so	you	can	imagine	,	here	I	was	an	analyst	at	a	hedge	fund	.	It	was	very	strange	for	me	to	do	something	of	social	value	.
But	I	was	excited	,	so	I	kept	going	.
And	then	a	few	other	things	started	to	dawn	on	me	.
That	,	not	only	would	it	help	my	cousins	right	now	,	or	these	people	who	are	sending	letters	,	but	that	this	content	will	never	go	old	,	that	it	could	help	their	kids	or	their	grandkids	.
If	Isaac	Newton	had	done	YouTube	videos	on	calculus	,	I	would	n't	have	to	.
Assuming	he	was	good	.	We	do	n't	know	.
The	other	thing	that	happened	--	and	even	at	this	point	,	I	said	,	``	Okay	,	maybe	it	's	a	good	supplement	.
It	's	good	for	motivated	students	.
It	's	good	for	maybe	home	schoolers	.	''	But	I	did	n't	think	it	would	be	something	that	would	somehow	penetrate	the	classroom	.
But	then	I	started	getting	letters	from	teachers	.
And	the	teachers	would	write	,	saying	,	``	We	've	used	your	videos	to	flip	the	classroom	.
You	've	given	the	lectures	,	so	now	what	we	do	...	``	--	and	this	could	happen	in	every	classroom	in	America	tomorrow	--	``	...	what	I	do	is	I	assign	the	lectures	for	homework	,
and	what	used	to	be	homework	,	I	now	have	the	students	doing	in	the	classroom	.	''	And	I	want	to	pause	here	for	--	I	want	to	pause	here	for	a	second	,	because	there	's	a	couple	of	interesting	things	.
One	,	when	those	teachers	are	doing	that	,	there	's	the	obvious	benefit	--	the	benefit	that	now	their	students	can	enjoy	the	videos	in	the	way	that	my	cousins	did	.
They	can	pause	,	repeat	at	their	own	pace	,	at	their	own	time	.
But	the	more	interesting	thing	is	--	and	this	is	the	unintuitive	thing	when	you	talk	about	technology	in	the	classroom	--	by	removing	the	one-size-fits-all	lecture	from	the	classroom	and	letting	students	have	a	self-paced	lecture	at	home	,	and	then	when	you	go	to	the	classroom	,	letting	them	do	work	,	having	the	teacher	walk	around	,	having	the	peers	actually	be	able	to	interact	with	each	other	,	these	teachers	have	used	technology	to	humanize	the	classroom	.
They	took	a	fundamentally	dehumanizing	experience	--	30	kids	with	their	fingers	on	their	lips	,	not	allowed	to	interact	with	each	other	.
A	teacher	,	no	matter	how	good	,	has	to	give	this	one-size-fits-all	lecture	to	30	students	--	blank	faces	,	slightly	antagonistic	--	and	now	it	's	a	human	experience	.
Now	they	're	actually	interacting	with	each	other	.
So	once	the	Khan	Academy	--	I	quit	my	job	and	we	turned	into	a	real	organization	--	we	're	a	not-for-profit	--	the	question	is	,	how	do	we	take	this	to	the	next	level	?
How	do	we	take	what	those	teachers	are	doing	to	their	natural	conclusion	?
And	so	what	I	'm	showing	you	over	here	,	these	are	actual	exercises	that	I	started	writing	for	my	cousins	.
The	ones	I	started	were	much	more	primitive	.
This	is	a	more	competent	version	of	it	.
But	the	paradigm	here	is	,	we	'll	generate	as	many	questions	as	you	need	until	you	get	that	concept	,	until	you	get	10	in	a	row	.
And	the	Khan	Academy	videos	are	there	.
You	get	hints	,	the	actual	steps	for	that	problem	,	if	you	do	n't	know	how	to	do	it	.
But	the	paradigm	here	,	it	seems	like	a	very	simple	thing	:	10	in	a	row	,	you	move	on	.
But	it	's	fundamentally	different	than	what	's	happening	in	classrooms	right	now	.
In	a	traditional	classroom	,	you	have	a	couple	of	homework	,	homework	,	lecture	,	homework	,	lecture	,	and	then	you	have	a	snapshot	exam	.
And	that	exam	,	whether	you	get	a	70	percent	,	an	80	percent	,	a	90	percent	or	a	95	percent	,	the	class	moves	on	to	the	next	topic	.
And	even	that	95	percent	student	,	what	was	the	five	percent	they	did	n't	know	?
Maybe	they	did	n't	know	what	happens	when	you	raise	something	to	the	zero	power	.
And	then	you	go	build	on	that	in	the	next	concept	.
That	's	analogous	to	imagine	learning	to	ride	a	bicycle	,	and	maybe	I	give	you	a	lecture	ahead	of	time	,	and	I	give	you	that	bicycle	for	two	weeks	.
And	then	I	come	back	after	two	weeks	,	and	I	say	,	``	Well	,	let	's	see	.	You	're	having	trouble	taking	left	turns	.
You	ca	n't	quite	stop	.
You	're	an	80	percent	bicyclist	.	''	So	I	put	a	big	C	stamp	on	your	forehead	and	then	I	say	,	``	Here	's	a	unicycle	.	''	But	as	ridiculous	as	that	sounds	,	that	's	exactly	what	's	happening	in	our	classrooms	right	now	.
And	the	idea	is	you	fast	forward	and	good	students	start	failing	algebra	all	of	a	sudden	and	start	failing	calculus	all	of	a	sudden	,	despite	being	smart	,	despite	having	good	teachers	,
and	it	's	usually	because	they	have	these	Swiss	cheese	gaps	that	kept	building	throughout	their	foundation	.
So	our	model	is	learn	math	the	way	you	'd	learn	anything	,	like	the	way	you	would	learn	a	bicycle	.
Stay	on	that	bicycle	.	Fall	off	that	bicycle	.
Do	it	as	long	as	necessary	until	you	have	mastery	.
The	traditional	model	,	it	penalizes	you	for	experimentation	and	failure	,	but	it	does	not	expect	mastery	.
We	encourage	you	to	experiment	.	We	encourage	you	to	failure	.
But	we	do	expect	mastery	.
This	is	just	another	one	of	the	modules	.
This	is	trigonometry	.
This	is	shifting	and	reflecting	functions	.
And	they	all	fit	together	.
We	have	about	90	of	these	right	now	.
And	you	can	go	to	the	site	right	now	.	It	's	all	free	.	Not	trying	to	sell	anything	.
But	the	general	idea	is	that	they	all	fit	into	this	knowledge	map	.
That	top	node	right	there	,	that	's	literally	single	digit	addition	.
It	's	like	one	plus	one	is	equal	to	two	.
And	the	paradigm	is	,	once	you	get	10	in	a	row	on	that	,	it	keeps	forwarding	you	to	more	and	more	advanced	modules	.
So	if	you	keep	further	down	the	knowledge	map	,	we	're	getting	into	more	advanced	arithmetic	.
Further	down	,	you	start	getting	into	pre-algebra	and	early	algebra	.
Further	down	,	you	start	getting	into	algebra	one	,	algebra	two	,	a	little	bit	of	precalculus	.
And	the	idea	is	,	from	this	we	can	actually	teach	everything	--	well	,	everything	that	can	be	taught	in	this	type	of	a	framework	.
So	you	can	imagine	--	and	this	is	what	we	are	working	on	--	is	from	this	knowledge	map	you	have	logic	,	you	have	computer	programming	,	you	have	grammar	,	you	have	genetics	,	all	based	off	of	that	core	of	,	if	you	know	this	and	that	,	now	you	're	ready	for	this	next	concept	.
Now	that	can	work	well	for	an	individual	learner	,	and	I	encourage	,	one	,	for	you	to	do	it	with	your	kids	,	but	I	also	encourage	everyone	in	the	audience	to	do	it	yourself	.
It	'll	change	what	happens	at	the	dinner	table	.
But	what	we	want	to	do	is	to	use	the	natural	conclusion	of	the	flipping	of	the	classroom	that	those	early	teachers	had	emailed	me	about	.
And	so	what	I	'm	showing	you	here	,	this	is	actually	data	from	a	pilot	in	the	Los	Altos	school	district	,	where	they	took	two	fifth	grade	classes	and	two	seventh	grade	classes	and	completely	gutted	their	old	math	curriculum	.
These	kids	are	n't	using	textbooks	,	they	're	not	getting	one-size-fits-all	lectures	.
They	're	doing	Khan	Academy	,	they	're	doing	that	software	,	for	roughly	half	of	their	math	class	.
And	I	want	to	make	it	clear	,	we	do	n't	view	this	as	the	complete	math	education	.
What	it	does	is	--	and	this	is	what	's	happening	in	Los	Altos	--	it	frees	up	time	.
This	is	the	blocking	and	tackling	,	making	sure	you	know	how	to	move	through	a	system	of	equations	,	and	it	frees	up	time	for	the	simulations	,	for	the	games	,	for	the	mechanics	,	for	the	robot	building	,	for	the	estimating	how	high	that	hill	is	based	on	its	shadow	.
And	so	the	paradigm	is	the	teacher	walks	in	every	day	,	every	kid	works	at	their	own	pace	--	and	this	is	actually	a	live	dashboard	from	Los	Altos	school	district	--	and	they	look	at	this	dashboard	.
Every	row	is	a	student	.
Every	column	is	one	of	those	concepts	.
Green	means	the	student	's	already	proficient	.
Blue	means	they	're	working	on	it	--	no	need	to	worry	.
Red	means	they	're	stuck	.
And	what	the	teacher	does	is	literally	just	say	,	``	Let	me	intervene	on	the	red	kids	.	''	Or	even	better	,	``	Let	me	get	one	of	the	green	kids	who	are	already	proficient	in	that	concept	to	be	the	first	line	of	attack	and	actually	tutor	their	peer	.	''	Now	I	come	from	a	very	data-centric	reality	,	so	we	do	n't	want	that	teacher	to	even	go	and	intervene	and	have	to	ask	the	kid	awkward	questions	:	``	Oh	,	what	do	you	not	understand	?	''	or	``	What	do	you	do	understand	?	''	and	all	of	the	rest	.
So	our	paradigm	is	to	really	arm	the	teachers	with	as	much	data	as	possible	--	really	data	that	,	in	almost	any	other	field	,	is	expected	,	if	you	're	in	finance	or	marketing	or	manufacturing	--
and	so	the	teachers	can	actually	diagnose	what	's	wrong	with	the	students	so	they	can	make	their	interaction	as	productive	as	possible	.
So	now	the	teachers	know	exactly	what	the	students	have	been	up	to	,	how	long	they	have	been	spending	every	day	,	what	videos	have	they	been	watching	,	when	did	they	pause	the	videos	,	what	did	they	stop	watching	,	what	exercises	are	they	using	,	what	have	they	been	focused	on	?
The	outer	circle	shows	what	exercises	they	were	focused	on	.
The	inner	circle	shows	the	videos	they	're	focused	on	.
And	the	data	gets	pretty	granular	so	you	can	see	the	exact	problems	that	the	student	got	right	or	wrong	.
Red	is	wrong	,	blue	is	right	.
The	leftmost	question	is	the	first	question	that	the	student	attempted	.
They	watched	the	video	right	over	there	.
And	then	you	can	see	,	eventually	,	they	were	able	to	get	10	in	a	row	.
It	's	almost	like	you	can	see	them	learning	over	those	last	10	problems	.
They	also	got	faster	.
The	height	is	how	long	it	took	them	.
So	when	you	talk	about	self-paced	learning	,	it	makes	sense	for	everyone	--	in	education-speak	,	differentiated	learning	--	but	it	's	kind	of	crazy	when	you	see	it	in	a	classroom	.
Because	every	time	we	've	done	this	,	in	every	classroom	we	've	done	,	over	and	over	again	,	if	you	go	five	days	into	it	,	there	's	a	group	of	kids	who	've	raced	ahead	and	there	's	a	group	of	kids	who	are	a	little	bit	slower	.
And	in	a	traditional	model	,	if	you	did	a	snapshot	assessment	,	you	say	,	``	These	are	the	gifted	kids	,	these	are	the	slow	kids	.
Maybe	they	should	be	tracked	differently	.
Maybe	we	should	put	them	in	different	classes	.	''	But	when	you	let	every	student	work	at	their	own	pace	--	and	we	see	it	over	and	over	and	over	again	--	you	see	students	who	took	a	little	bit	[	of	]	extra	time	on	one	concept	or	the	other	,	but	once	they	get	through	that	concept	,	they	just	race	ahead	.
And	so	the	same	kids	that	you	thought	were	slow	six	weeks	ago	,	you	now	would	think	are	gifted	.
And	we	're	seeing	it	over	and	over	and	over	again	.
And	it	makes	you	really	wonder	how	much	all	of	the	labels	maybe	a	lot	of	us	have	benefited	from	were	really	just	due	to	a	coincidence	of	time	.
Now	as	valuable	as	something	like	this	is	in	a	district	like	Los	Altos	,	our	goal	is	to	use	technology	to	humanize	,	not	just	in	Los	Altos	,	but	on	a	global	scale	,	what	's	happening	in	education	.
And	actually	,	that	kind	of	brings	an	interesting	point	.
A	lot	of	the	effort	in	humanizing	the	classroom	is	focused	on	student-to-teacher	ratios	.
In	our	mind	,	the	relevant	metric	is	student-to-valuable-human-time-	with-the-teacher	ratio	.
So	in	a	traditional	model	,	most	of	the	teacher	's	time	is	spent	doing	lectures	and	grading	and	whatnot	.
Maybe	five	percent	of	their	time	is	actually	sitting	next	to	students	and	actually	working	with	them	.
Now	100	percent	of	their	time	is	.
So	once	again	,	using	technology	,	not	just	flipping	the	classroom	,	you	're	humanizing	the	classroom	,	I	'd	argue	,	by	a	factor	of	five	or	10	.
And	as	valuable	as	that	is	in	Los	Altos	,	imagine	what	that	does	to	the	adult	learner	who	's	embarrassed	to	go	back	and	learn	stuff	that	they	should	have	before	,	before	going	back	to	college	.
Imagine	what	it	does	to	a	street	kid	in	Calcutta	who	has	to	help	his	family	during	the	day	,	and	that	's	the	reason	why	he	or	she	ca	n't	go	to	school	.
Now	they	can	spend	two	hours	a	day	and	remediate	,	or	get	up	to	speed	and	not	feel	embarrassed	about	what	they	do	or	do	n't	know	.
Now	imagine	what	happens	where	--	we	talked	about	the	peers	teaching	each	other	inside	of	a	classroom	.
But	this	is	all	one	system	.
There	's	no	reason	why	you	ca	n't	have	that	peer-to-peer	tutoring	beyond	that	one	classroom	.
Imagine	what	happens	if	that	student	in	Calcutta	all	of	a	sudden	can	tutor	your	son	,	or	your	son	can	tutor	that	kid	in	Calcutta	?
And	I	think	what	you	'll	see	emerging	is	this	notion	of	a	global	one-world	classroom	.
And	that	's	essentially	what	we	're	trying	to	build	.
Thank	you	.
Bill	Gates	:	I	've	seen	some	things	you	're	doing	in	the	system	that	have	to	do	with	motivation	and	feedback	--	energy	points	,	merit	badges	.
Tell	me	what	you	're	thinking	there	.
SK	:	Oh	yeah	.	No	,	we	have	an	awesome	team	working	on	it	.
And	I	have	to	make	it	clear	,	it	's	not	just	me	anymore	.
I	'm	still	doing	all	the	videos	,	but	we	have	a	rockstar	team	doing	the	software	.
Yeah	,	we	've	put	a	bunch	of	game	mechanics	in	there	where	you	get	these	badges	,	we	're	going	to	start	having	leader	boards	by	area	,	and	you	get	points	.
It	's	actually	been	pretty	interesting	.
Just	the	wording	of	the	badging	or	how	many	points	you	get	for	doing	something	,	we	see	on	a	system-wide	basis	,	like	tens	of	thousands	of	fifth	graders	or	sixth	graders	going	one	direction	or	another	,	depending	what	badge	you	give	them	.
BG	:	And	the	collaboration	you	're	doing	with	Los	Altos	,	how	did	that	come	about	?
SK	:	Los	Altos	,	it	was	kind	of	crazy	.
Once	again	,	I	did	n't	expect	it	to	be	used	in	classrooms	.
Someone	from	their	board	came	and	said	,	``	What	would	you	do	if	you	had	carte	blanche	in	a	classroom	?	''	And	I	said	,	``	Well	,	I	would	just	,	every	student	work	at	their	own	pace	on	something	like	this	and	we	'd	give	a	dashboard	.	''	And	they	said	,	``	Oh	,	this	is	kind	of	radical	.	We	have	to	think	about	it	.	''	And	me	and	the	rest	of	the	team	were	like	,	``	They	're	never	going	to	want	to	do	this	.	''	But	literally	the	next	day	they	were	like	,	``	Can	you	start	in	two	weeks	?	''	BG	:	So	fifth	grade	math	is	where	that	's	going	on	right	now	?
SK	:	It	's	two	fifth	grade	classes	and	two	seventh	grade	classes	.
And	they	're	doing	it	at	the	district	level	.
I	think	what	they	're	excited	about	is	they	can	now	follow	these	kids	.
It	's	not	an	only-in-school	thing	.
We	've	even	,	on	Christmas	,	we	saw	some	of	the	kids	were	doing	it	.
And	we	can	track	everything	.
So	they	can	actually	track	them	as	they	go	through	the	entire	district	.
Through	the	summers	,	as	they	go	from	one	teacher	to	the	next	,	you	have	this	continuity	of	data	that	even	at	the	district	level	they	can	see	.
BG	:	So	some	of	those	views	we	saw	were	for	the	teacher	to	go	in	and	track	actually	what	's	going	on	with	those	kids	.
So	you	're	getting	feedback	on	those	teacher	views	to	see	what	they	think	they	mean	?
SK	:	Oh	yeah	.	Most	of	those	were	specs	by	the	teachers	.
We	made	some	of	those	for	students	so	they	could	see	their	data	,	but	we	have	a	very	tight	design	loop	with	the	teachers	themselves	.
And	they	're	literally	saying	,	``	Hey	,	this	is	nice	,	but	...	``	Like	that	focus	graph	,	a	lot	of	the	teachers	said	,	``	I	have	a	feeling	that	a	lot	of	the	kids	are	jumping	around	and	not	focusing	on	one	topic	.	''	So	we	made	that	focus	diagram	.
So	it	's	all	been	teacher-driven	.
It	's	been	pretty	crazy	.
BG	:	Is	this	ready	for	prime	time	?
Do	you	think	a	lot	of	classes	next	school	year	should	try	this	thing	out	?
SK	:	Yeah	,	it	's	ready	.
We	've	got	a	million	people	on	the	site	already	,	so	we	can	handle	a	few	more	.
No	,	no	reason	why	it	really	ca	n't	happen	in	every	classroom	in	America	tomorrow	.
BG	:	And	the	vision	of	the	tutoring	thing	.
The	idea	there	is	,	if	I	'm	confused	about	a	topic	,	somehow	right	in	the	user	interface	I	'd	find	people	who	are	volunteering	,	maybe	see	their	reputation	,	and	I	could	schedule	and	connect	up	with	those	people	?
SK	:	Absolutely	.	And	this	is	something	that	I	recommend	everyone	in	this	audience	to	do	.
Those	dashboards	the	teachers	have	,	you	can	go	log	in	right	now	and	you	can	essentially	become	a	coach	for	your	kids	,	or	nephews	,	or	cousins	,	or	maybe	some	kids	at	the	Boys	and	Girls	Club	.
And	yeah	,	you	can	start	becoming	a	mentor	,	a	tutor	,	really	immediately	.
But	yeah	,	it	's	all	there	.
BG	:	Well	,	it	's	amazing	.
I	think	you	just	got	a	glimpse	of	the	future	of	education	.
Thank	you	.
We	see	with	the	eyes	,
but	we	see	with	the	brain	as	well	.
And	seeing	with	the	brain	is	often	called	imagination	.
And	we	are	familiar	with	the	landscapes	of	our	own	imagination	,	our	inscapes	.	We	've	lived	with	them	all	our	lives	.
But	there	are	also	hallucinations	as	well	,
and	hallucinations	are	completely	different	.
They	do	n't	seem	to	be	of	our	creation	.
They	do	n't	seem	to	be	under	our	control	.
They	seem	to	come	from	the	outside	,	and	to	mimic	perception	.
So	I	am	going	to	be	talking	about	hallucinations	,
and	a	particular	sort	of	visual	hallucination	which	I	see	among	my	patients	.
A	few	months	ago	,	I	got	a	phone	call	from	a	nursing	home	where	I	work	.
They	told	me	that	one	of	their	residents	,	an	old	lady	in	her	90s	,	was	seeing	things	,
and	they	wondered	if	she	'd	gone	bonkers
or	,	because	she	was	an	old	lady	,	whether	she	'd	had	a	stroke	,	or	whether	she	had	Alzheimer	's	.
And	so	they	asked	me	if	I	would	come	and	see	Rosalie	,	the	old	lady	.
I	went	in	to	see	her	.
It	was	evident	straight	away	that	she	was	perfectly	sane	and	lucid	and	of	good	intelligence	,
but	she	'd	been	very	startled	and	very	bewildered	,	because	she	'd	been	seeing	things	.
And	she	told	me	--	the	nurses	had	n't	mentioned	this	--	that	she	was	blind	,	that	she	had	been	completely	blind	from	macular	degeneration	for	five	years	.
But	now	,	for	the	last	few	days	,	she	'd	been	seeing	things	.
So	I	said	,	``	What	sort	of	things	?	''
And	she	said	,	``	People	in	Eastern	dress	,	in	drapes	,	walking	up	and	down	stairs	.
A	man	who	turns	towards	me	and	smiles	.
But	he	has	huge	teeth	on	one	side	of	his	mouth	.
Animals	too	.
I	see	a	white	building	.	It	's	snowing	,	a	soft	snow	.
I	see	this	horse	with	a	harness	,	dragging	the	snow	away	.
Then	,	one	night	,	the	scene	changes	.
I	see	cats	and	dogs	walking	towards	me	.	They	come	to	a	certain	point	and	then	stop	.
Then	it	changes	again	.
I	see	a	lot	of	children	.	They	are	walking	up	and	down	stairs	.
They	wear	bright	colors	,	rose	and	blue	,	like	Eastern	dress	.	''
Sometimes	,	she	said	,	before	the	people	come	on	,	she	may	hallucinate	pink	and	blue	squares	on	the	floor	,	which	seem	to	go	up	to	the	ceiling	.
I	said	,	``	Is	this	like	a	dream	?	''
And	she	said	,	``	No	,	it	's	not	like	a	dream	.	It	's	like	a	movie	.	''
She	said	,	``	It	's	got	color	.	It	's	got	motion	.
But	it	's	completely	silent	,	like	a	silent	movie	.	''
And	she	said	that	it	's	a	rather	boring	movie	.
She	said	,	``	All	these	people	with	Eastern	dress	,	walking	up	and	down	,	very	repetitive	,	very	limited	.	''
And	she	has	a	sense	of	humor	.
She	knew	it	was	a	hallucination	.
But	she	was	frightened	.	She	'd	lived	95	years	and	she	'd	never	had	a	hallucination	before	.
She	said	that	the	hallucinations	were	unrelated	to	anything	she	was	thinking	or	feeling	or	doing	,
that	they	seemed	to	come	on	by	themselves	,	or	disappear	.
She	had	no	control	over	them	.
She	said	she	did	n't	recognize	any	of	the	people	or	places	in	the	hallucinations	.
And	none	of	the	people	or	the	animals	,	well	,	they	all	seemed	oblivious	of	her	.
And	she	did	n't	know	what	was	going	on	.
She	wondered	if	she	was	going	mad	or	losing	her	mind	.
Well	,	I	examined	her	carefully	.
She	was	a	bright	old	lady	,
perfectly	sane	.	She	had	no	medical	problems	.
She	was	n't	on	any	medications	which	could	produce	hallucinations	.
But	she	was	blind	.
And	I	then	said	to	her	,	``	I	think	I	know	what	you	have	.	''
I	said	,	``	There	is	a	special	form	of	visual	hallucination	which	may	go	with	deteriorating	vision	or	blindness	.	This	was	originally	described	,	''	I	said	,	``	right	back	in	the	18th	century	,	by	a	man	called	Charles	Bonnet	.
And	you	have	Charles	Bonnet	syndrome	.
There	is	nothing	wrong	with	your	brain	.	There	is	nothing	wrong	with	your	mind	.
You	have	Charles	Bonnet	syndrome	.	''
And	she	was	very	relieved	at	this	,	that	there	was	nothing	seriously	the	matter	,	and	also	rather	curious	.
She	said	,	``	Who	is	this	Charles	Bonnet	?	''
She	said	,	``	Did	he	have	them	himself	?	''
And	she	said	,	``	Tell	all	the	nurses	that	I	have	Charles	Bonnet	syndrome	.	''
``	I	'm	not	crazy	.	I	'm	not	demented	.	I	have	Charles	Bonnet	syndrome	.	''
Well	,	so	I	did	tell	the	nurses	.
Now	this	,	for	me	,	is	a	common	situation	.
I	work	in	old-age	homes	,	largely	.
I	see	a	lot	of	elderly	people	who	are	hearing	impaired	or	visually	impaired	.
About	10	percent	of	the	hearing	impaired	people	get	musical	hallucinations	.
And	about	10	percent	of	the	visually	impaired	people	get	visual	hallucinations	.
You	do	n't	have	to	be	completely	blind	,	only	sufficiently	impaired	.
Now	with	the	original	description	in	the	18th	century	,	Charles	Bonnet	did	not	have	them	.
His	grandfather	had	these	hallucinations	.
His	grandfather	was	a	magistrate	,	an	elderly	man	.
He	'd	had	cataract	surgery	.
His	vision	was	pretty	poor	.
And	in	1759	,	he	described	to	his	grandson	various	things	he	was	seeing	.
The	first	thing	he	said	was	he	saw	a	handkerchief	in	midair	.
It	was	a	large	blue	handkerchief	with	four	orange	circles	.
And	he	knew	it	was	a	hallucination	.
You	do	n't	have	handkerchiefs	in	midair	.
And	then	he	saw	a	big	wheel	in	midair	.
But	sometimes	he	was	n't	sure	whether	he	was	hallucinating	or	not	,
because	the	hallucinations	would	fit	in	the	context	of	the	visions	.
So	on	one	occasion	,	when	his	granddaughters	were	visiting	them	,	he	said	,	``	And	who	are	these	handsome	young	men	with	you	?	''
And	they	said	,	``	Alas	,	Grandpapa	,	there	are	no	handsome	young	men	.	''
And	then	the	handsome	young	men	disappeared	.
It	's	typical	of	these	hallucinations	that	they	may	come	in	a	flash	and	disappear	in	a	flash	.
They	do	n't	usually	fade	in	and	out	.
They	are	rather	sudden	,	and	they	change	suddenly	.
Charles	Lullin	,	the	grandfather	,	saw	hundreds	of	different	figures	,	different	landscapes	of	all	sorts	.
On	one	occasion	,	he	saw	a	man	in	a	bathrobe	smoking	a	pipe	,	and	realized	it	was	himself	.
That	was	the	only	figure	he	recognized	.
On	one	occasion	when	he	was	walking	in	the	streets	of	Paris	,	he	saw	--	this	was	real	--	a	scaffolding	.
But	when	he	got	back	home	,	he	saw	a	miniature	of	the	scaffolding	six	inches	high	,	on	his	study	table	.
This	repetition	of	perception	is	sometimes	called	palinopsia	.
With	him	and	with	Rosalie	,	what	seems	to	be	going	on	--	and	Rosalie	said	,	``	What	's	going	on	?	''	--	and	I	said	that	as	you	lose	vision	,	as	the	visual	parts	of	the	brain	are	no	longer	getting	any	input	,	they	become	hyperactive	and	excitable	,
and	they	start	to	fire	spontaneously	.
And	you	start	to	see	things	.
The	things	you	see	can	be	very	complicated	indeed	.
With	another	patient	of	mine	,	who	,	also	had	some	vision	,	the	vision	she	had	could	be	disturbing	.
On	one	occasion	,	she	said	she	saw	a	man	in	a	striped	shirt	in	a	restaurant	.
And	he	turned	around	.	And	then	he	divided	into	six	figures	in	striped	shirts	,	who	started	walking	towards	her	.
And	then	the	six	figures	came	together	again	,	like	a	concertina	.
Once	,	when	she	was	driving	,	or	rather	,	her	husband	was	driving	,	the	road	divided	into	four
and	she	felt	herself	going	simultaneously	up	four	roads	.
She	had	very	mobile	hallucinations	as	well	.
A	lot	of	them	had	to	do	with	a	car	.
Sometimes	she	would	see	a	teenage	boy	sitting	on	the	hood	of	the	car	.
He	was	very	tenacious	and	he	moved	rather	gracefully	when	the	car	turned	.
And	then	when	they	came	to	a	stop	,	the	boy	would	do	a	sudden	vertical	takeoff	,	100	foot	in	the	air	,	and	then	disappear	.
Another	patient	of	mine	had	a	different	sort	of	hallucination	.	This	was	a	woman	who	did	n't	have	trouble	with	her	eyes	,	but	the	visual	parts	of	her	brain	,
a	little	tumor	in	the	occipital	cortex	.
And	,	above	all	,	she	would	see	cartoons	.
These	cartoons	would	be	transparent	and	would	cover	half	the	visual	field	,	like	a	screen	.
And	especially	she	saw	cartoons	of	Kermit	the	Frog	.
Now	,	I	do	n't	watch	Sesame	Street	,
but	she	made	a	point	of	saying	,	``	Why	Kermit	?	''	She	said	,	``	Kermit	the	Frog	means	nothing	to	me	.
You	know	,	I	was	wondering	about	Freudian	determinants	.
Why	Kermit	?
Kermit	the	Frog	means	nothing	to	me	.	''
She	did	n't	mind	the	cartoons	too	much	.	But	what	did	disturb	her	was	she	got	very	persistent	images	or	hallucinations	of	faces	and	as	with	Rosalie	,	the	faces	were	often	deformed	,	with	very	large	teeth	or	very	large	eyes	.
And	these	frightened	her	.
Well	,	what	is	going	on	with	these	people	?
As	a	physician	,	I	have	to	try	and	define	what	's	going	on	,	and	to	reassure	people	,
especially	to	reassure	them	that	they	're	not	going	insane	.
Something	like	10	percent	,	as	I	said	,	of	visually	impaired	people	get	these	.
But	no	more	than	one	percent	of	the	people	acknowledge	them	,
because	they	are	afraid	they	will	be	seen	as	insane	or	something	.
And	if	they	do	mention	them	to	their	own	doctors	they	may	be	misdiagnosed	.
In	particular	,	the	notion	is	that	if	you	see	things	or	hear	things	,	you	're	going	mad	,
but	the	psychotic	hallucinations	are	quite	different	.
Psychotic	hallucinations	,	whether	they	are	visual	or	vocal	,	they	address	you	.	They	accuse	you	.
They	seduce	you	.	They	humiliate	you	.
They	jeer	at	you	.
You	interact	with	them	.
There	is	none	of	this	quality	of	being	addressed	with	these	Charles	Bonnet	hallucinations	.
There	is	a	film	.	You	're	seeing	a	film	which	has	nothing	to	do	with	you	,
or	that	's	how	people	think	about	it	.
There	is	also	a	rare	thing	called	temporal	lobe	epilepsy	,
and	sometimes	,	if	one	has	this	,	one	may	feel	oneself	transported	back	to	a	time	and	place	in	the	past	.
You	're	at	a	particular	road	junction	.
You	smell	chestnuts	roasting	.
You	hear	the	traffic	.	All	the	senses	are	involved	.
And	you	're	waiting	for	your	girl	.
And	it	's	that	Tuesday	evening	back	in	1982	.
And	the	temporal	lobe	hallucinations	are	all-sense	hallucinations	,	full	of	feeling	,	full	of	familiarity	,	located	in	space	and	time	,	coherent	,	dramatic	.
The	Charles	Bonnet	ones	are	quite	different	.
So	in	the	Charles	Bonnet	hallucinations	,	you	have	all	sorts	of	levels	,	from	the	geometrical	hallucinations	--	the	pink	and	blue	squares	the	woman	had	--	up	to	quite	elaborate	hallucinations	with	figures	and	especially	faces	.
Faces	,	and	sometimes	deformed	faces	,	are	the	single	commonest	thing	in	these	hallucinations	.
And	one	of	the	second	commonest	is	cartoons	.
So	,	what	is	going	on	?
Fascinatingly	,	in	the	last	few	years	,	it	's	been	possible	to	do	functional	brain	imagery	,	to	do	fMRI	on	people	as	they	are	hallucinating	.
And	in	fact	,	to	find	that	different	parts	of	the	visual	brain	are	activated	as	they	are	hallucinating	.
When	people	have	these	simple	geometrical	hallucinations	,	the	primary	visual	cortex	is	activated	.
This	is	the	part	of	the	brain	which	perceives	edges	and	patterns	.
You	do	n't	form	images	with	your	primary	visual	cortex	.
When	images	are	formed	,	a	higher	part	of	the	visual	cortex	is	involved	in	the	temporal	lobe	.
And	in	particular	,	one	area	of	the	temporal	lobe	is	called	the	fusiform	gyrus	.
And	it	's	known	that	if	people	have	damage	in	the	fusiform	gyrus	,	they	maybe	lose	the	ability	to	recognize	faces	.
But	if	there	is	an	abnormal	activity	in	the	fusiform	gyrus	,	they	may	hallucinate	faces	,
and	this	is	exactly	what	you	find	in	some	of	these	people	.
There	is	an	area	in	the	anterior	part	of	this	gyrus	where	teeth	and	eyes	are	represented	,
and	that	part	of	the	gyrus	is	activated	when	people	get	the	deformed	hallucinations	.
There	is	another	part	of	the	brain	which	is	especially	activated	when	one	sees	cartoons	.
It	's	activated	when	one	recognizes	cartoons	,	when	one	draws	cartoons	,	and	when	one	hallucinates	them	.
It	's	very	interesting	that	that	should	be	specific	.
There	are	other	parts	of	the	brain	which	are	specifically	involved	with	the	recognition	and	hallucination	of	buildings	and	landscapes	.
Around	1970	,	it	was	found	that	there	were	not	only	parts	of	the	brain	,	but	particular	cells	.
``	Face	cells	''	were	discovered	around	1970	.
And	now	we	know	that	there	are	hundreds	of	other	sorts	of	cells	,	which	can	be	very	,	very	specific	.
So	you	may	not	only	have	``	car	''	cells	,	you	may	have	``	Aston	Martin	''	cells	.
I	saw	an	Aston	Martin	this	morning	.
I	had	to	bring	it	in	.
And	now	it	's	in	there	somewhere	.
Now	,	at	this	level	,	in	what	's	called	the	inferotemporal	cortex	,	there	are	only	visual	images	,	or	figments	or	fragments	.
It	's	only	at	higher	levels	that	the	other	senses	join	in	and	there	are	connections	with	memory	and	emotion	.
And	in	the	Charles	Bonnet	syndrome	,	you	do	n't	go	to	those	higher	levels	.
You	're	in	these	levels	of	inferior	visual	cortex	where	you	have	thousands	and	tens	of	thousands	and	millions	of	images	,	or	figments	,	or	fragmentary	figments	,	all	neurally	encoded	in	particular	cells	or	small	clusters	of	cells	.
Normally	these	are	all	part	of	the	integrated	stream	of	perception	,	or	imagination	,
and	one	is	not	conscious	of	them	.
It	is	only	if	one	is	visually	impaired	or	blind	that	the	process	is	interrupted	.
And	instead	of	getting	normal	perception	,	you	're	getting	an	anarchic	,	convulsive	stimulation	,	or	release	,	of	all	of	these	visual	cells	in	the	inferotemporal	cortex	.
So	,	suddenly	you	see	a	face	.	Suddenly	you	see	a	car	.
Suddenly	this	,	and	suddenly	that	.
The	mind	does	its	best	to	organize	and	to	give	some	sort	of	coherence	to	this	,
but	not	terribly	successfully	.
When	these	were	first	described	,	it	was	thought	that	they	could	be	interpreted	like	dreams	.
But	in	fact	people	say	,	``	I	do	n't	recognize	the	people	.	I	ca	n't	form	any	associations	.	''
``	Kermit	means	nothing	to	me	.	''
You	do	n't	get	anywhere	thinking	of	them	as	dreams	.
Well	,	I	've	more	or	less	said	what	I	wanted	.
I	think	I	just	want	to	recapitulate	and	say	this	is	common	.
Think	of	the	number	of	blind	people	.
There	must	be	hundreds	of	thousands	of	blind	people	who	have	these	hallucinations	,	but	are	too	scared	to	mention	them	.
So	this	sort	of	thing	needs	to	be	brought	into	notice	,	for	patients	,	for	doctors	,	for	the	public	.
Finally	,	I	think	they	are	infinitely	interesting	and	valuable	,	for	giving	one	some	insight	as	to	how	the	brain	works	.
Charles	Bonnet	said	,	250	years	ago	--	he	wondered	how	,	thinking	these	hallucinations	,	how	,	as	he	put	it	,	the	theater	of	the	mind	could	be	generated	by	the	machinery	of	the	brain	.
Now	,	250	years	later	,	I	think	we	're	beginning	to	glimpse	how	this	is	done	.
Thanks	very	much	.
Chris	Anderson	:	That	was	superb	.	Thank	you	so	much	.
You	speak	about	these	things	with	so	much	insight	and	empathy	for	your	patients	.
Have	you	yourself	experienced	any	of	the	syndromes	you	write	about	?
Oliver	Sacks	:	I	was	afraid	you	'd	ask	that	.
Well	,	yeah	,	a	lot	of	them	.
And	actually	I	'm	a	little	visually	impaired	myself	.
I	'm	blind	in	one	eye	,	and	not	terribly	good	in	the	other	.
And	I	see	the	geometrical	hallucinations	.
But	they	stop	there	.
CA	:	And	they	do	n't	disturb	you	?
Because	you	understand	what	's	doing	it	,	it	does	n't	make	you	worried	?
OS	:	Well	they	do	n't	disturb	me	any	more	than	my	tinnitus	,
which	I	ignore	.
They	occasionally	interest	me	,
and	I	have	many	pictures	of	them	in	my	notebooks	.
I	've	gone	and	had	an	fMRI	myself	,	to	see	how	my	visual	cortex	is	taking	over	.
And	when	I	see	all	these	hexagons	and	complex	things	,	which	I	also	have	,	in	visual	migraine	,	I	wonder	whether	everyone	sees	things	like	this	,	and	whether	things	like	cave	art	or	ornamental	art	may	have	been	derived	from	them	a	bit	.
CA	:	That	was	an	utterly	,	utterly	fascinating	talk	.
Thank	you	so	much	for	sharing	.
OS	:	Thank	you	.	Thank	you	.
So	I	want	to	take	you	on	a	trip	to	an	alien	world	.
And	it	's	not	a	trip	that	requires	light-years	of	travel	,	but	it	's	to	a	place	where	it	's	defined	by	light	.
So	it	's	a	little-appreciated	fact	that	most	of	the	animals	in	our	ocean	make	light	.
I	've	spent	most	of	my	career	studying	this	phenomenon	called	bioluminescence	.
I	study	it	because	I	think	understanding	it	is	critical	to	understanding	life	in	the	ocean	where	most	bioluminescence	occurs	.
I	also	use	it	as	a	tool	for	visualizing	and	tracking	pollution	.
But	mostly	I	'm	entranced	by	it	.
Since	my	my	first	dive	in	a	deep-diving	submersible	,	when	I	went	down	and	turned	out	the	lights	and	saw	the	fireworks	displays	,	I	've	been	a	bioluminescence	junky	.
But	I	would	come	back	from	those	dives	and	try	to	share	the	experience	with	words	,	and	they	were	totally	inadequate	to	the	task	.
I	needed	some	way	to	share	the	experience	directly	.
And	the	first	time	I	figured	out	that	way	was	in	this	little	single-person	submersible	called	Deep	Rover	.
This	next	video	clip	,	you	're	going	to	see	how	we	stimulated	the	bioluminescence	.
And	the	first	thing	you	're	going	to	see	is	a	transect	screen	that	is	about	a	meter	across	.
Narrator	:	In	front	of	the	sub	,	a	mess	screen	will	come	into	contact	with	the	soft-bodied	creatures	of	the	deep	sea	.
With	the	sub	's	lights	switched	off	,	it	is	possible	to	see	their	bioluminescence	--	the	light	produced	when	they	collide	with	the	mesh	.
This	is	the	first	time	it	has	ever	been	recorded	.
Edith	Widder	:	So	I	recorded	that	with	an	intensified	video	camera	that	has	about	the	sensitivity	of	the	fully	dark-adapted	human	eye	.
Which	means	that	really	is	what	you	would	see	if	you	took	a	dive	in	a	submersible	.
But	just	to	try	to	prove	that	fact	to	you	,	I	've	brought	along	some	bioluminescent	plankton	in	what	is	undoubtedly	a	foolhardy	attempt	at	a	live	demonstration	.
So	,	if	we	could	have	the	lights	down	and	have	it	as	dark	in	here	as	possible	,	I	have	a	flask	that	has	bioluminescent	plankton	in	it	.
And	you	'll	note	there	's	no	light	coming	from	them	right	now	,	either	because	they	're	dead	--	or	because	I	need	to	stir	them	up	in	some	way	for	you	to	see	what	bioluminescence	really	looks	like	.
Oops	.	Sorry	.
I	spend	most	of	my	time	working	in	the	dark	;	I	'm	used	to	that	.
Okay	.
So	that	light	was	made	by	a	bioluminescent	dinoflagellate	,	a	single-celled	alga	.
So	why	would	a	single-celled	alga	need	to	be	able	to	produce	light	?
Well	,	it	uses	it	to	defend	itself	from	its	predators	.
The	flash	is	like	a	scream	for	help	.
It	's	what	's	known	as	a	bioluminescent	burglar	alarm	,
and	just	like	the	alarm	on	your	car	or	your	house	,	it	's	meant	to	cast	unwanted	attention	onto	the	intruder	,	thereby	either	leading	to	his	capture	or	scaring	him	away	.
There	's	a	lot	of	animals	that	use	this	trick	,	for	example	this	black	dragonfish	.
It	's	got	a	light	organ	under	its	eye	.
It	's	got	a	chin	barbel	.
It	's	got	a	lot	of	other	light	organs	you	ca	n't	see	,	but	you	'll	see	in	here	in	a	minute	.
So	we	had	to	chase	this	in	the	submersible	for	quite	sometime	,	because	the	top	speed	of	this	fish	is	one	knot	,	which	was	the	top	speed	of	the	submersible	.
But	it	was	worth	it	,	because	we	caught	it	in	a	special	capture	device	,	brought	it	up	into	the	lab	on	the	ship	,	and	then	everything	on	this	fish	lights	up	.
It	's	unbelievable	.
The	light	organs	under	the	eyes	are	flashing	.
That	chin	barbel	is	flashing	.
It	's	got	light	organs	on	its	belly	that	are	flashing	,	fin	lights	.
It	's	a	scream	for	help	;	it	's	meant	to	attract	attention	.
It	's	phenomenal	.
And	you	normally	do	n't	get	to	see	this	because	we	've	exhausted	the	luminescence	when	we	bring	them	up	in	nets	.
There	's	other	ways	you	can	defend	yourself	with	light	.
For	example	,	this	shrimp	releases	its	bioluminescent	chemicals	into	the	water	just	the	way	a	squid	or	an	octopus	would	release	an	ink	cloud	.
This	blinds	or	distracts	the	predator	.
This	little	squid	is	called	the	fire	shooter	because	of	its	ability	to	do	this	.
Now	it	may	look	like	a	tasty	morsel	,	or	a	pig	's	head	with	wings	--	but	if	it	's	attacked	,	it	puts	out	a	barrage	of	light	--	in	fact	,	a	barrage	of	photon	torpedoes	.
I	just	barely	got	the	lights	out	in	time	for	you	to	be	able	to	see	those	gobs	of	light	hitting	the	transect	screen	and	then	just	glowing	.
It	's	phenomenal	.
So	there	's	a	lot	of	animals	in	the	open	ocean	--	most	of	them	that	make	light	.
And	we	have	a	pretty	good	idea	,	for	most	of	them	,	why	.
They	use	it	for	finding	food	,	for	attracting	mates	,	for	defending	against	predators	.
But	when	you	get	down	to	the	bottom	of	the	ocean	,	that	's	where	things	get	really	strange	.
And	some	of	these	animals	are	probably	inspiration	for	the	things	you	saw	in	``	Avatar	,	''
but	you	do	n't	have	to	travel	to	Pandora	to	see	them	.
They	're	things	like	this	.
This	is	a	golden	coral	,	a	bush	.
It	grows	very	slowly	.
In	fact	,	it	's	thought	that	some	of	these	are	as	much	as	3,000	years	old	,	which	is	one	reason	that	bottom	trawling	should	not	be	allowed	.
The	other	reason	is	this	amazing	bush	glows	.
So	if	you	brush	up	against	it	,	any	place	you	brushed	against	it	,	you	get	this	twinkling	blue-green	light	that	's	just	breathtaking	.
And	you	see	things	like	this	.
This	looks	like	something	out	of	a	Dr.	Seuss	book	--	just	all	manner	of	creatures	all	over	this	thing	.
And	these	are	flytrap	anemones	.
Now	if	you	poke	it	,	it	pulls	in	its	tentacles	.
But	if	you	keep	poking	it	,	it	starts	to	produce	light	.
And	it	actually	ends	up	looking	like	a	galaxy	.
It	produces	these	strings	of	light	,	presumably	as	some	form	of	defense	.
There	are	starfish	that	can	make	light	.
And	there	are	brittle	stars	that	produce	bands	of	light	that	dance	along	their	arms	.
This	looks	like	a	plant	,	but	it	's	actually	an	animal	.
And	it	anchors	itself	in	the	sand	by	blowing	up	a	balloon	on	the	end	of	its	stock	.
So	it	can	actually	hold	itself	in	very	strong	currents	,	as	you	see	here	.
But	if	we	collect	it	very	gently	,	and	we	bring	it	up	into	the	lab	and	just	squeeze	it	at	the	base	of	the	stock	,	it	produces	this	light	that	propagates	from	stem	to	the	plume	,	changing	color	as	it	goes	,	from	green	to	blue	.
Colorization	and	sound	effects	added	for	you	viewing	pleasure	.
But	we	have	no	idea	why	it	does	that	.
Here	's	another	one	.	This	is	also	a	sea	pen	.
It	's	got	a	brittle	star	hitching	a	ride	.
It	's	a	green	saber	of	light	.
And	like	the	one	you	just	saw	,	it	can	produce	these	as	bands	of	light	.
So	if	I	squeeze	the	base	,	the	bands	go	from	base	to	tip	.
If	I	squeeze	the	tip	,	they	go	from	tip	to	base	.
So	what	do	you	think	happens	if	you	squeeze	it	in	the	middle	?
I	'd	be	very	interested	in	your	theories	about	what	that	's	about	.
So	there	's	a	language	of	light	in	the	deep	ocean	,	and	we	're	just	beginning	to	understand	it	,
and	one	way	we	're	going	about	that	is	we	're	imitating	a	lot	of	these	displays	.
This	is	an	optical	lure	that	I	've	used	.
We	call	it	the	electronic	jellyfish	.
It	's	just	16	blue	LEDs	that	we	can	program	to	do	different	types	of	displays	.
And	we	view	it	with	a	camera	system	I	developed	called	Eye-in-the-Sea	that	uses	far	red	light	that	's	invisible	to	most	animals	,	so	it	's	unobtrusive	.
So	I	just	want	to	show	you	some	of	the	responses	we	've	elicited	from	animals	in	the	deep	sea	.
So	the	camera	's	black	and	white	.
It	's	not	high-resolution	.
And	what	you	're	seeing	here	is	a	bait	box	with	a	bunch	of	--	like	the	cockroaches	of	the	ocean	--	there	are	isopods	all	over	it	.
And	right	in	the	front	is	the	electronic	jellyfish	.
And	when	it	starts	flashing	,	it	's	just	going	to	be	one	of	the	LEDs	that	's	flashing	very	fast	.	But	as	soon	as	it	starts	to	flash	--	and	it	's	going	to	look	big	,	because	it	blooms	on	the	camera	--	I	want	you	to	look	right	here	.
There	's	something	small	there	that	responds	.	We	're	talking	to	something	.
It	looks	like	a	little	of	string	pearls	basically	--	in	fact	,	three	strings	of	pearls	.
And	this	was	very	consistent	.
This	was	in	the	Bahamas	at	about	2,000	feet	.
We	basically	have	a	chat	room	going	on	here	,	because	once	it	gets	started	,	everybody	's	talking	.
And	I	think	this	is	actually	a	shrimp	that	's	releasing	its	bioluminescent	chemicals	into	the	water	.
But	the	cool	thing	is	,	we	're	talking	to	it	.
We	do	n't	know	what	we	're	saying	.
Personally	,	I	think	it	's	something	sexy	.
And	then	finally	,	I	want	to	show	you	some	responses	that	we	recorded	with	the	world	's	first	deep-sea	webcam	,	which	we	had	installed	in	Monterey	Canyon	last	year	.
We	've	only	just	begun	to	analyze	all	of	this	data	.
This	is	going	to	be	a	glowing	source	first	,	which	is	like	bioluminescent	bacteria	.
And	it	is	an	optical	cue	that	there	's	carrion	on	the	bottom	of	the	ocean	.
So	this	scavenger	comes	in	,	which	is	a	giant	sixgill	shark	.
And	I	ca	n't	claim	for	sure	that	the	optical	source	brought	it	in	,	because	there	's	bait	right	there	.
But	if	it	had	been	following	the	odor	plume	,	it	would	have	come	in	from	the	other	direction	.
And	it	does	actually	seem	to	be	trying	to	eat	the	electronic	jellyfish	.
That	's	a	12-foot-long	giant	sixgill	shark	.
Okay	,	so	this	next	one	is	from	the	webcam	,	and	it	's	going	to	be	this	pinwheel	display	.
And	this	is	a	burglar	alarm	.
And	that	was	a	Humboldt	squid	,	a	juvenile	Humboldt	squid	,	about	three	feet	long	.
This	is	at	3,000	feet	in	Monterey	Canyon	.
But	if	it	's	a	burglar	alarm	,	you	would	n't	expect	it	to	attack	the	jellyfish	directly	.
It	's	supposed	to	be	attacking	what	's	attacking	the	jellyfish	.
But	we	did	see	a	bunch	of	responses	like	this	.
This	guy	is	a	little	more	contemplative	.
``	Hey	,	wait	a	minute	.
There	's	supposed	to	be	something	else	there	.	''
He	's	thinking	about	it	.
But	he	's	persistent	.
He	keeps	coming	back	.
And	then	he	goes	away	for	a	few	seconds	to	think	about	it	some	more	,	and	thinks	,	``	Maybe	if	I	come	in	from	a	different	angle	.	''
Nope	.
So	we	are	starting	to	get	a	handle	on	this	,	but	only	just	the	beginnings	.
We	need	more	eyes	on	the	process	.
So	if	any	of	you	ever	get	a	chance	to	take	a	dive	in	a	submersible	,	by	all	means	,	climb	in	and	take	the	plunge	.
This	is	something	that	should	be	on	everybody	's	bucket	list	,	because	we	live	on	an	ocean	planet	.
More	than	90	percent	,	99	percent	,	of	the	living	space	on	our	planet	is	ocean	.
It	's	a	magical	place	filled	with	breathtaking	light	shows	and	bizarre	and	wondrous	creatures	,	alien	life	forms	that	you	do	n't	have	to	travel	to	another	planet	to	see	.
But	if	you	do	take	the	plunge	,	please	remember	to	turn	out	the	lights	.
But	I	warn	you	,	it	's	addictive	.
Thank	you	.
What	I	'm	going	to	do	is	to	just	give	a	few	notes	,	and	this	is	from	a	book	I	'm	preparing	called	``	Letters	to	a	Young	Scientist	.	''	I	'd	thought	it	'd	be	appropriate	to	present	it	,	on	the	basis	that	I	have	had	extensive	experience	in	teaching	,	counseling	scientists	across	a	broad	array	of	fields	.
And	you	might	like	to	hear	some	of	the	principles	that	I	've	developed	in	doing	that	teaching	and	counseling	.	So	let	me	begin	by	urging	you	,	particularly	you	on	the	youngsters	'	side	,	on	this	path	you	've	chosen	,	to	go	as	far	as	you	can	.
The	world	needs	you	,	badly	.	Humanity	is	now	fully	into	the	techno-scientific	age	.
There	is	going	to	be	no	turning	back	.	Although	varying	among	disciplines	--	say	,	astrophysics	,	molecular	genetics	,	the	immunology	,	the	microbiology	,	the	public	health	,	to	the	new	area	of	the	human	body	as	a	symbiont	,	to	public	health	,	environmental	science	.
Knowledge	in	medical	science	and	science	overall	is	doubling	every	15	to	20	years	.	Technology	is	increasing	at	a	comparable	rate	.	Between	them	,	the	two	already	pervade	,	as	most	of	you	here	seated	realize	,	every	dimension	of	human	life	.	So	swift	is	the	velocity	of	the	techno-scientific	revolution	,	so	startling	in	its	countless	twists	and	turns	,	that	no	one	can	predict	its	outcome	even	a	decade	from	the	present	moment	.
There	will	come	a	time	,	of	course	,	when	the	exponential	growth	of	discovery	and	knowledge	,	which	actually	began	in	the	1600s	,	has	to	peak	and	level	off	,	but	that	's	not	going	to	matter	to	you	.
The	revolution	is	going	to	continue	for	at	least	several	more	decades	.
It	'll	render	the	human	condition	radically	different	from	what	it	is	today	.
Traditional	fields	of	study	are	going	to	continue	to	grow	and	in	so	doing	,	inevitably	they	will	meet	and	create	new	disciplines	.
In	time	,	all	of	science	will	come	to	be	a	continuum	of	description	,	an	explanation	of	networks	,	of	principles	and	laws	.
That	's	why	you	need	not	just	be	training	in	one	specialty	,	but	also	acquire	breadth	in	other	fields	,	related	to	and	even	distant	from	your	own	initial	choice	.
Keep	your	eyes	lifted	and	your	head	turning	.
The	search	for	knowledge	is	in	our	genes	.	It	was	put	there	by	our	distant	ancestors	who	spread	across	the	world	,	and	it	's	never	going	to	be	quenched	.	To	understand	and	use	it	sanely	,	as	a	part	of	the	civilization	yet	to	evolve	requires	a	vastly	larger	population	of	scientifically	trained	people	like	you	.
In	education	,	medicine	,	law	,	diplomacy	,	government	,	business	and	the	media	that	exist	today	.
Our	political	leaders	need	at	least	a	modest	degree	of	scientific	literacy	,	which	most	badly	lack	today	--	no	applause	,	please	.
It	will	be	better	for	all	if	they	prepare	before	entering	office	rather	than	learning	on	the	job	.
Therefore	you	will	do	well	to	act	on	the	side	,	no	matter	how	far	into	the	laboratory	during	the	span	of	your	career	.
I	'll	now	proceed	quickly	,	and	before	else	,	to	a	subject	that	is	both	a	vital	asset	and	a	potential	barrier	to	a	scientific	career	.
If	you	are	a	bit	short	in	mathematical	skills	,
do	n't	worry	.	Many	of	the	most	successful	scientists	at	work	today	are	mathematically	semi-literate	.
A	metaphor	will	serve	here	:	Where	elite	mathematicians	and	statisticians	and	theorists	often	serve	as	architects	in	the	expanding	realm	of	science	,	the	remaining	large	majority	of	basic	applied	scientists	,	including	a	large	portion	of	those	who	could	be	said	to	be	of	the	first	rank	,	are	the	ones	who	map	the	terrain	,	they	scout	the	frontiers	,	they	cut	the	pathways	,	they	raise	the	buildings	along	the	way	.
Some	may	have	considered	me	foolhardy	,	but	it	's	been	my	habit	to	brush	aside	the	fear	of	mathematics	when	talking	to	candidate	scientists	.	During	41	years	of	teaching	biology	at	Harvard	,	I	watched	sadly	as	bright	students	turned	away	from	the	possibility	of	a	scientific	career	or	even	from	taking	non-required	courses	in	science	because	they	were	afraid	of	failure	.
These	math-phobes	deprive	science	and	medicine	of	immeasurable	amounts	of	badly	needed	talent	.	Here	's	how	to	relax	your	anxieties	,	if	you	have	them	:	Understand	that	mathematics	is	a	language	ruled	like	other	verbal	languages	,	or	like	verbal	language	generally	,	by	its	own	grammar	and	system	of	logic	.
Any	person	with	average	quantitative	intelligence	who	learns	to	read	and	write	mathematics	at	an	elementary	level	will	,	as	in	verbal	language	,	have	little	difficulty	picking	up	most	of	the	fundamentals	if	they	choose	to	master	the	mathspeak	of	most	disciplines	of	science	.
The	longer	you	wait	to	become	at	least	semi-literate	the	harder	the	language	of	mathematics	will	be	to	master	,	just	as	again	in	any	verbal	language	,	but	it	can	be	done	at	any	age	.
I	speak	as	an	authority	on	that	subject	,	because	I	'm	an	extreme	case	.
I	did	n't	take	algebra	until	my	freshman	year	at	the	University	of	Alabama	.
They	did	n't	teach	it	before	then	.
I	finally	got	around	to	calculus	as	a	32-year-old	tenured	professor	at	Harvard	,	where	I	sat	uncomfortably	in	classes	with	undergraduate	students	,	little	more	than	half	my	age	.
A	couple	of	them	were	students	in	a	course	I	was	giving	on	evolutionary	biology	.
I	swallowed	my	pride	,	and	I	learned	calculus	.
I	found	out	that	in	science	and	all	its	applications	,	what	is	crucial	is	not	that	technical	ability	,	but	it	is	imagination	in	all	of	its	applications	.
The	ability	to	form	concepts	with	images	of	entities	and	processes	pictured	by	intuition	.	I	found	out	that	advances	in	science	rarely	come	upstream	from	an	ability	to	stand	at	a	blackboard	and	conjure	images	from	unfolding	mathematical	propositions	and	equations	.
They	are	instead	the	products	of	downstream	imagination	leading	to	hard	work	,	during	which	mathematical	reasoning	may	or	may	not	prove	to	be	relevant	.
Ideas	emerge	when	a	part	of	the	real	or	imagined	world	is	studied	for	its	own	sake	.
Of	foremost	importance	is	a	thorough	,	well-organized	knowledge	of	all	that	is	known	of	the	relevant	entities	and	processes	that	might	be	involved	in	that	domain	you	propose	to	enter	.
When	something	new	is	discovered	,	it	's	logical	then	that	one	of	the	follow-up	steps	is	to	find	the	mathematical	and	statistical	methods	to	move	its	analysis	forward	.
If	that	step	proves	too	difficult	for	the	person	or	team	that	made	the	discovery	,	a	mathematician	can	then	be	added	by	them	as	a	collaborator	.
Consider	the	following	principle	,	which	I	will	modestly	call	Wilson	's	Principle	Number	One	:	It	is	far	easier	for	scientists	including	medical	researchers	,	to	require	needed	collaboration	in	mathematics	and	statistics	than	it	is	for	mathematicians	and	statisticians	to	find	scientists	able	to	make	use	of	their	equations	.
It	is	important	in	choosing	the	direction	to	take	in	science	to	find	the	subject	at	your	level	of	competence	that	interests	you	deeply	,	and	focus	on	that	.
Keep	in	mind	,	then	,	Wilson	's	Second	Principle	:	For	every	scientist	,	whether	researcher	,	technician	,	teacher	,	manager	or	businessman	,	working	at	any	level	of	mathematical	competence	,	there	exists	a	discipline	in	science	or	medicine	for	which	that	level	is	enough	to	achieve	excellence	.
Now	I	'm	going	to	offer	quickly	several	more	principles	that	will	be	useful	in	organizing	your	education	and	career	,	or	if	you	're	teaching	,	how	you	might	enhance	your	own	teaching	and	counseling	of	young	scientists	.
In	selecting	a	subject	in	which	to	conduct	original	research	,	or	to	develop	world-class	expertise	,	take	a	part	of	the	chosen	discipline	that	is	sparsely	inhabited	.
Judge	opportunity	by	how	few	other	students	and	researchers	are	on	hand	.
This	is	not	to	de-emphasize	the	essential	requirement	of	broad	training	,	or	the	value	of	apprenticing	yourself	in	ongoing	research	to	programs	of	high	quality	.
It	is	important	also	to	acquire	older	mentors	within	these	successful	programs	,	and	to	make	friends	and	colleagues	of	your	age	for	mutual	support	.
But	through	it	all	,	look	for	a	way	to	break	out	,	to	find	a	field	and	subject	not	yet	popular	.
We	have	seen	this	demonstrated	already	in	the	talks	preceding	mine	.
There	is	the	quickest	way	advances	are	likely	to	occur	,	as	measured	in	discoveries	per	investigator	per	year	.
You	may	have	heard	the	military	dictum	for	the	gathering	of	armies	:	March	to	the	sound	of	the	guns	.
In	science	,	the	exact	opposite	is	the	case	:	March	away	from	the	sound	of	the	guns	.
So	Wilson	's	Principle	Number	Three	:	March	away	from	the	sound	of	the	guns	.
Observe	from	a	distance	,	but	do	not	join	the	fray	.
Make	a	fray	of	your	own	.
Once	you	have	settled	on	a	specialty	,	and	the	profession	you	can	love	,	and	you	've	secured	opportunity	,	your	potential	to	succeed	will	be	greatly	enhanced	if	you	study	it	enough	to	become	an	expert	.
There	are	thousands	of	professionally	delimited	subjects	sprinkled	through	physics	and	chemistry	to	biology	and	medicine	.	And	on	then	into	the	social	sciences	,	where	it	is	possible	in	short	time	to	acquire	the	status	of	an	authority	.
When	the	subject	is	still	very	thinly	populated	,	you	can	with	diligence	and	hard	work	become	the	world	authority	.	The	world	needs	this	kind	of	expertise	,	and	it	rewards	the	kind	of	people	willing	to	acquire	it	.
The	existing	information	and	what	you	self-discover	may	at	first	seem	skimpy	and	difficult	to	connect	to	other	bodies	of	knowledge	.	Well	,	if	that	's	the	case	,	good	.	Why	hard	instead	of	easy	?
The	answer	deserves	to	be	stated	as	Principle	Number	Four	.
In	the	attempt	to	make	scientific	discoveries	,	every	problem	is	an	opportunity	,	and	the	more	difficult	the	problem	,	the	greater	will	be	the	importance	of	its	solution	.
Now	this	brings	me	to	a	basic	categorization	in	the	way	scientific	discoveries	are	made	.
Scientists	,	pure	mathematicians	among	them	,	follow	one	or	the	other	of	two	pathways	:	First	through	early	discoveries	,	a	problem	is	identified	and	a	solution	is	sought	.
The	problem	may	be	relatively	small	;	for	example	,	where	exactly	in	a	cruise	ship	does	the	norovirus	begin	to	spread	?
Or	larger	,	what	's	the	role	of	dark	matter	in	the	expansion	of	the	universe	?
As	the	answer	is	sought	,	other	phenomena	are	typically	discovered	and	other	questions	are	asked	.
This	first	of	the	two	strategies	is	like	a	hunter	,	exploring	a	forest	in	search	of	a	particular	quarry	,	who	finds	other	quarries	along	the	way	.
The	second	strategy	of	research	is	to	study	a	subject	broadly	searching	for	unknown	phenomena	or	patterns	of	known	phenomena	like	a	hunter	in	what	we	call	``	the	naturalist	's	trance	,	''	the	researcher	of	mind	is	open	to	anything	interesting	,	any	quarry	worth	taking	.
The	search	is	not	for	the	solution	of	the	problem	,	but	for	problems	themselves	worth	solving	.
The	two	strategies	of	research	,	original	research	,	can	be	stated	as	follows	,	in	the	final	principle	I	'm	going	to	offer	you	:	For	every	problem	in	a	given	discipline	of	science	,	there	exists	a	species	or	entity	or	phenomenon	ideal	for	its	solution	.
And	conversely	,	for	every	species	or	other	entity	or	phenomenon	,	there	exist	important	problems	for	the	solution	of	which	,	those	particular	objects	of	research	are	ideally	suited	.
Find	out	what	they	are	.
You	'll	find	your	own	way	to	discover	,	to	learn	,	to	teach	.
The	decades	ahead	will	see	dramatic	advances	in	disease	prevention	,	general	health	,	the	quality	of	life	.	All	of	humanity	depends	on	the	knowledge	and	practice	of	the	medicine	and	the	science	behind	it	you	will	master	.
You	have	chosen	a	calling	that	will	come	in	steps	to	give	you	satisfaction	,	at	its	conclusion	,	of	a	life	well	lived	.
And	I	thank	you	for	having	me	here	tonight	.
Oh	,	thank	you	.
Thank	you	very	much	.
I	salute	you	.
What	I	'm	going	to	show	you	are	the	astonishing	molecular	machines	that	create	the	living	fabric	of	your	body	.
Now	molecules	are	really	,	really	tiny	.
And	by	tiny	,	I	mean	really	.
They	're	smaller	than	a	wavelength	of	light	,	so	we	have	no	way	to	directly	observe	them	.
But	through	science	,	we	do	have	a	fairly	good	idea	of	what	's	going	on	down	at	the	molecular	scale	.
So	what	we	can	do	is	actually	tell	you	about	the	molecules	,	but	we	do	n't	really	have	a	direct	way	of	showing	you	the	molecules	.
One	way	around	this	is	to	draw	pictures	.
And	this	idea	is	actually	nothing	new	.
Scientists	have	always	created	pictures	as	part	of	their	thinking	and	discovery	process	.
They	draw	pictures	of	what	they	're	observing	with	their	eyes	,	through	technology	like	telescopes	and	microscopes	,	and	also	what	they	're	thinking	about	in	their	minds	.
I	picked	two	well-known	examples	,	because	they	're	very	well-known	for	expressing	science	through	art	.
And	I	start	with	Galileo	who	used	the	world	's	first	telescope	to	look	at	the	Moon	.
And	he	transformed	our	understanding	of	the	Moon	.
The	perception	in	the	17th	century	was	the	Moon	was	a	perfect	heavenly	sphere	.
But	what	Galileo	saw	was	a	rocky	,	barren	world	,	which	he	expressed	through	his	watercolor	painting	.
Another	scientist	with	very	big	ideas	,	the	superstar	of	biology	,	is	Charles	Darwin	.
And	with	this	famous	entry	in	his	notebook	,	he	begins	in	the	top	left-hand	corner	with	,	``	I	think	,	''	and	then	sketches	out	the	first	tree	of	life	,	which	is	his	perception	of	how	all	the	species	,	all	living	things	on	Earth	,	are	connected	through	evolutionary	history	--	the	origin	of	species	through	natural	selection	and	divergence	from	an	ancestral	population	.
Even	as	a	scientist	,	I	used	to	go	to	lectures	by	molecular	biologists	and	find	them	completely	incomprehensible	,	with	all	the	fancy	technical	language	and	jargon	that	they	would	use	in	describing	their	work	,	until	I	encountered	the	artworks	of	David	Goodsell	,	who	is	a	molecular	biologist	at	the	Scripps	Institute	.
And	his	pictures	,	everything	's	accurate	and	it	's	all	to	scale	.
And	his	work	illuminated	for	me	what	the	molecular	world	inside	us	is	like	.
So	this	is	a	transection	through	blood	.
In	the	top	left-hand	corner	,	you	've	got	this	yellow-green	area	.
The	yellow-green	area	is	the	fluids	of	blood	,	which	is	mostly	water	,	but	it	's	also	antibodies	,	sugars	,	hormones	,	that	kind	of	thing	.
And	the	red	region	is	a	slice	into	a	red	blood	cell	.
And	those	red	molecules	are	hemoglobin	.
They	are	actually	red	;	that	's	what	gives	blood	its	color	.
And	hemoglobin	acts	as	a	molecular	sponge	to	soak	up	the	oxygen	in	your	lungs	and	then	carry	it	to	other	parts	of	the	body	.
I	was	very	much	inspired	by	this	image	many	years	ago	,	and	I	wondered	whether	we	could	use	computer	graphics	to	represent	the	molecular	world	.
What	would	it	look	like	?
And	that	's	how	I	really	began	.	So	let	's	begin	.
This	is	DNA	in	its	classic	double	helix	form	.
And	it	's	from	X-ray	crystallography	,	so	it	's	an	accurate	model	of	DNA	.
If	we	unwind	the	double	helix	and	unzip	the	two	strands	,	you	see	these	things	that	look	like	teeth	.
Those	are	the	letters	of	genetic	code	,	the	25,000	genes	you	've	got	written	in	your	DNA	.
This	is	what	they	typically	talk	about	--	the	genetic	code	--	this	is	what	they	're	talking	about	.
But	I	want	to	talk	about	a	different	aspect	of	DNA	science	,	and	that	is	the	physical	nature	of	DNA	.
It	's	these	two	strands	that	run	in	opposite	directions	for	reasons	I	ca	n't	go	into	right	now	.
But	they	physically	run	in	opposite	directions	,	which	creates	a	number	of	complications	for	your	living	cells	,	as	you	're	about	to	see	,	most	particularly	when	DNA	is	being	copied	.
And	so	what	I	'm	about	to	show	you	is	an	accurate	representation	of	the	actual	DNA	replication	machine	that	's	occurring	right	now	inside	your	body	,	at	least	2002	biology	.
So	DNA	's	entering	the	production	line	from	the	left-hand	side	,	and	it	hits	this	collection	,	these	miniature	biochemical	machines	,	that	are	pulling	apart	the	DNA	strand	and	making	an	exact	copy	.
So	DNA	comes	in	and	hits	this	blue	,	doughnut-shaped	structure	and	it	's	ripped	apart	into	its	two	strands	.
One	strand	can	be	copied	directly	,	and	you	can	see	these	things	spooling	off	to	the	bottom	there	.
But	things	are	n't	so	simple	for	the	other	strand	because	it	must	be	copied	backwards	.
So	it	's	thrown	out	repeatedly	in	these	loops	and	copied	one	section	at	a	time	,	creating	two	new	DNA	molecules	.
Now	you	have	billions	of	this	machine	right	now	working	away	inside	you	,	copying	your	DNA	with	exquisite	fidelity	.
It	's	an	accurate	representation	,	and	it	's	pretty	much	at	the	correct	speed	for	what	is	occurring	inside	you	.
I	've	left	out	error	correction	and	a	bunch	of	other	things	.
This	was	work	from	a	number	of	years	ago	.
Thank	you	.
This	is	work	from	a	number	of	years	ago	,	but	what	I	'll	show	you	next	is	updated	science	,	it	's	updated	technology	.
So	again	,	we	begin	with	DNA	.
And	it	's	jiggling	and	wiggling	there	because	of	the	surrounding	soup	of	molecules	,	which	I	've	stripped	away	so	you	can	see	something	.
DNA	is	about	two	nanometers	across	,	which	is	really	quite	tiny	.
But	in	each	one	of	your	cells	,	each	strand	of	DNA	is	about	30	to	40	million	nanometers	long	.
So	to	keep	the	DNA	organized	and	regulate	access	to	the	genetic	code	,	it	's	wrapped	around	these	purple	proteins	--	or	I	've	labeled	them	purple	here	.
It	's	packaged	up	and	bundled	up	.
All	this	field	of	view	is	a	single	strand	of	DNA	.
This	huge	package	of	DNA	is	called	a	chromosome	.
And	we	'll	come	back	to	chromosomes	in	a	minute	.
We	're	pulling	out	,	we	're	zooming	out	,	out	through	a	nuclear	pore	,	which	is	the	gateway	to	this	compartment	that	holds	all	the	DNA	called	the	nucleus	.
All	of	this	field	of	view	is	about	a	semester	's	worth	of	biology	,	and	I	've	got	seven	minutes	.
So	we	're	not	going	to	be	able	to	do	that	today	?
No	,	I	'm	being	told	,	``	No	.	''
This	is	the	way	a	living	cell	looks	down	a	light	microscope	.
And	it	's	been	filmed	under	time-lapse	,	which	is	why	you	can	see	it	moving	.
The	nuclear	envelope	breaks	down	.
These	sausage-shaped	things	are	the	chromosomes	,	and	we	'll	focus	on	them	.
They	go	through	this	very	striking	motion	that	is	focused	on	these	little	red	spots	.
When	the	cell	feels	it	's	ready	to	go	,	it	rips	apart	the	chromosome	.
One	set	of	DNA	goes	to	one	side	,	the	other	side	gets	the	other	set	of	DNA	--	identical	copies	of	DNA	.
And	then	the	cell	splits	down	the	middle	.
And	again	,	you	have	billions	of	cells	undergoing	this	process	right	now	inside	of	you	.
Now	we	're	going	to	rewind	and	just	focus	on	the	chromosomes	and	look	at	its	structure	and	describe	it	.
So	again	,	here	we	are	at	that	equator	moment	.
The	chromosomes	line	up	.
And	if	we	isolate	just	one	chromosome	,	we	're	going	to	pull	it	out	and	have	a	look	at	its	structure	.
So	this	is	one	of	the	biggest	molecular	structures	that	you	have	,	at	least	as	far	as	we	've	discovered	so	far	inside	of	us	.
So	this	is	a	single	chromosome	.
And	you	have	two	strands	of	DNA	in	each	chromosome	.
One	is	bundled	up	into	one	sausage	.
The	other	strand	is	bundled	up	into	the	other	sausage	.
These	things	that	look	like	whiskers	that	are	sticking	out	from	either	side	are	the	dynamic	scaffolding	of	the	cell	.
They	're	called	mircrotubules	.	That	name	's	not	important	.
But	what	we	're	going	to	focus	on	is	this	red	region	--	I	've	labeled	it	red	here	--	and	it	's	the	interface	between	the	dynamic	scaffolding	and	the	chromosomes	.
It	is	obviously	central	to	the	movement	of	the	chromosomes	.
We	have	no	idea	really	as	to	how	it	's	achieving	that	movement	.
We	've	been	studying	this	thing	they	call	the	kinetochore	for	over	a	hundred	years	with	intense	study	,	and	we	're	still	just	beginning	to	discover	what	it	's	all	about	.
It	is	made	up	of	about	200	different	types	of	proteins	,	thousands	of	proteins	in	total	.
It	is	a	signal	broadcasting	system	.
It	broadcasts	through	chemical	signals	telling	the	rest	of	the	cell	when	it	's	ready	,	when	it	feels	that	everything	is	aligned	and	ready	to	go	for	the	separation	of	the	chromosomes	.
It	is	able	to	couple	onto	the	growing	and	shrinking	microtubules	.
It	's	involved	with	the	growing	of	the	microtubules	,	and	it	's	able	to	transiently	couple	onto	them	.
It	's	also	an	attention	sensing	system	.
It	's	able	to	feel	when	the	cell	is	ready	,	when	the	chromosome	is	correctly	positioned	.
It	's	turning	green	here	because	it	feels	that	everything	is	just	right	.
And	you	'll	see	,	there	's	this	one	little	last	bit	that	's	still	remaining	red	.
And	it	's	walked	away	down	the	microtubules	.
That	is	the	signal	broadcasting	system	sending	out	the	stop	signal	.
And	it	's	walked	away	.	I	mean	,	it	's	that	mechanical	.
It	's	molecular	clockwork	.
This	is	how	you	work	at	the	molecular	scale	.
So	with	a	little	bit	of	molecular	eye	candy	,	we	've	got	kinesins	,	which	are	the	orange	ones	.
They	're	little	molecular	courier	molecules	walking	one	way	.
And	here	are	the	dynein	.	They	're	carrying	that	broadcasting	system	.
And	they	've	got	their	long	legs	so	they	can	step	around	obstacles	and	so	on	.
So	again	,	this	is	all	derived	accurately	from	the	science	.
The	problem	is	we	ca	n't	show	it	to	you	any	other	way	.
Exploring	at	the	frontier	of	science	,	at	the	frontier	of	human	understanding	,	is	mind-blowing	.
Discovering	this	stuff	is	certainly	a	pleasurable	incentive	to	work	in	science	.
But	most	medical	researchers	--
discovering	the	stuff	is	simply	steps	along	the	path	to	the	big	goals	,	which	are	to	eradicate	disease	,	to	eliminate	the	suffering	and	the	misery	that	disease	causes	and	to	lift	people	out	of	poverty	.
Thank	you	.
I	'm	here	to	enlist	you	in	helping	reshape	the	story	about	how	humans	and	other	critters	get	things	done	.	Here	is	the	old	story	--	we	've	already	heard	a	little	bit	about	it	:
biology	is	war	in	which	only	the	fiercest	survive	;
businesses	and	nations	succeed	only	by	defeating	,	destroying	and	dominating	competition	;
politics	is	about	your	side	winning	at	all	costs	.
But	I	think	we	can	see	the	very	beginnings	of	a	new	story	beginning	to	emerge	.
It	's	a	narrative	spread	across	a	number	of	different	disciplines	,	in	which	cooperation	,	collective	action	and	complex	interdependencies	play	a	more	important	role	.
And	the	central	,	but	not	all-important	,	role	of	competition	and	survival	of	the	fittest	shrinks	just	a	little	bit	to	make	room	.
I	started	thinking	about	the	relationship	between	communication	,	media	and	collective	action	when	I	wrote	``	Smart	Mobs	,	''	and	I	found	that	when	I	finished	the	book	,	I	kept	thinking	about	it	.
In	fact	,	if	you	look	back	,	human	communication	media	and	the	ways	in	which	we	organize	socially	have	been	co-evolving	for	quite	a	long	time	.
Humans	have	lived	for	much	,	much	longer	than	the	approximately	10,000	years	of	settled	agricultural	civilization
in	small	family	groups	.	Nomadic	hunters	bring	down	rabbits	,	gathering	food	.
The	form	of	wealth	in	those	days	was	enough	food	to	stay	alive	.
But	at	some	point	,	they	banded	together	to	hunt	bigger	game	.
And	we	do	n't	know	exactly	how	they	did	this	,
although	they	must	have	solved	some	collective	action	problems	;
it	only	makes	sense	that	you	ca	n't	hunt	mastodons	while	you	're	fighting	with	the	other	groups	.
And	again	,	we	have	no	way	of	knowing	,	but	it	's	clear	that	a	new	form	of	wealth	must	have	emerged	.
More	protein	than	a	hunter	's	family	could	eat	before	it	rotted	.
So	that	raised	a	social	question	that	I	believe	must	have	driven	new	social	forms	.
Did	the	people	who	ate	that	mastodon	meat	owe	something	to	the	hunters	and	their	families	?
And	if	so	,	how	did	they	make	arrangements	?
Again	,	we	ca	n't	know	,	but	we	can	be	pretty	sure	that	some	form	of	symbolic	communication	must	have	been	involved	.
Of	course	,	with	agriculture	came	the	first	big	civilizations	,	the	first	cities	built	of	mud	and	brick	,	the	first	empires	.
And	it	was	the	administers	of	these	empires	who	began	hiring	people	to	keep	track	of	the	wheat	and	sheep	and	wine	that	was	owed	and	the	taxes	that	was	owed	on	them	by	making	marks	;	marks	on	clay	in	that	time	.
Not	too	much	longer	after	that	,	the	alphabet	was	invented	.
And	this	powerful	tool	was	really	reserved	,	for	thousands	of	years	,	for	the	elite	administrators	who	kept	track	of	accounts	for	the	empires	.
And	then	another	communication	technology	enabled	new	media	:
the	printing	press	came	along	,	and	within	decades	,	millions	of	people	became	literate	.
And	from	literate	populations	,	new	forms	of	collective	action	emerged	in	the	spheres	of	knowledge	,	religion	and	politics	.
We	saw	scientific	revolutions	,	the	Protestant	Reformation	,	constitutional	democracies	possible	where	they	had	not	been	possible	before	.
Not	created	by	the	printing	press	,	but	enabled	by	the	collective	action	that	emerges	from	literacy	.
And	again	,	new	forms	of	wealth	emerged	.
Now	,	commerce	is	ancient	.	Markets	are	as	old	as	the	crossroads	.
But	capitalism	,	as	we	know	it	,	is	only	a	few	hundred	years	old	,	enabled	by	cooperative	arrangements	and	technologies	,	such	as	the	joint-stock	ownership	company	,	shared	liability	insurance	,	double-entry	bookkeeping	.
Now	of	course	,	the	enabling	technologies	are	based	on	the	Internet	,
and	in	the	many-to-many	era	,	every	desktop	is	now	a	printing	press	,	a	broadcasting	station	,	a	community	or	a	marketplace	.
Evolution	is	speeding	up	.
More	recently	,	that	power	is	untethering	and	leaping	off	the	desktops	,
and	very	,	very	quickly	,	we	're	going	to	see	a	significant	proportion	,	if	not	the	majority	of	the	human	race	,	walking	around	holding	,	carrying	or	wearing	supercomputers	linked	at	speeds	greater	than	what	we	consider	to	be	broadband	today	.
Now	,	when	I	started	looking	into	collective	action	,	the	considerable	literature	on	it	is	based	on	what	sociologists	call	``	social	dilemmas	.	''
And	there	are	a	couple	of	mythic	narratives	of	social	dilemmas	.
I	'm	going	to	talk	briefly	about	two	of	them	:	the	prisoner	's	dilemma	and	the	tragedy	of	the	commons	.
Now	,	when	I	talked	about	this	with	Kevin	Kelly	,	he	assured	me	that	everybody	in	this	audience	pretty	much	knows	the	details	of	the	prisoner	's	dilemma	,
so	I	'm	just	going	to	go	over	that	very	,	very	quickly	.
If	you	have	more	questions	about	it	,	ask	Kevin	Kelly	later	.
The	prisoner	's	dilemma	is	actually	a	story	that	's	overlaid	on	a	mathematical	matrix	that	came	out	of	the	game	theory	in	the	early	years	of	thinking	about	nuclear	war	:	two	players	who	could	n't	trust	each	other	.
Let	me	just	say	that	every	unsecured	transaction	is	a	good	example	of	a	prisoner	's	dilemma	.
Person	with	the	goods	,	person	with	the	money	,	because	they	ca	n't	trust	each	other	,	are	not	going	to	exchange	.
Neither	one	wants	to	be	the	first	one	or	they	're	going	to	get	the	sucker	's	payoff	,
but	both	lose	,	of	course	,	because	they	do	n't	get	what	they	want	.
If	they	could	only	agree	,	if	they	could	only	turn	a	prisoner	's	dilemma	into	a	different	payoff	matrix	called	an	assurance	game	,	they	could	proceed	.
Twenty	years	ago	,	Robert	Axelrod	used	the	prisoner	's	dilemma	as	a	probe	of	the	biological	question	:	if	we	are	here	because	our	ancestors	were	such	fierce	competitors	,	how	does	cooperation	exist	at	all	?
He	started	a	computer	tournament	for	people	to	submit	prisoner	's	dilemma	strategies	and	discovered	,	much	to	his	surprise	,	that	a	very	,	very	simple	strategy	won	--
it	won	the	first	tournament	,	and	even	after	everyone	knew	it	won	,	it	won	the	second	tournament	--	that	's	known	as	tit	for	tat	.
Another	economic	game	that	may	not	be	as	well	known	as	the	prisoner	's	dilemma	is	the	ultimatum	game	,
and	it	's	also	a	very	interesting	probe	of	our	assumptions	about	the	way	people	make	economic	transactions	.
Here	's	how	the	game	is	played	:	there	are	two	players	;
they	've	never	played	the	game	before	,
they	will	not	play	the	game	again	,	they	do	n't	know	each	other	,
and	they	are	,	in	fact	,	in	separate	rooms	.
First	player	is	offered	a	hundred	dollars	and	is	asked	to	propose	a	split	:	50/50	,	90/10	,
whatever	that	player	wants	to	propose	.	The	second	player	either	accepts	the	split	--	both	players	are	paid	and	the	game	is	over	--
or	rejects	the	split	--	neither	player	is	paid	and	the	game	is	over	.
Now	,	the	fundamental	basis	of	neoclassical	economics	would	tell	you	it	's	irrational	to	reject	a	dollar	because	someone	you	do	n't	know	in	another	room	is	going	to	get	99	.
Yet	in	thousands	of	trials	with	American	and	European	and	Japanese	students	,	a	significant	percentage	would	reject	any	offer	that	's	not	close	to	50/50	.
And	although	they	were	screened	and	did	n't	know	about	the	game	and	had	never	played	the	game	before	,	proposers	seemed	to	innately	know	this	because	the	average	proposal	was	surprisingly	close	to	50/50	.
Now	,	the	interesting	part	comes	in	more	recently	when	anthropologists	began	taking	this	game	to	other	cultures	and	discovered	,	to	their	surprise	,	that	slash-and-burn	agriculturalists	in	the	Amazon	or	nomadic	pastoralists	in	Central	Asia	or	a	dozen	different	cultures	--	each	had	radically	different	ideas	of	what	is	fair	.
Which	suggests	that	instead	of	there	being	an	innate	sense	of	fairness	,	that	somehow	the	basis	of	our	economic	transactions	can	be	influenced	by	our	social	institutions	,	whether	we	know	that	or	not	.
The	other	major	narrative	of	social	dilemmas	is	the	tragedy	of	the	commons	.
Garrett	Hardin	used	it	to	talk	about	overpopulation	in	the	late	1960s	.
He	used	the	example	of	a	common	grazing	area	in	which	each	person	by	simply	maximizing	their	own	flock	led	to	overgrazing	and	the	depletion	of	the	resource	.
He	had	the	rather	gloomy	conclusion	that	humans	will	inevitably	despoil	any	common	pool	resource	in	which	people	can	not	be	restrained	from	using	it	.
Now	,	Elinor	Ostrom	,	a	political	scientist	,	in	1990	asked	the	interesting	question	that	any	good	scientist	should	ask	,
which	is	:	is	it	really	true	that	humans	will	always	despoil	commons	?
So	she	went	out	and	looked	at	what	data	she	could	find	.
She	looked	at	thousands	of	cases	of	humans	sharing	watersheds	,	forestry	resources	,	fisheries	,	and	discovered	that	yes	,	in	case	after	case	,	humans	destroyed	the	commons	that	they	depended	on	.
But	she	also	found	many	instances	in	which	people	escaped	the	prisoner	's	dilemma	;
in	fact	,	the	tragedy	of	the	commons	is	a	multiplayer	prisoner	's	dilemma	.
And	she	said	that	people	are	only	prisoners	if	they	consider	themselves	to	be	.
They	escape	by	creating	institutions	for	collective	action	.
And	she	discovered	,	I	think	most	interestingly	,	that	among	those	institutions	that	worked	,	there	were	a	number	of	common	design
principles	,	and	those	principles	seem	to	be	missing	from	those	institutions	that	do	n't	work	.
I	'm	moving	very	quickly	over	a	number	of	disciplines	.	In	biology	,	the	notions	of	symbiosis	,	group	selection	,	evolutionary	psychology	are	contested	,	to	be	sure	.
But	there	is	really	no	longer	any	major	debate	over	the	fact	that	cooperative	arrangements	have	moved	from	a	peripheral	role	to	a	central	role	in	biology	,	from	the	level	of	the	cell	to	the	level	of	the	ecology	.
And	again	,	our	notions	of	individuals	as	economic	beings	have	been	overturned	.
Rational	self-interest	is	not	always	the	dominating	factor	.
In	fact	,	people	will	act	to	punish	cheaters	,	even	at	a	cost	to	themselves	.
And	most	recently	,	neurophysiological	measures	have	shown	that	people	who	punish	cheaters	in	economic	games	show	activity	in	the	reward	centers	of	their	brain	.
Which	led	one	scientist	to	declare	that	altruistic	punishment	may	be	the	glue	that	holds	societies	together	.
Now	,	I	've	been	talking	about	how	new	forms	of	communication	and	new	media	in	the	past	have	helped	create	new	economic	forms	.
Commerce	is	ancient	.	Markets	are	very	old	.	Capitalism	is	fairly	recent	;
socialism	emerged	as	a	reaction	to	that	.
And	yet	we	see	very	little	talk	about	how	the	next	form	may	be	emerging	.
Jim	Surowiecki	briefly	mentioned	Yochai	Benkler	's	paper	about	open	source	,	pointing	to	a	new	form	of	production	:	peer-to-peer	production	.
I	simply	want	you	to	keep	in	mind	that	if	in	the	past	,	new	forms	of	cooperation	enabled	by	new	technologies	create	new	forms	of	wealth	,	we	may	be	moving	into	yet	another	economic	form	that	is	significantly	different	from	previous	ones	.
Very	briefly	,	let	's	look	at	some	businesses	.	IBM	,	as	you	know	,	HP	,	Sun	--	some	of	the	most	fierce	competitors	in	the	IT	world	are	open	sourcing	their	software	,	are	providing	portfolios	of	patents	for	the	commons	.
Eli	Lilly	--	in	,	again	,	the	fiercely	competitive	pharmaceutical	world	--	has	created	a	market	for	solutions	for	pharmaceutical	problems	.
Toyota	,	instead	of	treating	its	suppliers	as	a	marketplace	,	treats	them	as	a	network	and	trains	them	to	produce	better	,	even	though	they	are	also	training	them	to	produce	better	for	their	competitors	.
Now	none	of	these	companies	are	doing	this	out	of	altruism	;
they	're	doing	it	because	they	're	learning	that	a	certain	kind	of	sharing	is	in	their	self-interest	.
Open	source	production	has	shown	us	that	world-class	software	,	like	Linux	and	Mozilla	,	can	be	created	with	neither	the	bureaucratic	structure	of	the	firm	nor	the	incentives	of	the	marketplace	as	we	've	known	them	.
Google	enriches	itself	by	enriching	thousands	of	bloggers	through	AdSense	.
Amazon	has	opened	its	Application	Programming	Interface	to	60,000	developers	,	countless	Amazon	shops	.
They	're	enriching	others	,	not	out	of	altruism	but	as	a	way	of	enriching	themselves	.
eBay	solved	the	prisoner	's	dilemma	and	created	a	market	where	none	would	have	existed	by	creating	a	feedback	mechanism	that	turns	a	prisoner	's	dilemma	game	into	an	assurance	game	.
Instead	of	,	``	Neither	of	us	can	trust	each	other	,	so	we	have	to	make	suboptimal	moves	,	''	it	's	,	``	You	prove	to	me	that	you	are	trustworthy	and	I	will	cooperate	.	''
Wikipedia	has	used	thousands	of	volunteers	to	create	a	free	encyclopedia	with	a	million	and	a	half	articles	in	200	languages	in	just	a	couple	of	years	.
We	've	seen	that	ThinkCycle	has	enabled	NGOs	in	developing	countries	to	put	up	problems	to	be	solved	by	design	students	around	the	world	,	including	something	that	's	being	used	for	tsunami	relief	right	now	:
it	's	a	mechanism	for	rehydrating	cholera	victims	that	's	so	simple	to	use	it	,	illiterates	can	be	trained	to	use	it	.
BitTorrent	turns	every	downloader	into	an	uploader	,	making	the	system	more	efficient	the	more	it	is	used	.
Millions	of	people	have	contributed	their	desktop	computers	when	they	're	not	using	them	to	link	together	through	the	Internet	into	supercomputing	collectives	that	help	solve	the	protein	folding	problem	for	medical	researchers	--
that	's	Folding	@	home	at	Stanford	--
to	crack	codes	,	to	search	for	life	in	outer	space	.
I	do	n't	think	we	know	enough	yet	.
I	do	n't	think	we	've	even	begun	to	discover	what	the	basic	principles	are	,
but	I	think	we	can	begin	to	think	about	them	.
And	I	do	n't	have	enough	time	to	talk	about	all	of	them	,
but	think	about	self-interest	.
This	is	all	about	self-interest	that	adds	up	to	more	.
In	El	Salvador	,	both	sides	that	withdrew	from	their	civil	war	took	moves	that	had	been	proven	to	mirror	a	prisoner	's	dilemma	strategy	.
In	the	U.S.	,	in	the	Philippines	,	in	Kenya	,	around	the	world	,	citizens	have	self-organized	political	protests	and	get	out	the	vote	campaigns	using	mobile	devices	and	SMS	.
Is	an	Apollo	Project	of	cooperation	possible	?
A	transdisciplinary	study	of	cooperation	?
I	believe	that	the	payoff	would	be	very	big	.
I	think	we	need	to	begin	developing	maps	of	this	territory	so	that	we	can	talk	about	it	across	disciplines	.
And	I	am	not	saying	that	understanding	cooperation	and	sometimes	people	cooperate	to	do	bad	things	--
but	I	will	remind	you	that	a	few	hundred	years	ago	,	people	saw	their	loved	ones	die	from	diseases	they	thought	were	caused	by	sin	or	foreigners	or	evil	spirits	.
Descartes	said	we	need	an	entire	new	way	of	thinking	.
When	the	scientific	method	provided	that	new	way	of	thinking	and	biology	showed	that	microorganisms	caused	disease	,	suffering	was	alleviated	.
What	forms	of	suffering	could	be	alleviated	,	what	forms	of	wealth	could	be	created	if	we	knew	a	little	bit	more	about	cooperation	?
I	do	n't	think	that	this	transdisciplinary	discourse	is	automatically	going	to	happen	;
it	's	going	to	require	effort	.
So	I	enlist	you	to	help	me	get	the	cooperation	project	started	.
Thank	you	.
About	a	year	and	a	half	ago	,	Stephen	Lawler	,	who	also	gave	a	talk	here	at	TED	in	2007	on	Virtual	Earth	,	brought	me	over	to	become	the	architect	of	Bing	Maps	,	which	is	Microsoft	's	online-mapping	effort	.
In	the	past	two	and	a	half	,	we	've	been	very	hard	at	work	on	redefining	the	way	maps	work	online	.
And	we	really	are	seeing	this	in	very	different	terms	from	the	kind	of	mapping	and	direction	site	that	one	is	used	to	.
So	,	the	first	thing	that	you	might	notice	about	the	mapping	site	is	just	the	fluidity	of	the	zooming	and	the	panning	,	which	,	if	you	're	familiar	at	all	with	Seadragon	,	that	's	where	it	comes	from	.
Mapping	is	,	of	course	,	not	just	about	cartography	,	it	's	also	about	imagery	.
So	,	as	we	zoom-in	beyond	a	certain	level	this	resolves	into	a	kind	of	Sim	City-like	virtual	view	at	45	degrees	.
This	can	be	viewed	from	any	of	the	cardinal	directions	to	show	you	the	3D	structure	of	the	city	,	all	the	facades	.
Now	,	we	see	this	space	,	this	three-dimensional	environment	,	as	being	a	canvas	on	which	all	sorts	of	applications	can	play	out	,
and	map	's	directions	are	really	just	one	of	them	.
If	you	click	on	this	,	you	'll	see	some	of	the	ones	that	we	've	put	out	,	just	in	the	past	couple	of	months	since	we	've	launched	.
So	,	for	example	,	a	couple	of	days	after	the	disaster	in	Haiti	,	we	had	an	earthquake	map	that	showed	before	and	after	pictures	from	the	sky	.
This	wonderful	one	which	I	do	n't	have	time	to	show	you	is	taking	hyper-local	blogs	in	real	time	and	mapping	those	stories	,	those	entries	to	the	places	that	are	referred	to	on	the	blogs	.
It	's	wonderful	.
But	I	'm	going	to	show	you	some	more	candy	sort	of	stuff	.
So	,	we	see	the	imagery	,	of	course	,	not	stopping	at	the	sky	.
These	little	green	bubbles	represent	photosynths	that	users	have	made	.
I	'm	not	going	to	dive	into	them	either	,	but	photosynths	are	integrated	into	the	map	.
Everything	that	's	cased	in	blue	is	an	area	where	we	've	taken	imagery	on	the	ground	as	well	.
And	so	,	when	you	fly	down	--	Thank	you	.	When	you	fly	down	to	the	ground	,	and	you	see	this	kind	of	panoramic	imagery	,	the	first	thing	that	you	might	notice	is	that	it	's	not	just	a	picture	,	there	's	just	as	much	three-dimensional	understanding	of	this	environment	as	there	is	of	the	three-dimensional	city	from	above	,	so	if	I	click	on	something	to	get	a	closer	view	of	it	,	then	,	the	fact	that	that	transition	looks	as	it	does	,	is	a	function	of	all	of	that	geometry	,	all	of	that	3D	understanding	behind	this	model	.
Now	,	I	'll	show	you	a	fun	app	that	--	we	've	been	working	on	a	collaboration	with	our	friends	at	Flickr	.
This	takes	Flickr	,	georegistered	imagery	and	uses	photosynth-like	processes	to	connect	that	imagery	to	our	imagery	,	so	--	I	'm	not	sure	if	that	's	the	one	I	actually	meant	to	pull	up	,	but	--	But	notice	--	this	is	,	of	course	,	a	popular	tourist	site	,	and	there	are	lots	of	photos	around	here	,	and	these	photos	are	all	taken	at	different	times	.
So	this	one	was	taken	around	five	.
So	that	's	the	Flickr	photo	,	that	's	our	imagery	.
So	you	really	see	how	this	kind	of	crowd-sourced	imagery	is	integrating	,	in	a	very	deep	way	,	into	the	map	itself	.
Thank	you	.
There	are	several	reasons	why	this	is	interesting	and	one	of	them	,	of	course	,	is	time	travel	.
And	I	'm	not	going	to	show	you	some	of	the	wonderful	historic	imagery	in	here	,	but	there	are	some	with	horses	and	carriages	and	so	on	as	well	.
But	what	's	cool	about	this	is	that	,	not	only	is	it	augmenting	this	visual	representation	of	the	world	with	things	that	are	coming	in	from	users	,	but	it	also	is	the	foundation	for	augmented	reality	,	and	that	's	something	that	I	'll	be	showing	you	more	of	in	just	a	moment	.
Now	I	just	made	a	transition	indoors	.	That	's	also	interesting	.
OK	,	notice	there	's	now	a	roof	above	us	.
We	're	inside	the	Pike	Place	Market	.
And	this	is	something	that	we	're	able	to	do	with	a	backpack	camera	,
so	,	we	're	now	not	only	imaging	in	the	street	with	this	camera	on	tops	of	cars	,	but	we	're	also	imaging	inside	.
And	from	here	,	we	're	able	to	do	the	same	sorts	of	registration	,	not	only	of	still	images	,	but	also	of	video	.
So	this	is	something	that	we	're	now	going	to	try	for	the	first	time	,	live	,	and	this	is	really	,	truly	,	very	frightening	.
OK	.
All	right	,	guys	,	are	you	there	?
All	right	.	I	'm	hitting	it	.	I	'm	punching	play	.
I	'm	live	.	All	right	.	There	we	go	.
So	,	these	are	our	friends	in	Pike	Place	Market	,	the	lab	.
So	they	're	broadcasting	this	live	.
OK	,	George	,	can	you	pan	back	over	to	the	corner	market	?
Because	I	want	to	show	points	of	interest	.
No	,	no	.	The	other	way	.
Yeah	,	yeah	,	back	to	the	corner	,	back	to	the	corner	.
I	do	n't	want	to	see	you	guys	yet	.
OK	,	OK	,	back	to	the	corner	,	back	to	the	corner	,	back	to	the	corner	.
OK	,	never	mind	.
What	I	wanted	to	show	you	was	these	points	of	interest	over	here	on	top	of	the	image	because	what	that	gives	you	a	sense	of	is	the	way	,	if	you	're	actually	on	the	spot	,
you	can	think	about	this	--	this	is	taking	a	step	in	addition	to	augmented	reality	.
What	the	hell	are	you	guys	--	oh	,	sorry	.
We	're	doing	two	different	--
OK	,	I	'm	hanging	up	now	.
We	're	doing	two	different	things	here	.
One	of	them	is	to	take	that	real	...
All	right	,	let	me	just	take	a	moment	and	thank	the	team	.
They	've	done	a	fantastic	job	of	pulling	this	together	.
I	'm	going	to	abandon	them	now	and	walk	back	outside	.
And	while	I	walk	outside	,	I	'll	just	mention	that	here	we	're	using	this	for	telepresence	,	but	you	can	equally	well	use	this	on	the	spot	,	for	augmented	reality	.
When	you	use	it	on	the	spot	,	it	means	that	you	're	able	to	bring	all	of	that	metadata	and	information	about	the	world	to	you	.
So	here	,	we	're	taking	the	extra	step	of	also	broadcasting	it	.
That	was	being	broadcast	,	by	the	way	,	on	a	4G	network	from	the	market	.
All	right	,	and	now	there	's	one	last	TED	talk	that	Microsoft	has	given	in	the	past	several	years	.
And	that	's	Curtis	Wong	,	WorldWide	Telescope	.
So	,	we	're	going	to	head	over	to	the	dumpsters	,	where	it	's	traditional	,	after	a	long	day	at	the	market	,	to	go	out	for	a	break	,	but	also	stare	up	at	the	sky	.
This	is	the	integration	of	WorldWide	Telescope	into	our	maps	.
This	is	the	current	--	thank	you	--	this	is	the	current	time	.	If	we	scrub	the	time	,	then	we	can	see	how	the	sky	will	look	at	different	times	,	and	we	can	get	all	of	this	very	detailed	information	about	different	times	,	different	dates	:
Let	's	move	the	moon	a	little	higher	in	the	sky	,	maybe	change	the	date	.
I	would	like	to	kind	of	zoom	in	on	the	moon	.
So	,	this	is	an	astronomically	complete	representation	of	the	sky	integrated	right	into	the	Earth	.
All	right	now	,	I	've	overrun	my	time	,	so	I	've	got	to	stop	.
Thank	you	all	very	much	.
I	normally	teach	courses	on	how	to	rebuild	states	after	war	.
But	today	I	've	got	a	personal	story	to	share	with	you	.
This	is	a	picture	of	my	family	,	my	four	siblings	--	my	mom	and	I	--	taken	in	1977	.
And	we	're	actually	Cambodians	.
And	this	picture	is	taken	in	Vietnam	.
So	how	did	a	Cambodian	family	end	up	in	Vietnam	in	1977	?
Well	to	explain	that	,	I	've	got	a	short	video	clip	to	explain	the	Khmer	Rouge	regime	during	1975	and	1979	.
Video	:	April	17th	,	1975	.
The	communist	Khmer	Rouge	enters	Phnom	Penh	to	liberate	their	people	from	the	encroaching	conflict	in	Vietnam	,	and	American	bombing	campaigns	.
Led	by	peasant-born	Pol	Pot	,	the	Khmer	Rouge	evacuates	people	to	the	countryside	in	order	to	create	a	rural	communist	utopia	,	much	like	Mao	Tse-tung	's	Cultural	Revolution	in	China	.
The	Khmer	Rouge	closes	the	doors	to	the	outside	world	.
But	after	four	years	the	grim	truth	seeps	out	.
In	a	country	of	only	seven	million	people	,	one	and	a	half	million	were	murdered	by	their	own	leaders	,	their	bodies	piled	in	the	mass	graves	of	the	killing	fields	.
Sophal	Ear	:	So	,	notwithstanding	the	1970s	narration	,	on	April	17th	1975	we	lived	in	Phnom	Penh	.
And	my	parents	were	told	by	the	Khmer	Rouge	to	evacuate	the	city	because	of	impending	American	bombing	for	three	days	.
And	here	is	a	picture	of	the	Khmer	Rouge	.
They	were	young	soldiers	,	typically	child	soldiers	.
And	this	is	very	normal	now	,	of	modern	day	conflict	,
because	they	're	easy	to	bring	into	wars	.
The	reason	that	they	gave	about	American	bombing	was	n't	all	that	far	off	.
I	mean	,	from	1965	to	1973	there	were	more	munitions	that	fell	on	Cambodia	than	in	all	of	World	War	II	Japan	,	including	the	two	nuclear	bombs	of	August	1945	.
The	Khmer	Rouge	did	n't	believe	in	money	.
So	the	equivalent	of	the	Federal	Reserve	Bank	in	Cambodia	was	bombed	.
But	not	just	that	,	they	actually	banned	money	.
I	think	it	's	the	only	precedent	in	which	money	has	ever	been	stopped	from	being	used	.
And	we	know	money	is	the	root	of	all	evil	,	but	it	did	n't	actually	stop	evil	from	happening	in	Cambodia	,	in	fact	.
My	family	was	moved	from	Phnom	Penh	to	Pursat	province	.
This	is	a	picture	of	what	Pursat	looks	like	.
It	's	actually	a	very	pretty	area	of	Cambodia	,	where	rice	growing	takes	place	.
And	in	fact	they	were	forced	to	work	the	fields	.
So	my	father	and	mother	ended	up	in	a	sort	of	concentration	camp	,	labor	camp	.
And	it	was	at	that	time	that	my	mother	got	word	from	the	commune	chief	that	the	Vietnamese	were	actually	asking	for	their	citizens	to	go	back	to	Vietnam	.
And	she	spoke	some	Vietnamese	,	as	a	child	having	grown	up	with	Vietnamese	friends	.
And	she	decided	,	despite	the	advice	of	her	neighbors	,	that	she	would	take	the	chance	and	claim	to	be	Vietnamese	so	that	we	could	have	a	chance	to	survive	,
because	at	this	point	they	're	forcing	everybody	to	work	.
And	they	're	giving	about	--	in	a	modern-day	,	caloric-restriction	diet	,	I	guess	--	they	're	giving	porridge	,	with	a	few	grains	of	rice	.
And	at	about	this	time	actually	my	father	got	very	sick	.
And	he	did	n't	speak	Vietnamese	.
So	he	died	actually	,	in	January	1976	.
And	it	made	it	possible	,	in	fact	,	for	us	to	take	on	this	plan	.
So	the	Khmer	Rouge	took	us	from	a	place	called	Pursat	to	Kaoh	Tiev	,
which	is	across	from	the	border	from	Vietnam	.
And	there	they	had	a	detention	camp	where	alleged	Vietnamese	would	be	tested	,	language	tested	.
And	my	mother	's	Vietnamese	was	so	bad	that	to	make	our	story	more	credible	,	she	'd	given	all	the	boys	and	girls	new	Vietnamese	names	.
But	she	'd	given	the	boys	girls	'	names	,	and	the	girls	boys	'	names	.
And	it	was	n't	until	she	met	a	Vietnamese	lady	who	told	her	this	,	and	then	tutored	her	for	two	days	intensively	,	that	she	was	able	to	go	into	her	exam	and	--	you	know	,	this	was	a	moment	of	truth	.
If	she	fails	,	we	're	all	headed	to	the	gallows	;
if	she	passes	,	we	can	leave	to	Vietnam	.
And	she	actually	,	of	course	--	I	'm	here	,	she	passes	.
And	we	end	up	in	Hong	Ngu	on	the	Vietnamese	side	.
And	then	onwards	to	Chau	Doc	.
And	this	is	a	picture	of	Hong	Ngu	,	Vietnam	today	.
A	pretty	idyllic	place	on	the	Mekong	Delta	.
But	for	us	it	meant	freedom	.
And	freedom	from	persecution	from	the	Khmer	Rouge	.
Last	year	,	the	Khmer	Rouge	Tribunal	,	which	the	U.N.	is	helping	Cambodia	take	on	,	started	,	and	I	decided	that	as	a	matter	of	record	I	should	file	a	Civil	Complaint	with	the	Tribunal	about	my	father	's	passing	away	.
And	I	got	word	last	month	that	the	complaint	was	officially	accepted	by	the	Khmer	Rouge	Tribunal	.
And	it	's	for	me	a	matter	of	justice	for	history	,	and	accountability	for	the	future	,
because	Cambodia	remains	a	pretty	lawless	place	,	at	times	.
Five	years	ago	my	mother	and	I	went	back	to	Chau	Doc	.
And	she	was	able	to	return	to	a	place	that	for	her	meant	freedom	,	but	also	fear	,	because	we	had	just	come	out	of	Cambodia	.
I	'm	happy	,	actually	,	today	,	to	present	her	.
She	's	here	today	with	us	in	the	audience	.
Thank	you	mother	.
So	I	want	to	tell	you	a	story	--	an	encouraging	story	--	about	addressing	desperation	,	depression	and	despair	in	Afghanistan	,	and	what	we	have	learned	from	it	,	and	how	to	help	people	to	overcome	traumatic	experiences	and	how	to	help	them	to	regain	some	confidence	in	the	time	ahead	--	in	the	future	--	and	how	to	participate	again	in	everyday	life	.
So	,	I	am	a	Jungian	psychoanalyst	,	and	I	went	to	Afghanistan	in	January	2004	,	by	chance	,	on	an	assignment	for	Medica	Mondiale	.
Jung	in	Afghanistan	--	you	get	the	picture	.
Afghanistan	is	one	of	the	poorest	countries	in	the	world	,	and	70	percent	of	the	people	are	illiterate	.
War	and	malnutrition	kills	people	together	with	hope	.
You	may	know	this	from	the	media	,
but	what	you	may	not	know	is	that	the	average	age	of	the	Afghan	people	is	17	years	old	,	which	means	they	grow	up	in	such	an	environment	and	--	I	repeat	myself	--	in	30	years	of	war	.
So	this	translates	into	ongoing	violence	,	foreign	interests	,	bribery	,	drugs	,	ethnic	conflicts	,	bad	health	,	shame	,	fear	and	cumulative	traumatic	experiences	.
Local	and	foreign	military	are	supposed	to	build	peace	together	with	the	donors	and	the	governmental	and	non-governmental	organizations	.
And	people	had	hope	,	yes	,	but	until	they	realized	their	situation	worsens	every	day	--	either	because	they	are	being	killed	or	because	,	somehow	,	they	are	poorer	than	eight	years	ago	.
One	figure	for	that	:	54	percent	of	the	children	under	the	age	of	five	years	suffer	from	malnutrition	.
Yet	,	there	is	hope	.
One	day	a	man	told	me	,	``	My	future	does	not	look	brilliant	,	but	I	want	to	have	a	brilliant	future	for	my	son	.	''
This	is	a	picture	I	took	in	2005	,	walking	on	Fridays	over	the	hills	in	Kabul	,
and	for	me	it	's	a	symbolic	picture	of	an	open	future	for	a	young	generation	.
So	,	doctors	prescribe	medication	.
And	donors	are	supposed	to	bring	peace	by	building	schools	and	roads	.
Military	collect	weapons	,	and	depression	stays	intact	.
Why	?
Because	people	do	n't	have	tools	to	cope	with	it	,	to	get	over	it	.
So	,	soon	after	my	arrival	,	I	had	confirmed	something	which	I	had	already	known	;	that	my	instruments	come	from	the	heart	of	modern	Europe	,	yes	.
However	,	what	can	wound	us	and	our	reaction	to	those	wounds	--	they	are	universal	.
And	the	big	challenge	was	how	to	understand	the	meaning	of	the	symptom	in	this	specific	cultural	context	.
After	a	counseling	session	,	a	woman	said	to	me	,	``	Because	you	have	felt	me	,	I	can	feel	myself	again	,	and	I	want	to	participate	again	in	my	family	life	.	''
This	was	very	important	,	because	the	family	is	central	in	Afghans	'	social	system	.
No	one	can	survive	alone	.
And	if	people	feel	used	,	worthless	and	ashamed	,	because	something	horrible	has	happened	to	them	,	then	they	retreat	,	and	they	fall	into	social	isolation	,	and	they	do	not	dare	to	tell	this	evil	to	other	people	or	to	their	loved	ones	,	because	they	do	not	want	to	burden	them	.
And	very	often	violence	is	a	way	to	cope	with	it	.
Traumatized	people	also	easily	lose	control	--	symptoms	are	hyper-arousal	and	memory	flashbacks	--	so	people	are	in	a	constant	fear	that	those	horrible	feelings	of	that	traumatic	event	might	come	back	unexpectedly	,	suddenly	,	and	they	can	not	control	it	.
To	compensate	this	loss	of	inner	control	,	they	try	to	control	the	outside	,	very	understandably	--	mostly	the	family	--	and	unfortunately	,	this	fits	very	well	into	the	traditional	side	,	regressive	side	,	repressive	side	,	restrictive	side	of	the	cultural	context	.
So	,	husbands	start	beating	wives	,	mothers	and	fathers	beat	their	children	,	and	afterward	,	they	feel	awful	.
They	did	not	want	to	do	this	,	it	just	happened	--
they	lost	control	.
The	desperate	try	to	restore	order	and	normality	,	and	if	we	are	not	able	to	cut	this	circle	of	violence	,	it	will	be	transferred	to	the	next	generation	without	a	doubt	.
And	partly	this	is	already	happening	.
So	everybody	needs	a	sense	for	the	future	,
and	the	Afghan	sense	of	the	future	is	shattered	.
But	let	me	repeat	the	words	of	the	woman	.	``	Because	you	have	felt	me	,	I	can	feel	myself	again	.	''
So	the	key	here	is	empathy	.
Somebody	has	to	be	a	witness	to	what	has	happened	to	you	.
Somebody	has	to	feel	how	you	felt	.
And	somebody	has	to	see	you	and	listen	to	you	.
Everybody	must	be	able	to	know	what	he	or	she	has	experienced	is	true	,
and	this	only	goes	with	another	person	.
So	everybody	must	be	able	to	say	,	``	This	happened	to	me	,	and	it	did	this	with	me	,	but	I	'm	able	to	live	with	it	,	to	cope	with	it	,	and	to	learn	from	it	.
And	I	want	to	engage	myself	in	the	bright	future	for	my	children	and	the	children	of	my	children	,	and	I	will	not	marry-off	my	13	year-old	daughter	,	''	--	what	happens	too	often	in	Afghanistan	.
So	something	can	be	done	,	even	in	such	extreme	environments	as	Afghanistan	.
And	I	started	thinking	about	a	counseling	program	.
But	,	of	course	,	I	needed	help	and	funds	.
And	one	evening	,	I	was	sitting	next	to	a	very	nice	gentleman	in	Kabul	,	and	he	asked	what	I	thought	would	be	good	in	Afghanistan	.
And	I	explained	to	him	quickly	,	I	would	train	psycho-social	counselors	,	I	would	open	centers	,	and	I	explained	to	him	why	.
This	man	gave	me	his	contact	details	at	the	end	of	the	evening	and	said	,	``	If	you	want	to	do	this	,	call	me	.	''
At	that	time	,	it	was	the	head	of	Caritas	Germany	.
So	,	I	was	able	to	launch	a	three-year	project	with	Caritas	Germany	,	and	we	trained	30	Afghan	women	and	men	,	and	we	opened	15	counseling	centers	in	Kabul	.
This	was	our	sign	--	it	's	hand-painted	,
and	we	had	45	all	over	Kabul	.
Eleven	thousand	people	came	--	more	than	that	.
And	70	percent	regained	their	lives	.
This	was	a	very	exciting	time	,	developing	this	with	my	wonderful	Afghan	team	.
And	they	are	working	with	me	up	to	today	.
We	developed	a	culturally-sensitive	psycho-social	counseling	approach	.
So	,	from	2008	up	until	today	,	a	substantial	change	and	step	forward	has	been	taking	place	.
The	European	Union	delegation	in	Kabul	came	into	this	and	hired	me	to	work	inside	the	Ministry	of	Public	Health	,	to	lobby	this	approach	--
we	succeeded	.
We	revised	the	mental	health	component	of	the	primary	health	care	services	by	adding	psycho-social	care	and	psycho-social	counselors	to	the	system	.
This	means	,	certainly	,	to	retrain	all	health	staff	.
But	for	that	,	we	already	have	the	training	manuals	,	which	are	approved	by	the	Ministry	and	moreover	,	this	approach	is	now	part	of	the	mental	health	strategy	in	Afghanistan	.
So	we	also	have	implemented	it	already	in	some	selected	clinics	in	three	provinces	,	and	you	are	the	first	to	see	the	results	.
We	wanted	to	know	if	what	is	being	done	is	effective	.
And	here	you	can	see	the	patients	all	had	symptoms	of	depression	,	moderate	and	severe	.
And	the	red	line	is	the	treatment	as	usual	--	medication	with	a	medical	doctor	.
And	all	the	symptoms	stayed	the	same	or	even	got	worse	.
And	the	green	line	is	treatment	with	psycho-social	counseling	only	,	without	medication	.
And	you	can	see	the	symptoms	almost	completely	go	away	,	and	the	psycho-social	stress	has	dropped	significantly	,	which	is	explicable	,	because	you	can	not	take	away	the	psycho-social	stresses	,	but	you	can	learn	how	to	cope	with	them	.
So	this	makes	us	very	happy	,	because	now	we	also	have	some	evidence	that	this	is	working	.
So	here	you	see	,	this	is	a	health	facility	in	Northern	Afghanistan	,	and	every	morning	it	looks	like	this	all	over	.
And	doctors	usually	have	three	to	six	minutes	for	the	patients	,
but	now	this	will	change	.
They	go	to	the	clinics	,	because	they	want	to	cure	their	immediate	symptoms	,	and	they	will	find	somebody	to	talk	to	and	discuss	these	issues	and	talk	about	what	is	burdening	them	and	find	solutions	,	develop	their	resources	,	learn	tools	to	solve	their	family	conflicts	and	gain	some	confidence	in	the	future	.
And	I	would	like	to	share	one	short	vignette	.
One	Hazara	said	to	his	Pashtun	counselor	,	``	If	we	were	to	have	met	some	years	ago	,	then	we	would	have	killed	each	other	.
And	now	you	are	helping	me	to	regain	some	confidence	in	the	future	.	''
And	another	counselor	said	to	me	after	the	training	,	``	You	know	,	I	never	knew	why	I	survived	the	killings	in	my	village	,
but	now	I	know	,	because	I	am	part	of	a	nucleus	of	a	new	peaceful	society	in	Afghanistan	.	''
So	I	believe	this	kept	me	running	.
And	this	is	a	really	emancipatory	and	political	contribution	to	peace	and	reconciliation	.
And	also	--	I	think	--	without	psycho-social	therapy	,	and	without	considering	this	in	all	humanitarian	projects	,	we	can	not	build-up	civil	societies	.
I	thought	it	was	an	idea	worth	spreading	,	and	I	think	it	must	be	,	can	be	,	could	be	replicated	elsewhere	.
I	thank	you	for	your	attention	.
Chris	Anderson	:	Let	's	now	see	the	extraordinary	speech	that	we	captured	a	couple	weeks	ago	.
Jose	Antonio	Abreu	:	My	dear	friends	,	ladies	and	gentlemen	,	I	am	overjoyed	today	at	being	awarded	the	TED	Prize	on	behalf	of	all	the	distinguished	music	teachers	,	artists	and	educators	from	Venezuela	who	have	selflessly	and	loyally	accompanied	me	for	35	years	in	founding	,	growing	and	developing	in	Venezuela	the	National	System	of	Youth	and	Children	's	Orchestras	and	Choirs	.
Since	I	was	a	boy	,	in	my	early	childhood	,	I	always	wanted	to	be	a	musician	,
and	,	thank	God	,	I	made	it	.
From	my	teachers	,	my	family	and	my	community	,	I	had	all	the	necessary	support	to	become	a	musician	.
All	my	life	I	've	dreamed	that	all	Venezuelan	children	have	the	same	opportunity	that	I	had	.
From	that	desire	and	from	my	heart	stemmed	the	idea	to	make	music	a	deep	and	global	reality	for	my	country	.
From	the	very	first	rehearsal	,	I	saw	the	bright	future	ahead	.
Because	the	rehearsal	meant	a	great	challenge	to	me	.
I	had	received	a	donation	of	50	music	stands	to	be	used	by	100	boys	in	that	rehearsal	.
When	I	arrived	at	the	rehearsal	,	only	11	kids	had	shown	up	,	and	I	said	to	myself	,	``	Do	I	close	the	program	or	multiply	these	kids	?	''
I	decided	to	face	the	challenge	,	and	on	that	same	night	,	I	promised	those	11	children	I	'd	turn	our	orchestra	into	one	of	the	leading	orchestras	in	the	world	.
Two	months	ago	,	I	remembered	that	promise	I	made	,	when	a	distinguished	English	critic	published	an	article	in	the	London	Times	,	asking	who	could	be	the	winner	of	the	Orchestra	World	Cup	.
He	mentioned	four	great	world	orchestras	,	and	the	fifth	one	was	Venezuela	's	Youth	Symphony	Orchestra	.
Today	we	can	say	that	art	in	Latin	America	is	no	longer	a	monopoly	of	elites	and	that	it	has	become	a	social	right	,	a	right	for	all	the	people	.
Child	:	There	is	no	difference	here	between	classes	,	nor	white	or	black	,	nor	if	you	have	money	or	not	.
Simply	,	if	you	are	talented	,	if	you	have	the	vocation	and	the	will	to	be	here	,	you	get	in	.	You	share	with	us	and	make	music	.
JA	:	During	the	recent	tour	by	the	Simon	Bolivar	Youth	Orchestra	of	Venezuela	of	U.S.	and	Europe	,	we	saw	how	our	music	moved	young	audiences	to	the	bottom	of	their	souls	,	how	children	and	adolescents	rushed	up	to	the	stage	to	receive	the	jackets	from	our	musicians	,	how	the	standing	ovations	,	sometimes	30	minutes	long	,	seemed	to	last	forever	,	and	how	the	public	,	after	the	concert	was	over	,	went	out	into	the	street	to	greet	our	young	people	in	triumph	.
This	meant	not	only	an	artistic	triumph	,	but	also	a	profound	emotional	sympathy	between	the	public	of	the	most	advanced	nations	of	the	world	and	the	musical	youth	of	Latin	America	,	as	seen	in	Venezuela	,	giving	these	audiences	a	message	of	music	,	vitality	,	energy	,	enthusiasm	and	strength	.
In	its	essence	,	the	orchestra	and	the	choir	are	much	more	than	artistic	structures	.	They	are	examples	and	schools	of	social	life	,	because	to	sing	and	to	play	together	means	to	intimately	coexist	toward	perfection	and	excellence	,	following	a	strict	discipline	of	organization	and	coordination	in	order	to	seek	the	harmonic	interdependence
of	voices	and	instruments	.
That	's	how	they	build	a	spirit	of	solidarity	and	fraternity	among	them	,	develop	their	self-esteem	and	foster	the	ethical	and	aesthetical	values
related	to	the	music	in	all	its	senses	.
This	is	why	music	is	immensely	important	in	the	awakening	of	sensibility	,	in	the	forging	of	values	and	in	the	training	of	youngsters
to	teach	other	kids	.
Child	:	After	all	this	time	here	,	music	is	life	.	Nothing	else	.
Music	is	life	.
JA	:	Each	teenager	and	child	in	El	Sistema	has	his	own	story	,	and	they	are	all	important	and	of	great	significance	to	me	.
Let	me	mention	the	case	of	Edicson	Ruiz	.
He	is	a	boy	from	a	parish	in	Caracas	who	passionately	attended	to	his	double	bass	lessons	at	the	San	Agustin	's	Junior	Orchestra	.
With	his	effort	,	and	the	support	of	his	mother	,	his	family	and	his	community	,	he	became	a	principal	member	in	the	double	bass	segment	of	the	Berlin	Philharmonic	Orchestra	.
We	have	another	well-known	case	--	Gustavo	Dudamel	.
He	started	as	a	boy	member	of	the	children	's	orchestra	in	his	hometown	,	Barquisimeto	.
There	,	he	grew	as	a	violinist	and	as	a	conductor	.
He	became	the	conductor	of	Venezuela	's	junior	orchestras	,	and	today	conducts	the	world	's	greatest	orchestras	.
He	is	the	musical	director	of	Los	Angeles	Philharmonic	,	and	is	still	the	overall	leader	of	Venezuela	's	junior	orchestras	.
He	was	the	conductor	of	the	Gothenburg	Symphony	Orchestra	,	and	he	's	an	unbeatable	example	for	young	musicians	in	Latin	America	and	the	world	.
The	structure	of	El	Sistema	is	based	on	a	new	and	flexible	managing	style	adapted	to	the	features	of	each	community	and	region	,	and	today	attends	to	300,000	children	of	the	lower	and	middle	class	all	over	Venezuela	.
It	's	a	program	of	social	rescue	and	deep	cultural	transformation	designed	for	the	whole	Venezuelan	society	with	absolutely	no	distinctions	whatsoever	,	but	emphasizing	the	vulnerable	and	endangered	social	groups	.
The	effect	of	El	Sistema	is	felt	in	three	fundamental	circles	:	in	the	personal/social	circle	,
in	the	family	circle	and	in	the	community	.
In	the	personal/social	circle	,	the	children	in	the	orchestras	and	choirs	develop	their	intellectual	and	emotional	side	.
The	music	becomes	a	source	for	developing	the	dimensions	of	the	human	being	,	thus	elevating	the	spirit	and	leading	man	to	a	full	development	of	his	personality	.
So	,	the	emotional	and	intellectual	profits	are	huge	--	the	acquisition	of	leadership	,	teaching	and	training	principles	,	the	sense	of	commitment	,	responsibility	,	generosity	and	dedication	to	others	,	and	the	individual	contribution	to	achieve	great	collective	goals	.
All	this	leads	to	the	development	of	self-esteem	and	confidence	.
Mother	Teresa	of	Calcutta	insisted	on	something	that	always	impressed	me	:	the	most	miserable	and	tragic	thing	about	poverty	is	not	the	lack	of	bread	or	roof	,	but	the	feeling	of	being	no-one	--	the	feeling	of	not	being	anyone	,	the	lack	of	identification	,	the	lack	of	public	esteem	.
That	's	why	the	child	's	development	in	the	orchestra	and	the	choir	provides	him	with	a	noble	identity	and	makes	him	a	role	model	for	his	family	and	community	.
It	makes	him	a	better	student	at	school	because	it	inspires	in	him	a	sense	of	responsibility	,	perseverance	and	punctuality	that	will	greatly	help	him	at	school	.
Within	the	family	,	the	parents	'	support	is	unconditional	.
The	child	becomes	a	role	model	for	both	his	parents	,	and	this	is	very	important	for	a	poor	child	.
Once	the	child	discovers	he	is	important	to	his	family	,	he	begins	to	seek	new	ways	of	improving	himself	and	hopes	better	for	himself	and	his	community	.
Also	,	he	hopes	for	social	and	economic	improvements	for	his	own	family	.
All	this	makes	up	a	constructive	and	ascending	social	dynamic	.
The	large	majority	of	our	children	belong	,	as	I	already	mentioned	,	to	the	most	vulnerable	strata	of	the	Venezuelan	population	.
That	encourages	them	to	embrace	new	dreams	,	new	goals	,	and	progress	in	the	various	opportunities
that	music	has	to	offer	.
Finally	,	in	the	circle	of	the	community	,	the	orchestras	prove	to	be	the	creative	spaces	of	culture	and	sources	of	exchange	and	new	meanings	.
The	spontaneity	music	has	excludes	it	as	a	luxury	item	and	makes	it	a	patrimony	of	society	.
It	's	what	makes	a	child	play	a	violin	at	home	,	while	his	father	works	in	his	carpentry	.
It	's	what	makes	a	little	girl	play	the	clarinet	at	home	,	while	her	mother	does	the	housework	.
The	idea	is	that	the	families	join	with	pride	and	joy	in	the	activities	of	the	orchestras	and	the	choirs
that	their	children	belong	to	.
The	huge	spiritual	world	that	music	produces	in	itself	,	which	also	lies	within	itself	,	ends	up	overcoming	material	poverty	.
From	the	minute	a	child	's	taught	how	to	play	an	instrument	,	he	's	no	longer	poor	.	He	becomes	a	child	in	progress	heading	for	a	professional	level	,	who	'll	later	become	a	full	citizen	.
Needless	to	say	that	music	is	the	number	one	prevention	against	prostitution	,	violence	,	bad	habits	,	and	everything	degrading	in	the	life	of	a	child	.
A	few	years	ago	,	historian	Arnold	Toynbee	said	that	the	world	was	suffering	a	huge	spiritual	crisis	.
Not	an	economic	or	social	crisis	,	but	a	spiritual	one	.
I	believe	that	to	confront	such	a	crisis	,	only	art	and	religion	can	give	proper	answers	to	humanity	,	to	mankind	's	deepest	aspirations	,	and	to	the	historic	demands	of	our	times	.
Education	--	the	synthesis	of	wisdom	and	knowledge	--	is	the	means	to	strive	for	a	more	perfect	,	more	aware	,	more	noble	and	more	just	society	.
With	passion	and	enthusiasm	we	pay	profound	respects	to	TED	for	its	outstanding	humanism	,	the	scope	of	its	principles	,	for	its	open	and	generous	promotion	of	young	values	.
We	hope	that	TED	can	contribute	in	a	full	and	fundamental	way	to	the	building	of	this	new	era	in	the	teaching	of	music	,	in	which	the	social	,	communal	,	spiritual	and	vindicatory	aims	of	the	child	and	the	adolescent	become	a	beacon	and	a	goal	for	a	vast	social	mission	.
No	longer	putting	society	at	the	service	of	art	,	and	much	less	at	the	services	of	monopolies	of	the	elite	,	but	instead	art	at	the	service	of	society	,	at	the	service	of	the	weakest	,	at	the	service	of	the	children	,	at	the	service	of	the	sick	,	at	the	service	of	the	vulnerable	,	and	at	the	service	of	all	those	who	cry	for	vindication	through	the	spirit	of	their	human	condition	and	the	raising	up	of	their	dignity	.
CA	:	We	are	going	live	now	to	Caracas	.	We	are	going	live	to	Caracas	to	hear	Maestro	Abreu	's	TED	Prize	wish	.
JA	:	Here	is	my	TED	Prize	wish	:	I	wish	that	you	'll	help	to	create	and	document	a	special	training	program	for	50	gifted	young	musicians	,	passionate	about	their	art	and	social	justice	,	and	dedicated	to	bringing	El	Sistema	to	the	United	States
and	other	countries	.
Thank	you	very	much	.
In	this	rather	long	sort	of	marathon	presentation	,	I	've	tried	to	break	it	up	into	three	parts	:	the	first	being	a	whole	lot	of	examples	on	how	it	can	be	a	little	bit	more	pleasurable	to	deal	with	a	computer	and	really	address	the	qualities	of	the	human	interface	.
And	these	will	be	some	simple	design	qualities	and	they	will	also	be	some	qualities	of	,	if	you	will	,	the	intelligence	of	interaction	.
Then	the	second	part	will	really	just	be	examples	of	new	technologies	--	new	media	falling	very	much	into	that	mold	.
Again	,	I	will	go	through	them	as	fast	as	possible	.
And	then	the	last	one	will	be	some	examples	I	've	been	able	to	collect	,	which	I	think	illustrate	this	at	least	as	best	I	can	,	in	the	world	of	entertainment	.
People	have	this	belief	--	and	I	share	most	of	it	--	that	we	will	be	using	the	TV	screens	or	their	equivalents	for	electronic	books	of	the	future	.	But	then	you	think	,	``	My	God	!	What	a	terrible	image	you	get	when	you	look	at	still	pictures	on	TV	.	''
Well	,	it	does	n't	have	to	be	terrible	.
And	that	is	a	slide	taken	from	a	TV	set	and	it	was	pre-processed	to	be	very	sympathetic	to	the	TV	medium	,	and	it	absolutely	looks	beautiful	.
Well	,	what	's	happened	?	How	did	people	get	into	this	mess	?
Where	you	are	now	,	all	of	a	sudden	,	sitting	in	front	of	personal	computers	and	video	text	--	teletext	systems	,	and	somewhat	horrified	by	what	you	see	on	the	screen	?
Well	,	you	have	to	remember	that	TV	was	designed	to	be	looked	at	eight	times	the	distance	of	the	diagonal	.
So	you	get	a	13-inch	,	19-inch	,	whatever	,	TV	,
and	then	you	should	multiply	that	by	eight	and	that	's	the	distance	you	should	sit	away	from	the	TV	set	.
Now	we	've	put	people	18	inches	in	front	of	a	TV	,	and	all	the	artifacts	that	none	of	the	original	designers	expected	to	be	seen	,	all	of	a	sudden	,	are	staring	you	in	the	face	:	the	shadow	mask	,	the	scan	lines	,	all	of	that	.
And	they	can	be	treated	very	easily	;
there	are	actually	ways	of	getting	rid	of	them	,
there	are	actually	ways	of	just	making	absolutely	beautiful	pictures	.
I	'm	talking	here	a	little	bit	about	display	technologies	.
Let	me	talk	about	how	you	might	input	information	.
And	my	favorite	example	is	always	fingers	.	I	'm	very	interested	in	touch-sensitive	displays	.	High-tech	,	high-touch	.	Is	n't	that	what	some	of	you	said	?
It	's	certainly	a	very	important	medium	for	input	,
and	a	lot	of	people	think	that	fingers	are	a	very	low-resolution	sort	of	stylus	for	inputting	to	a	display	.
In	fact	,	they	're	not	:	it	's	really	a	very	,	very	high-resolution	input	medium	--
you	have	to	just	do	it	twice	,	you	have	to	touch	the	screen	and	then	rotate	your	finger	slightly	--
and	you	can	move	a	cursor	with	great	accuracy	.
And	so	when	you	see	on	the	market	these	systems	that	have	just	a	few	light	emitting	diodes	on	the	side	and	are	very	low	resolution	,	it	's	nice	that	they	exist	because	it	still	is	better	than	nothing	.
But	it	,	in	some	sense	,	misses	the	point	:	namely	,	that	fingers	are	a	very	,	very	high-resolution	input	medium	.
Now	,	what	are	some	of	the	other	advantages	?
Well	,	the	one	advantage	is	that	you	do	n't	have	to	pick	them	up	,
and	people	do	n't	realize	how	important	that	is	--	not	having	to	pick	up	your	fingers	to	use	them	.
When	you	think	for	a	second	of	the	mouse	on	Macintosh	--	and	I	will	not	criticize	the	mouse	too	much	--	when	you	're	typing	--	what	you	have	--	you	want	to	now	put	something	--	first	of	all	,	you	've	got	to	find	the	mouse	.
You	have	to	probably	stop	.	Maybe	not	come	to	a	grinding	halt	,	but	you	've	got	to	sort	of	find	that	mouse	.	Then	you	find	the	mouse	,	and	you	're	going	to	have	to	wiggle	it	a	little	bit	to	see	where	the	cursor	is	on	the	screen	.
And	then	when	you	finally	see	where	it	is	,	then	you	've	got	to	move	it	to	get	the	cursor	over	there	,	and	then	--	``	Bang	''	--	you	've	got	to	hit	a	button	or	do	whatever	.
That	's	four	separate	steps	versus	typing	and	then	touching	and	typing	and	just	doing	it	all	in	one	motion	--	or	one-and-a-half	,	depending	on	how	you	want	to	count	.
Again	,	what	I	'm	trying	to	do	is	just	illustrate	the	kinds	of	problems	that	I	think	face	the	designers	of	new	computer	systems	and	entertainment	systems	and	educational	systems	from	the	perspective	of	the	quality	of	that	interface	.
And	another	advantage	,	of	course	,	of	using	fingers	is	you	have	10	of	them	.
And	we	have	never	known	how	to	do	this	technically	,
so	this	slide	is	a	fake	slide	.
We	never	succeeded	in	using	ten	fingers	,	but	there	are	certain	things	you	can	do	,	obviously	,	with	more	than	one-finger	input	,	which	is	rather	fascinating	.
What	we	did	stumble	across	was	something	...	Again	,	which	is	typical	of	the	computer	field	,	is	when	you	have	a	bug	that	you	ca	n't	get	rid	of	you	turn	it	into	a	feature	.
And	maybe	...	maybe	a	mouse	is	a	new	kind	of	bug	.
But	the	bug	in	our	case	was	in	touch-sensitive	displays	:
we	wanted	to	be	able	to	draw	--	you	know	,	rub	your	finger	across	the	screen	to	input	continuous	points	--
and	there	was	just	too	much	friction	created	between	your	finger	and	the	glass	--	if	glass	was	the	substrate	,	which	it	usually	is	.
So	we	found	that	that	actually	was	a	feature	in	the	sense	you	could	build	a	pressure-sensitive	display	.
And	when	you	touch	it	with	your	finger	,	you	can	actually	,	then	,	introduce	all	the	forces	on	the	face	of	that	screen	,	and	that	actually	has	a	certain	amount	of	value	.
Let	me	see	if	I	can	load	another	disc	and	show	you	,	quickly	,	an	example	.
Now	,	imagine	a	screen	,	which	is	not	only	touch-sensitive	now	,	it	's	pressure-sensitive	.
And	it	's	pressure-sensitive	to	the	forces	both	in	the	plane	of	the	screen	--	X	,	Y	,	and	Z	at	least	in	one	direction	;	we	could	n't	figure	out	how	to	come	in	the	other	direction	.
But	let	me	get	rid	of	the	slide	,
and	let	's	see	if	this	comes	on	.
OK	.	So	there	is	the	pressure-sensitive	display	in	operation	.
The	person	's	just	,	if	you	will	,	pushing	on	the	screen	to	make	a	curve	.
But	this	is	the	interesting	part	.
I	want	to	stop	it	for	a	second	because	the	movie	is	very	badly	made	.
And	the	particular	display	was	built	about	six	years	ago	,	and	when	we	moved	from	one	room	to	another	room	,	a	rather	large	person	sat	on	it	and	it	got	destroyed	.
So	all	we	have	is	this	record	.
But	imagine	that	screen	having	lots	of	objects	on	it
and	the	person	has	touched	an	object	--	one	of	N	--	like	he	did	there	,	and	then	pushed	on	it	.
Now	,	imagine	a	program	where	some	of	those	objects	are	physically	heavy	and	some	are	light	:
one	is	an	anvil	on	a	fuzzy	rug	and	the	other	one	is	a	ping-pong	ball	on	a	sheet	of	glass	.
And	when	you	touch	it	,	you	have	to	really	push	very	hard	to	move	that	anvil	across	the	screen	,
and	yet	you	touch	the	ping-pong	ball	very	lightly	and	it	just	scoots	across	the	screen	.
And	what	you	can	do	--	oops	,	I	did	n't	mean	to	do	that	--	what	you	can	do	is	actually	feed	back	to	the	user	the	feeling	of	the	physical	properties	.
So	again	,	they	do	n't	have	to	be	weight	;
they	could	be	a	general	trying	to	move	troops	,	and	he	's	got	to	move	an	aircraft	carrier	versus	a	little	boat	.
In	fact	,	they	funded	it	for	that	very	reason	.
The	whole	notion	,	then	,	is	one	that	at	the	interface	there	are	physical	properties	in	that	transducer	--	in	this	case	it	's	pressure	and	touches	--	that	allow	you	to	present	things	to	the	user	that	you	could	never	present	before	.
So	it	's	not	simply	looking	at	the	quality	or	,	if	you	will	,	the	luxury	of	that	interface	,	but	it	's	actually	looking	at	the	idea	of	presenting	things	that	previously	could	n't	be	presented	before	.
I	want	to	move	on	to	another	example	,	which	is	one	of	a	different	sort	,	where	we	're	trying	to	use	computer	and	video	disc	technology	now	to	come	up	with	a	new	kind	of	book	.
Here	,	the	idea	is	that	you	're	going	to	take	this	book	,	if	you	will	,	and	it	's	going	to	come	alive	.
You	're	going	to	sort	of	breathe	life	into	it	.
We	are	so	used	to	doing	monologues	.
Filmmakers	,	for	example	,	are	the	experts	in	monologue	making	:
you	make	a	film	and	it	has	a	well-formed	beginning	,	middle	and	end	,
and	in	some	sense	the	art	of	it	is	that	.
And	you	then	say	,	``	There	's	an	opportunity	for	making	conversational	movies	.	''	Well	,	what	does	that	mean	?
And	it	sort	of	nibbles	at	the	core	of	the	whole	profession	and	all	the	assumptions	of	that	medium	.
So	,	book	writing	is	the	same	thing	.
What	I	'll	show	you	very	quickly	is	a	new	kind	of	book	where	it	is	mixed	now	with	...	all	sorts	of	things	live	in	there	,	but	you	have	to	keep	a	few	things	in	mind	.
One	is	that	this	book	knows	about	itself	.
Each	frame	of	the	movie	has	information	about	itself	.
So	it	knows	,	or	at	least	there	is	computer-readable	information	in	the	medium	itself	.	It	's	just	not	a	static	movie	frame	.
That	's	one	thing	.	The	other	is	that	you	have	to	realize	that	it	is	a	random	access	medium	,	and	you	can	,	in	fact	,	branch	and	expand	and	elaborate	and	shrink	.
And	here	--	again	,	my	favorite	example	--	is	the	cookbook	,	the	``	Larousse	Gastronomique	.	''
And	I	think	I	use	the	example	all	too	often	,	but	it	's	a	great	one	because	there	is	a	classic	ending	in	that	little	encyclopedia-style	cookbook	that	tells	you	how	to	do	something	like	penguin	,	and	you	get	to	the	end	of	the	recipe	and	it	says	,	``	Cook	until	done	.	''
Now	,	that	would	be	,	if	you	will	,	the	top	green	track	,	which	does	n't	mean	too	much	.	But	you	might	have	to	elaborate	for	me	or	for	somebody	who	is	n't	an	expert	,	and	say	,	``	Cook	at	380	degrees	for	45	minutes	.	''
And	then	for	a	real	beginner	,	you	would	go	down	even	further	and	elaborate	more	--	say	,	``	Open	the	oven	,	preheat	,	wait	for	the	light	to	go	out	,	open	the	door	,	do	n't	leave	it	open	too	long	,	put	the	penguin	in	and	shut	the	door	...	''	whatever	.
And	that	's	a	much	more	elaborate	one	than	you	dribble	back	.
That	's	one	kind	of	use	of	random	access	.	And	the	other	is	where	you	want	to	explain	the	same	thing	in	different	ways	.
If	you	're	in	a	classroom	situation	and	somebody	asks	a	question	,	the	last	thing	you	do	is	repeat	what	you	just	said	.
You	try	and	think	of	a	different	way	of	saying	the	same	thing	,	or	if	you	know	the	particular	student	and	that	student	's	cognitive	style	,	then	you	might	say	it	in	a	way	that	you	think	would	have	a	good	impedance	match	with	that	student	.
There	are	all	sorts	of	techniques	you	will	use	--	and	again	,	this	is	a	different	kind	of	branching	.
So	,	what	I	will	show	you	is	...	it	's	a	rather	boring	book	,	but	I	'm	afraid	sometimes	you	have	to	do	boring	books	because	your	sponsors	are	n't	necessarily	interested	in	fiction	and	entertainment	.	And	this	is	a	book	on	how	to	repair	a	transmission	.
Now	,	I	do	n't	even	know	what	vintage	the	transmission	is	,	but	let	me	just	show	you	very	quickly	some	of	it	,	and	we	'll	move	on	.
Nicholas	Negroponte	:	Now	,	this	is	his	table	of	contents	.
Just	a	picture	of	the	transmission	,	and	as	you	rub	your	finger	across	the	transmission
it	highlights	the	various	parts	.
Narrator	:	When	I	find	a	chapter	that	I	want	to	see	,	I	just	touch	the	text	and	the	system	will	format	pages	for	me	to	read	.
The	words	or	phrases	that	are	lit	up	in	red	are	glossary	words	,	so	I	can	get	a	different	definition	by	just	touching	the	word	,	and	the	definition	appears	,	superimposed	over	the	illustration	.
NN	:	This	is	about	the	oil	pan	,	or	the	oil	filter	and	all	that	.
This	is	relatively	important	because	it	sets	the	page	...	Narrator	:	This	is	another	example	of	a	page	with	glossary	words	highlighted	in	red	.
I	can	get	a	definition	of	these	words	just	by	touching	them	,	and	the	definition	will	appear	in	the	illustration	corner	.
I	can	get	back	to	the	illustration	,	but	in	this	case	it	's	not	a	single	frame	,
but	it	's	actually	a	movie	of	someone	coming	into	the	frame	and	doing	the	repair	that	's	described	in	the	text	.
The	two-headed	slider	is	a	speed	control	that	allows	me	to	watch	the	movie	at	various	speeds	,	in	forward	or	reverse	.
And	the	movie	is	displayed	as	a	full	frame	movie	.
I	can	go	back	to	the	beginning	...	and	play	the	movie	at	full	speed	.
Here	's	another	step-by-step	procedure	,	only	in	this	case	--	NN	:	Okay	,	this	movie	is	...	Everybody	's	heard	of	sound-sync	movies	--
this	is	text-sync	movies	,	so	as	the	movie	plays	,	the	text	gets	highlighted	.	We	highlight	the	text	as	we	go	through	the	movie	.
Repairman	:	...	Not	too	far	out	.	Front	poles	,	preferably	.
Do	n't	loosen	them	too	far	.	If	you	loosen	them	too	far	,	you	'll	have	a	big	mess	.
NN	:	I	suspect	that	some	of	you	might	not	even	understand	that	language	.
OK	.	I	'm	at	the	third	and	last	part	of	this	,	which	I	said	I	would	make	an	attempt	to	at	least	give	you	some	examples	that	may	be	more	directly	related	to	the	world	of	entertainment	.
And	of	course	,	good	education	has	got	to	be	good	entertainment	,
so	my	first	example	will	be	drawn	from	a	very	recent	experiment	that	we	've	been	doing	--	in	this	case	,	in	Senegal	--	where	we	have	tried	to	use	personal	computers	as	a	pedagogical	medium	.	But	not	as	teaching	machines	at	all	;
the	whole	notion	is	to	use	this	as	an	instrument	where	there	is	a	complete	reversal	of	roles	--
the	child	is	,	if	you	will	,	the	teacher	and	the	machine	is	the	student	--
and	the	art	of	computer	programming	is	a	vehicle	that	sort	of	approximates	thinking	about	thinking	.
But	teaching	kids	programming	per	se	is	utterly	irrelevant	.
And	there	are	just	a	few	slides	I	want	to	go	through	,	but	there	's	a	story	I	'd	like	to	tell	.	And	that	was	when	,	before	we	did	this	in	any	developing	countries	--	we	're	doing	it	,	in	fact	,	in	three	developing	countries	right	now	:	Pakistan	,	Colombia	and	Senegal	--
we	did	it	in	some	pretty	rough	areas	of	New	York	City	.
And	one	child	,	whose	name	I	've	forgotten	,	was	about	seven	or	eight	years	old	,	absolutely	considered	mentally	handicapped	--	could	n't	read	,	did	n't	even	make	it	in	the	lowest	section	of	the	school	's	classes	--
and	was	pretty	much	not	in	school	,	though	physically	there	.
But	did	hang	around	the	,	quote	,	``	computer	room	,	''	where	there	were	quite	a	few	computers	,	and	learned	this	particular	language	called	Logo	--
and	learned	it	with	great	ease	and	found	it	a	lot	of	fun	,
it	was	very	interesting	.	And	one	day	,	by	chance	,	some	visitors	from	the	NIE	came	by	in	their	double-breasted	suits	looking	at	this	setup	,	and	none	of	the	children	who	were	normally	there	,	except	for	this	one	child	,	were	there	.
He	was	,	and	he	said	,	``	Let	me	show	you	how	this	works	,	''
and	they	got	an	absolutely	ingenuous	,	wonderful	description	of	Logo	.
And	the	child	was	just	zipping	right	through	it	,	showing	them	all	sorts	of	things	until	they	asked	him	how	to	do	something	which	he	could	n't	explain
and	so	he	flipped	through	the	manual	,	found	the	explanation	and	typed	the	command	and	got	it	to	do	what	they	asked	.
They	were	delighted	,	and	by	the	time	it	was	time	to	go	see	the	principal	,	whom	they	'd	actually	come	to	see	--	not	the	computer	room	--	they	went	upstairs	and	they	said	,	``	This	is	absolutely	remarkable	!
That	child	was	very	articulate	and	showed	us	and	even	dealt	with	the	things	he	could	n't	do	automatically	with	that	manual	.	It	was	just	absolutely	fantastic	.	''
The	principal	said	,	``	There	's	a	dreadful	mistake	,	because	that	child	ca	n't	read	.
And	you	obviously	have	been	hoodwinked	or	you	've	talked	about	somebody	else	.	''
And	they	all	got	up	and	they	all	went	downstairs
and	the	child	was	still	there	.	And	they	did	something	very	intelligent	:	they	asked	the	child	,	``	Can	you	read	?	''
And	the	child	said	,	``	No	,	I	ca	n't	.	''
And	then	they	said	,	``	But	wait	a	minute	.	You	just	looked	through	that	manual	and	you	found	...	``	and	he	said	,	``	Oh	,	but	that	's	not	reading	.	''
And	so	they	said	,	``	Well	,	what	's	reading	then	?	''
He	says	,	``	Well	,	reading	is	this	junk	they	give	me	in	little	books	to	read	.
It	's	absolutely	irrelevant	,	and	I	get	nothing	for	it	.
But	here	,	with	a	little	bit	of	effort	I	get	a	lot	of	return	.	''
And	it	really	meant	something	to	the	child	.
The	child	read	beautifully	,	it	turned	out	,	and	was	really	very	competent	.	So	it	actually	meant	something	.
And	that	story	has	many	other	anecdotes	that	are	similar	,	but	wow	.	The	key	to	the	future	of	computers	in	education	is	right	there	,
and	it	is	:	when	does	it	mean	something	to	a	child	?
There	is	a	myth	,	and	it	truly	is	a	myth	:	we	believe	--	and	I	'm	sure	a	lot	of	you	believe	in	this	room	--	that	it	is	harder	to	read	and	write	than	it	is	to	learn	how	to	speak	.
And	it	's	not	,	but	we	think	speech	--	``	My	God	,	little	children	pick	it	up	somehow	,
and	by	the	age	of	two	they	're	doing	a	mediocre	job	,
and	by	three	and	four	they	're	speaking	reasonably	well	.
And	yet	you	've	got	to	go	to	school	to	learn	how	to	read	,
and	you	have	to	sit	in	a	classroom	and	somebody	has	to	teach	you	.	Hence	,	it	must	be	harder	.	''	Well	,	it	's	not	harder	.
What	the	truth	is	is	that	speaking	has	great	value	to	a	child	;
the	child	can	get	a	great	deal	by	talking	to	you	.
Reading	and	writing	is	utterly	useless	.
There	is	no	reason	for	a	child	to	read	and	write	except	blind	faith	,	and	that	it	's	going	to	help	you	.
So	what	happens	is	you	go	to	school	and	people	say	,	``	Just	believe	me	,	you	're	going	to	like	it	.
You	're	going	to	like	reading	,	''	and	just	read	and	read	.
On	the	other	hand	,	you	give	a	kid	--	a	three-year-old	kid	--	a	computer
and	they	type	a	little	command	and	--	Poof	!	--	something	happens	.
And	all	of	a	sudden	...	You	may	not	call	that	reading	and	writing	,	but	a	certain	bit	of	typing	and	reading	stuff	on	the	screen	has	a	huge	payoff	,	and	it	's	a	lot	of	fun	.
And	in	fact	,	it	's	a	powerful	educational	instrument	.
Well	,	in	Senegal	we	found	that	this	was	the	traditional	classroom	:	120	kids	--	three	per	desk	--	one	teacher	,	a	little	bit	of	chalk	.
This	student	was	one	of	our	first	students	,	and	it	's	the	girl	on	the	left	leaning	with	her	chalkboard	,
and	she	came	...	within	two	days	--	I	want	to	show	you	the	program	she	wrote	,	and	remember	her	hairstyle	.	And	that	is	the	program	she	made	.
That	's	what	meant	something	to	her	,	is	doing	the	hair	pattern	,	and	actually	did	it	within	two	days	--	an	hour	each	day	--	and	found	it	was	,	to	her	,	absolutely	the	most	meaningful	piece	...
But	rooted	in	that	,	little	did	she	know	how	much	knowledge	she	was	acquiring	about	geometry	and	just	math	and	logic	and	all	the	rest	.
And	again	,	I	could	talk	for	three	hours	about	this	subject	.
I	will	come	to	my	last	example	and	then	quit	.
And	my	last	example	--	as	some	of	my	former	colleagues	,	whom	I	see	in	the	room	,	can	imagine	what	it	will	be	.
Yes	,	it	is	.	It	's	our	work	--	that	was	a	while	ago	,	and	it	still	is	my	favorite	project	--	of	teleconferencing	.
And	the	reason	it	remains	a	favorite	project	is	that	we	were	asked	to	do	a	teleconferencing	system	where	you	had	the	following	situation	:	you	had	five	people	at	five	different	sites	--	they	were	known	people	--
and	you	had	to	have	these	people	in	teleconference	,	such	that	each	one	was	utterly	convinced	that	the	other	four	were	physically	present	.
Now	,	that	is	sufficiently	zany	that	we	would	,	obviously	,	jump	to	the	bait	,	and	we	did	.
And	the	fact	that	we	knew	the	people	--	we	had	to	take	a	page	out	of	the	history	of	Walt	Disney	--
we	actually	went	so	far	as	to	build	CRTs	in	the	shapes	of	the	people	's	faces	.
So	if	I	wanted	to	call	my	friend	Peter	Sprague	on	the	phone	,	my	secretary	would	get	his	head	out	and	bring	it	and	set	it	on	the	desk	,
and	that	would	be	the	TV	used	for	the	occasion	.
And	it	's	uncanny	:	there	's	no	way	I	can	explain	to	you	the	amount	of	eye	contact	you	get	with	that	physical	face	projected	on	a	3D	CRT	of	that	sort	.
The	next	thing	that	we	had	to	do	is	to	persuade	them	that	there	needed	to	be	spatial	correspondence	,	which	is	straightforward	,	but	again	,	it	's	something	that	did	n't	fall	naturally	out	of	a	telecommunications	or	computing	style	of	thinking	;
it	was	a	very	,	if	you	will	,	architectural	or	spatial	concept	.	And	that	was	to	recognize	that	when	you	sit	around	the	table	,	the	actual	location	of	the	people	becomes	rather	important	.
And	when	somebody	gets	up	,	in	fact	,	to	go	answer	a	phone	or	use	a	bathroom	or	something	,	the	empty	seat	becomes	,	if	you	will	,	that	person	.	And	you	point	frequently	to	the	empty	seat	and	you	say	,	``	He	or	she	would	n't	agree	,	''
and	the	empty	chair	is	that	person	and	the	spatiality	is	crucial	.
So	we	said	,	``	Well	,	these	will	be	on	round	tables	and	the	order	around	the	table	had	to	be	the	same	,
so	that	at	my	site	,	I	would	be	,	if	you	will	,	real
and	then	at	each	other	's	site	you	'd	have	these	plastic	heads	.
And	the	plastic	heads	,	sometimes	you	want	to	project	them	.	And	there	are	a	number	of	schemes	,	which	I	do	n't	want	to	dwell	on	,
but	this	is	the	one	that	we	finally	used	where	we	projected	onto	rear	screen	material	that	was	molded	in	the	face	--	literally	in	the	face	of	the	person	.
And	I	'll	show	you	one	more	slide	,	where	this	is	actually	made	from	something	called	a	solid	photograph	and	is	the	screen	.
Now	,	we	track	,	on	the	person	's	head	,	the	head	motions	--
so	we	transmit	with	a	video	the	head	positions	--
and	so	this	head	moves	in	about	two	axes	.
So	if	I	,	all	of	a	sudden	,	turn	to	the	person	to	my	left	and	start	talking	to	that	person	,	then	at	the	person	to	my	right	's	site	,	he	'll	see	these	two	plastic	heads	talking	to	each	other	.
And	then	if	that	person	interrupts	,	then	those	two	heads	may	turn	.
And	it	really	is	reconstructing	,	quite	accurately	,	teleconferencing	.
If	you	think	about	the	phone	--	and	Intel	has	tested	a	lot	of	the	things	I	'm	going	to	show	you	,	over	the	last	10	years	,	in	about	600	elderly	households	--	300	in	Ireland	,	and	300	in	Portland	--	trying	to	understand	:	How	do	we	measure	and	monitor	behavior	in	a	medically	meaningful	way	?
And	if	you	think	about	the	phone	,	right	,	it	's	something	that	we	can	use	for	some	incredible	ways	to	help	people	actually	take	the	right	medication	at	the	right	time	.
We	're	testing	these	kinds	of	simple	sensor-network	technologies	in	the	home	so	that	any	phone	that	a	senior	is	already	comfortable	with	can	help	them	deal	with	their	medications	.
And	a	lot	of	what	they	do	is	they	pick	up	the	phone	,	and	it	's	our	system	whispering	to	them	which	pill	they	need	to	take	,	and	they	fake	like	they	're	having	a	conversation	with	a	friend	.
And	they	're	not	embarrassed	by	a	meds	caddy	that	's	ugly	,	that	sits	on	their	kitchen	table	and	says	,	``	I	'm	old	.	I	'm	frail	.	''
It	's	surreptitious	technology	that	's	helping	them	do	a	simple	task	of	taking	the	right	pill	at	the	right	time	.
Now	,	we	also	do	some	pretty	amazing	things	with	these	phones	.
Because	that	moment	when	you	answer	the	phone	is	a	cognitive	test	every	time	that	you	do	it	.
Think	about	it	,	all	right	?	I	'm	going	to	answer	the	phone	three	different	times	.
``	Hello	?	Hey	.	''
All	right	?	That	's	the	first	time	.
``	Hello	?	Uh	,	hey	.	''
``	Hello	?	Uh	,	who	?
Oh	,	hey	.	''
All	right	?	Very	big	differences	between	the	way	I	answered	the	phone	the	three	times	.
And	as	we	monitor	phone	usage	by	seniors	over	a	long	period	of	time	,	down	to	the	tenths	of	a	microsecond	,	that	recognition	moment	of	whether	they	can	figure	out	that	person	on	the	other	end	is	a	friend	and	we	start	talking	to	them	immediately	,	or	they	do	a	lot	of	what	's	called	trouble	talk	,	where	they	're	like	,	``	Wait	,	who	is	this	?	Oh	.	''	Right	?
Waiting	for	that	recognition	moment	may	be	the	best	early	indicator	of	the	onset	of	dementia	than	anything	that	shows	up	clinically	today	.
We	call	these	behavioral	markers	.
There	's	lots	of	others	.	Is	the	person	going	to	the	phone	as	quickly	,	when	it	rings	,	as	they	used	to	?
Is	it	a	hearing	problem	or	is	it	a	physicality	problem	?
Has	their	voice	gotten	more	quiet	?	We	're	doing	a	lot	of	work	with	people	with	Alzheimer	's	and	particularly	with	Parkinson	's	,
where	that	quiet	voice	that	sometimes	shows	up	with	Parkinson	's	patients	may	be	the	best	early	indicator	of	Parkinson	's	five	to	10	years	before	it	shows	up	clinically	.
But	those	subtle	changes	in	your	voice	over	a	long	period	of	time	are	hard	for	you	or	your	spouse	to	notice	until	it	becomes	so	extreme	and	your	voice	has	become	so	quiet	.
So	,	sensors	are	looking	at	that	kind	of	voice	.
When	you	pick	up	the	phone	,	how	much	tremor	are	you	having	,	and	what	is	that	like	,	and	what	is	that	trend	like	over	a	period	of	time	?
Are	you	having	more	trouble	dialing	the	phone	than	you	used	to	?
Is	it	a	dexterity	problem	?	Is	it	the	onset	of	arthritis	?
Are	you	using	the	phone	?	Are	you	socializing	less	than	you	used	to	?
And	looking	at	that	pattern	.	And	what	does	that	decline	in	social	health	mean	,	as	a	kind	of	a	vital	sign	of	the	future	?
And	then	wow	,	what	a	radical	idea	,	we	--	except	in	the	United	States	--	might	be	able	to	use	this	newfangled	technology	to	actually	interact	with	a	nurse	or	a	doctor	on	the	other	end	of	the	line	.
Wow	,	what	a	great	day	that	will	be	once	we	're	allowed	to	actually	do	those	kinds	of	things	.
So	,	these	are	what	I	would	call	behavioral	markers	.
And	it	's	the	whole	field	that	we	've	been	trying	to	work	on	for	the	last	10	years	at	Intel	.
How	do	you	put	simple	disruptive	technologies	,	and	the	first	of	five	phrases	that	I	'm	going	to	talk	about	in	this	talk	?
Behavioral	markers	matter	.
How	do	we	change	behavior	?
How	do	we	measure	changes	in	behavior	in	a	meaningful	way	that	's	going	to	help	us	with	prevention	of	disease	,	early	onset	of	disease	,	and	tracking	the	progression	of	disease	over	a	long	period	of	time	?
Now	,	why	would	Intel	let	me	spend	a	lot	of	time	and	money	,	over	the	last	10	years	,	trying	to	understand	the	needs	of	seniors	and	start	thinking	about	these	kinds	of	behavioral	markers	?
This	is	some	of	the	field	work	that	we	've	done	.
We	have	now	lived	with	1,000	elderly	households	in	20	countries	over	the	last	10	years	.
We	study	people	in	Rochester	,	New	York	.
We	go	live	with	them	in	the	winter	because	what	they	do	in	the	winter	,	and	their	access	to	healthcare	,	and	how	much	they	socialize	,	is	very	different	than	in	the	summer	.
If	they	have	a	hip	fracture	we	go	with	them	and	we	study	their	entire	discharge	experience	.
If	they	have	a	family	member	who	is	a	key	part	of	their	care	network	,	we	fly	and	study	them	as	well	.
So	,	we	study	the	holistic	health	experience	of	1,000	seniors	over	the	last	10	years	in	20	different	countries	.
Why	is	Intel	willing	to	fund	that	?
It	's	because	of	the	second	slogan	that	I	want	to	talk	about	.	Ten	years	ago	,	when	I	started	trying	to	convince	Intel	to	let	me	go	start	looking	at	disruptive	technologies	that	could	help	with	independent	living	,	this	is	what	I	called	it	:	``	Y2K	+	10	.	''	You	know	,	back	in	2000	,	we	were	all	so	obsessed	with	paying	attention	to	the	aging	of	our	computers	,	and	whether	or	not	they	were	going	to	survive	the	tick	of	the	clock	from	1999	to	2000	,	that	we	missed	a	moment	that	only	demographers	were	paying	attention	to	.
It	was	right	around	New	Years	.
And	that	switchover	,	when	we	had	the	larger	number	of	older	people	on	the	planet	,	for	the	first	time	than	younger	people	.
For	the	first	time	in	human	history	--	and	barring	aliens	landing	or	some	major	other	pandemic	,	that	's	the	expectation	from	demographers	,	going	forward	.
And	10	years	ago	it	seemed	like	I	had	a	lot	of	time	to	convince	Intel	to	work	on	this	.	Right	?
Y2K	+	10	was	coming	,	the	baby	boomers	starting	to	retire	.
Well	folks	,	it	's	like	we	know	these	demographics	here	.
This	is	a	map	of	the	entire	world	.	It	's	like	the	lights	are	on	,	but	nobody	's	home	on	this	demographic	Y2K	+	10	problem	.	Right	?
I	mean	we	sort	of	get	it	here	,	but	we	do	n't	get	it	here	,
and	we	're	not	doing	anything	about	it	.
The	health	reform	bill	is	largely	ignoring	the	realities	of	the	age	wave	that	's	coming	,	and	the	implications	for	what	we	need	to	do	to	change	not	only	how	we	pay	for	care	,	but	deliver	care	in	some	radically	different	ways	.
And	in	fact	,	it	's	upon	us	.
I	mean	you	probably	saw	these	headlines	.	This	is	Catherine	Casey	who	is	the	first	boomer	to	actually	get	Social	Security	.
That	actually	occurred	this	year	.	She	took	early	retirement	.
She	was	born	one	second	after	midnight	in	1946	.
A	retired	school	teacher	,
there	she	is	with	a	Social	Security	administrator	.
The	first	boomer	actually	,	we	did	n't	even	wait	till	2011	,	next	year	.
We	're	already	starting	to	see	early	retirement	occur	this	year	.
All	right	,	so	it	's	here	.	This	Y2K	+	10	problem	is	at	our	door	.
This	is	50	tsunamis	scheduled	on	the	calendar	,
but	somehow	we	ca	n't	sort	of	marshal	our	government	and	innovative	forces	to	sort	of	get	out	in	front	of	it	and	do	something	about	it	.	We	'll	wait	until	it	's	more	of	a	catastrophe	,	and	react	,	as	opposed	to	prepare	for	it	.
So	,	one	of	the	reasons	it	's	so	challenging	to	prepare	for	this	Y2K	problem	is	,	I	want	to	argue	,	we	have	what	I	would	call	mainframe	poisoning	.
Andy	Grove	,	about	six	or	seven	years	ago	,	he	does	n't	even	know	or	remember	this	,	in	a	Fortune	Magazine	article	he	used	the	phrase	``	mainframe	healthcare	,	''	and	I	've	been	extending	and	expanding	this	.
He	saw	it	written	down	somewhere	.	He	's	like	,	``	Eric	that	's	a	really	cool	concept	.	''
I	was	like	,	``	Actually	it	was	your	idea	.	You	said	it	in	a	Fortune	Magazine	article	.
I	just	extended	it	.	''
You	know	,	this	is	the	mainframe	.
This	mentality	of	traveling	to	and	timesharing	large	,	expensive	healthcare	systems	actually	began	in	1787	.
This	is	the	first	general	hospital	in	Vienna	.
And	actually	the	second	general	hospital	in	Vienna	,	in	about	1850	,	was	where	we	started	to	build	out	an	entire	curriculum	for	teaching	med	students	specialties	.
And	it	's	a	place	in	which	we	started	developing	architecture	that	literally	divided	the	body	,	and	divided	care	into	departments	and	compartments	.
And	it	was	reflected	in	our	architecture	,
it	was	reflected	in	the	way	that	we	taught	students	,
and	this	mainframe	mentality	persists	today	.
Now	,	I	'm	not	anti-hospital	.
With	my	own	healthcare	problems	,	I	've	taken	drug	therapies	,	I	've	traveled	to	this	hospital	and	others	,	many	,	many	times	.
But	we	worship	the	high	hospital	on	a	hill	.	Right	?
And	this	is	mainframe	healthcare	.
And	just	as	30	years	ago	we	could	n't	conceive	that	we	would	have	the	power	of	a	mainframe	computer	that	took	up	a	room	this	size	in	our	purses	and	on	our	belts	,	that	we	're	carrying	around	in	our	cell	phone	today	,
and	suddenly	,	computing	,	that	used	to	be	an	expert	driven	system	,	it	was	a	personal	system	that	we	all	owned	as	part	of	our	daily	lives	--
that	shift	from	mainframe	to	personal	computing	is	what	we	have	to	do	for	healthcare	.
We	have	to	shift	from	this	mainframe	mentality	of	healthcare	to	a	personal	model	of	healthcare	.
We	are	obsessed	with	this	way	of	thinking	.
When	Intel	does	surveys	all	around	the	world	and	we	say	,	``	Quick	response	:	healthcare	.	''	The	first	word	that	comes	up	is	``	doctor	.	''
The	second	that	comes	up	is	``	hospital	.	''	And	the	third	is	``	illness	''	or	``	sickness	.	''	Right	?
We	are	wired	,	in	our	imagination	,	to	think	about	healthcare	and	healthcare	innovation	as	something	that	goes	into	that	place	.
Our	entire	health	reform	discussion	right	now	,	health	I.T.	,	when	we	talk	with	policy	makers	,	equals	``	How	are	we	going	to	get	doctors	using	electronic	medical	records	in	the	mainframe	?	''
We	're	not	thinking	about	how	do	we	shift	from	the	mainframe	to	the	home	.
And	the	problem	with	this	is	the	way	we	conceive	healthcare	.	Right	?
This	is	a	very	reactive	,	crisis-driven	system	.
We	're	doing	15-minute	exams	with	patients	.
It	's	population-based	.
We	collect	a	bunch	of	biological	information	in	this	artificial	setting	,
and	we	fix	them	up	,	like	Humpty-Dumpty	all	over	again	,	and	send	them	home	,	and	hope	--	we	might	hand	them	a	brochure	,	maybe	an	interactive	website	--	that	they	do	as	asked	and	do	n't	come	back	into	the	mainframe	.
And	the	problem	is	we	ca	n't	afford	it	today	,	folks	.
We	ca	n't	afford	mainframe	healthcare	today	to	include	the	uninsured	.
And	now	we	want	to	do	a	double-double	of	the	age	wave	coming	through	?
Business	as	usual	in	healthcare	is	broken	and	we	've	got	to	do	something	different	.
We	've	got	to	focus	on	the	home	.
We	've	got	to	focus	on	a	personal	healthcare	paradigm	that	moves	care	to	the	home	.	How	do	we	be	more	proactive	,	prevention-driven	?
How	do	we	collect	vital	signs	and	other	kinds	of	information	24	by	7	?
How	do	we	get	a	personal	baseline	about	what	's	going	to	work	for	you	?
How	do	we	collect	not	just	biological	data	but	behavioral	data	,	psychological	data	,	relational	data	,	in	and	on	and	around	the	home	?
And	how	do	we	drive	compliance	to	be	a	customized	care	plan	that	uses	all	this	great	technology	that	's	around	us	to	change	our	behavior	?
That	's	what	we	need	to	do	for	our	personal	health	model	.
I	want	to	give	you	a	couple	of	examples	.	This	is	Mimi	from	one	of	our	studies	--	in	her	90s	,	had	to	move	out	of	her	home	because	her	family	was	worried	about	falls	.
Raise	your	hand	if	you	had	a	serious	fall	in	your	household	,	or	any	of	your	loved	ones	,	your	parents	or	so	forth	.	Right	?
Classic	.	Hip	fracture	often	leads	to	institutionalization	of	a	senior	.
This	is	what	was	happening	to	Mimi	;	the	family	was	worried	about	it	,	moved	her	out	of	her	own	home	into	an	assisted	living	facility	.
She	tripped	over	her	oxygen	tank	.
Many	people	in	this	generation	wo	n't	press	the	button	,	even	if	they	have	an	alert	call	system	,	because	they	do	n't	want	to	bother	anybody	,	even	though	they	've	been	paying	30	dollars	a	month	.
Boomers	will	press	the	button	.	Trust	me	.
They	're	going	to	be	pressing	that	button	non-stop	.	Right	?
Mimi	broke	her	pelvis	,	lay	all	night	,	all	morning	,	finally	somebody	came	in	and	found	her	,	sent	her	to	the	hospital	.
They	fixed	her	back	up	.	She	was	never	going	to	be	able	to	move	back	into	the	assisted	living	.	They	put	her	into	the	nursing	home	unit	.
First	night	in	the	nursing	home	unit	where	she	had	been	in	the	same	assisted	living	facility	,	moved	her	from	one	bed	to	another	,	kind	of	threw	her	,	rebroke	her	pelvis	,
sent	her	back	to	the	hospital	that	she	had	just	come	from	,	no	one	read	the	chart	,	put	her	on	Tylenol	,	which	she	is	allergic	to	,	broke	out	,	got	bedsores	,	basically	,	had	heart	problems	,	and	died	from	the	fall	and	the	complications	and	the	errors	that	were	there	.
Now	,	the	most	frightening	thing	about	this	is	this	is	my	wife	's	grandmother	.
Now	,	I	'm	Eric	Dishman	.	I	speak	English	,
I	work	for	Intel	,	I	make	a	good	salary	,
I	'm	smart	about	falls	and	fall-related	injuries	--
it	's	an	area	of	research	that	I	work	on	.
I	have	access	to	senators	and	CEOs	.
I	ca	n't	stop	this	from	happening	.
What	happens	if	you	do	n't	have	money	,	you	do	n't	speak	English	or	do	n't	have	the	kind	of	access	to	deal	with	these	kinds	of	problems	that	inevitably	occur	?
How	do	we	actually	prevent	the	vast	majority	of	falls	from	ever	occurring	in	the	first	place	?
Let	me	give	you	a	quick	example	of	work	that	we	're	doing	to	try	to	do	exactly	that	.
I	've	been	wearing	a	little	technology	that	we	call	Shimmer	.
It	's	a	research	platform	.
It	has	accelerometry	.	You	can	plug	in	a	three-lead	ECG	.
There	is	all	kinds	of	sort	of	plug-and-play	kind	of	Legos	that	you	can	do	to	capture	,	in	the	wild	,	in	the	real	world	,	things	like	tremor	,	gait	,	stride	length	and	those	kinds	of	things	.
The	problem	is	,	our	understanding	of	falls	today	,	like	Mimi	,	is	get	a	survey	in	the	mail	three	months	after	you	fell	,
from	the	State	,	saying	,	``	What	were	you	doing	when	you	fell	?	''
That	's	sort	of	the	state	of	the	art	.
But	with	something	like	Shimmer	,	or	we	have	something	called	the	Magic	Carpet	,	embedded	sensors	in	carpet	,	or	camera-based	systems	that	we	borrowed	from	sports	medicine	,	we	're	starting	for	the	first	time	in	those	600	elderly	households	to	collect	actual	kinematic	motion	data	to	understand	:	What	are	the	subtle	changes	that	are	occurring	that	can	show	us	that	mom	has	become	risk	at	falls	?
And	most	often	we	can	do	two	interventions	,	fix	the	meds	mix	.
I	'm	a	qualitative	researcher	,	but	when	I	look	at	these	data	streams	coming	in	from	these	homes	,	I	can	look	at	the	data	and	tell	you	the	day	that	some	doctor	prescribed	them	something	that	nobody	else	knew	that	they	were	on	,	because	we	see	the	changes	in	their	patterns	in	the	household	.	Right	?
These	discoveries	of	behavioral	markers	,	and	behavioral	changes	are	game	changing	,	and	like	the	discovery	of	the	microscope	because	of	our	collecting	data	streams	that	we	've	actually	never	done	before	.
This	is	an	example	in	our	TRIL	Clinic	in	Ireland	of	--	actually	what	you	're	seeing	is	she	's	looking	at	data	,	in	this	picture	,	from	the	Magic	Carpet	.
So	,	we	have	a	little	carpet	that	you	can	look	at	your	amount	of	postural	sway	,	and	look	at	the	changes	in	your	postural	sway	over	many	months	.
Here	's	what	some	of	this	data	might	look	like	.
This	is	actually	sensor	firings	.
These	are	two	different	subjects	in	our	study	.
It	's	about	a	year	's	worth	of	data	.
The	color	represents	different	rooms	they	are	in	the	house	.
This	person	on	the	left	is	living	in	their	own	home	.
This	person	on	the	right	is	actually	living	in	an	assisted	living	facility	.
I	know	this	because	look	at	how	punctuated	meal	time	is	when	they	are	no	longer	in	their	particular	rooms	here	.	Right	?
Now	,	this	does	n't	mean	that	much	to	you	.
But	when	we	look	at	these	cycles	of	data	over	a	longer	period	of	time	--	and	we	're	looking	at	everything	from	motion	around	different	rooms	in	the	house	,	to	sort	of	micro-motions	that	Shimmer	picks	up	,	about	gait	and	stride	length	--	these	streams	of	data	are	starting	to	tell	us	things	about	behavioral	patterns	that	we	've	never	understood	before	.
You	can	go	to	ORCATech.org	--	it	has	nothing	to	do	with	whales	,	it	's	the	Oregon	Center	for	Aging	and	Technology	--
to	see	more	about	that	.
The	problem	is	,	Intel	is	still	one	of	the	largest	funders	in	the	world	of	independent	living	technology	research	.
I	'm	not	bragging	about	how	much	we	fund	;	it	's	how	little	anyone	else	actually	pays	attention	to	aging	and	funds	innovation	on	aging	,	chronic	disease	management	and	independent	living	in	the	home	.
So	,	my	mantra	here	,	my	fourth	slogan	is	:	10,000	households	or	bust	.
We	need	to	drive	a	national	,	if	not	international	,	Framingham-type	heart	study	of	independent	living	technologies	,	where	we	have	10,000	elderly	connected	households	with	broadband	,	full	medical	characterization	,	and	a	platform	by	which	we	can	start	to	experiment	and	turn	these	from	20-household	anecdotal	studies	that	the	universities	fund	,	to	large	clinical	trials	that	prove	out	the	value	of	these	technologies	.
So	,	10,000	households	or	bust	.
These	are	just	some	of	the	households	that	we	've	done	in	the	Intel	studies	.
My	fifth	and	final	phrase	:	I	have	tried	for	two	years	,	and	there	were	moments	when	we	were	quite	close	,	to	make	this	healthcare	reform	bill	be	about	reform	from	something	and	to	something	,
from	a	mainframe	model	to	a	personal	health	model	,	or	to	mean	something	more	than	just	a	debate	about	the	public	option	and	how	we	're	going	to	finance	.
It	does	n't	matter	how	we	finance	healthcare	.
We	're	going	to	figure	something	out	for	the	next	10	years	,	and	try	it	.
No	matter	who	pays	for	it	,	we	better	start	doing	care	in	a	fundamentally	different	way	and	treating	the	home	and	the	patient	and	the	family	member	and	the	caregivers	as	part	of	these	coordinated	care	teams
and	using	disruptive	technologies	that	are	already	here	to	do	care	in	some	pretty	fundamental	different	ways	.
The	president	needs	to	stand	up	and	say	,	at	the	end	of	a	healthcare	reform	debate	,	``	Our	goal	as	a	country	is	to	move	50	percent	of	care	out	of	institutions	,	clinics	,	hospitals	and	nursing	homes	,	to	the	home	,	in	10	years	.	''
It	's	achievable	.	We	should	do	it	economically	,
we	should	do	it	morally	,
and	we	should	do	it	for	quality	of	life	.
But	there	is	no	goal	within	this	health	reform	.
It	's	just	a	mess	today	.
So	,	you	know	,	that	's	my	last	message	to	you	.
How	do	we	set	a	going-to-the-moon	goal	of	dealing	with	the	Y2K	+10	problem	that	's	coming	?
It	's	not	that	innovation	and	technology	is	going	to	be	the	magic	pill	that	cures	all	,	but	it	's	going	to	be	part	of	the	solution	.
And	if	we	do	n't	create	a	personal	health	movement	,	something	that	we	're	all	aiming	towards	in	reform	,	then	we	're	going	to	move	nowhere	.
So	,	I	hope	you	'll	turn	this	conference	into	that	kind	of	movement	forward	.
Thanks	very	much	.
The	job	of	uncovering	the	global	food	waste	scandal	started	for	me	when	I	was	15	years	old	.
I	bought	some	pigs	.	I	was	living	in	Sussex	.
And	I	started	to	feed	them	in	the	most	traditional	and	environmentally	friendly	way	.
I	went	to	my	school	kitchen	,	and	I	said	,	``	Give	me	the	scraps	that	my	school	friends	have	turned	their	noses	up	at	.	''	I	went	to	the	local	baker	and	took	their	stale	bread	.
I	went	to	the	local	greengrocer	,	and	I	went	to	a	farmer	who	was	throwing	away	potatoes	because	they	were	the	wrong	shape	or	size	for	supermarkets	.
This	was	great	.	My	pigs	turned	that	food	waste	into	delicious	pork	.	I	sold	that	pork	to	my	school	friends	'	parents	,	and	I	made	a	good	pocket	money	addition	to	my	teenage	allowance	.
But	I	noticed	that	most	of	the	food	that	I	was	giving	my	pigs	was	in	fact	fit	for	human	consumption	,	and	that	I	was	only	scratching	the	surface	,	and	that	right	the	way	up	the	food	supply	chain	,	in	supermarkets	,	greengrocers	,	bakers	,	in	our	homes	,	in	factories	and	farms	,	we	were	hemorrhaging	out	food	.
Supermarkets	did	n't	even	want	to	talk	to	me	about	how	much	food	they	were	wasting	.
I	'd	been	round	the	back	.	I	'd	seen	bins	full	of	food	being	locked	and	then	trucked	off	to	landfill	sites	,	and	I	thought	,	surely	there	is	something	more	sensible	to	do	with	food	than	waste	it	.
One	morning	,	when	I	was	feeding	my	pigs	,	I	noticed	a	particularly	tasty-looking	sun-dried	tomato	loaf	that	used	to	crop	up	from	time	to	time	.
I	grabbed	hold	of	it	,	sat	down	,	and	ate	my	breakfast	with	my	pigs	.
That	was	the	first	act	of	what	I	later	learned	to	call	freeganism	,	really	an	exhibition	of	the	injustice	of	food	waste	,	and	the	provision	of	the	solution	to	food	waste	,	which	is	simply	to	sit	down	and	eat	food	,	rather	than	throwing	it	away	.
That	became	,	as	it	were	,	a	way	of	confronting	large	businesses	in	the	business	of	wasting	food	,	and	exposing	,	most	importantly	,	to	the	public	,	that	when	we	're	talking	about	food	being	thrown	away	,	we	're	not	talking	about	rotten	stuff	,	we	're	not	talking	about	stuff	that	's	beyond	the	pale	.
We	're	talking	about	good	,	fresh	food	that	is	being	wasted	on	a	colossal	scale	.
Eventually	,	I	set	about	writing	my	book	,	really	to	demonstrate	the	extent	of	this	problem
on	a	global	scale	.	What	this	shows	is	a	nation-by-nation	breakdown	of	the	likely	level	of	food	waste	in	each	country	in	the	world	.
Unfortunately	,	empirical	data	,	good	,	hard	stats	,	do	n't	exist	,
and	therefore	to	prove	my	point	,	I	first	of	all	had	to	find	some	proxy	way	of	uncovering	how	much	food	was	being	wasted	.
So	I	took	the	food	supply	of	every	single	country	and	I	compared	it	to	what	was	actually	likely	to	be	being	consumed	in	each	country	.
That	's	based	on	diet	intake	surveys	,	it	's	based	on	levels	of	obesity	,	it	's	based	on	a	range	of	factors	that	gives	you	an	approximate	guess	as	to	how	much	food	is	actually	going	into	people	's	mouths	.
That	black	line	in	the	middle	of	that	table	is	the	likely	level	of	consumption	with	an	allowance	for	certain	levels	of	inevitable	waste	.
There	will	always	be	waste	.	I	'm	not	that	unrealistic	that	I	think	we	can	live	in	a	waste-free	world	.
But	that	black	line	shows	what	a	food	supply	should	be	in	a	country	if	they	allow	for	a	good	,	stable	,	secure	,	nutritional	diet	for	every	person	in	that	country	.
Any	dot	above	that	line	,	and	you	'll	quickly	notice	that	that	includes	most	countries	in	the	world	,	represents	unnecessary	surplus	,	and	is	likely	to	reflect	levels	of	waste	in	each	country	.
As	a	country	gets	richer	,	it	invests	more	and	more	in	getting	more	and	more	surplus	into	its	shops	and	restaurants	,	and	as	you	can	see	,	most	European	and	North	American	countries	fall	between	150	and	200	percent	of	the	nutritional	requirements	of	their	populations	.
So	a	country	like	America	has	twice	as	much	food	on	its	shop	shelves	and	in	its	restaurants	than	is	actually	required	to	feed	the	American	people	.
But	the	thing	that	really	struck	me	,	when	I	plotted	all	this	data	,	and	it	was	a	lot	of	numbers	,	was	that	you	can	see	how	it	levels	off	.
Countries	rapidly	shoot	towards	that	150	mark	,	and	then	they	level	off	,	and	they	do	n't	really	go	on	rising	as	you	might	expect	.
So	I	decided	to	unpack	that	data	a	little	bit	further	to	see	if	that	was	true	or	false	.
And	that	's	what	I	came	up	with	.
If	you	include	not	just	the	food	that	ends	up	in	shops	and	restaurants	,	but	also	the	food	that	people	feed	to	livestock	,	the	maize	,	the	soy	,	the	wheat	,	that	humans	could	eat	but	choose	to	fatten	livestock	instead	to	produce	increasing	amounts	of	meat	and	dairy	products	,	what	you	find	is	that	most	rich	countries	have	between	three	and	four	times	the	amount	of	food	that	their	population	needs	to	feed	itself	.
A	country	like	America	has	four	times	the	amount	of	food	that	it	needs	.
When	people	talk	about	the	need	to	increase	global	food	production	to	feed	those	nine	billion	people	that	are	expected	on	the	planet	by	2050	,	I	always	think	of	these	graphs	.
The	fact	is	,	we	have	an	enormous	buffer	in	rich	countries	between	ourselves	and	hunger	.
We	've	never	had	such	gargantuan	surpluses	before	.
In	many	ways	,	this	is	a	great	success	story	of	human	civilization	,	of	the	agricultural	surpluses	that	we	set	out	to	achieve	12,000	years	ago	.
It	is	a	success	story	.	It	has	been	a	success	story	.
But	what	we	have	to	recognize	now	is	that	we	are	reaching	the	ecological	limits	that	our	planet	can	bear	,	and	when	we	chop	down	forests	,	as	we	are	every	day	,	to	grow	more	and	more	food	,	when	we	extract	water	from	depleting	water	reserves	,	when	we	emit	fossil	fuel	emissions	in	the	quest	to	grow	more	and	more	food	,	and	then	we	throw	away	so	much	of	it	,	we	have	to	think	about	what	we	can	start	saving	.
And	yesterday	,	I	went	to	one	of	the	local	supermarkets	that	I	often	visit	to	inspect	,	if	you	like	,	what	they	're	throwing	away	.
I	found	quite	a	few	packets	of	biscuits	amongst	all	the	fruit	and	vegetables	and	everything	else	that	was	in	there	.
And	I	thought	,	well	this	could	serve	as	a	symbol	for	today	.
So	I	want	you	to	imagine	that	these	nine	biscuits	that	I	found	in	the	bin	represent	the	global	food	supply	,
okay	?	We	start	out	with	nine	.
That	's	what	's	in	fields	around	the	world	every	single	year	.
The	first	biscuit	we	're	going	to	lose	before	we	even	leave	the	farm	.
That	's	a	problem	primarily	associated	with	developing	work	agriculture	,	whether	it	's	a	lack	of	infrastructure	,	refrigeration	,	pasteurization	,	grain	stores	,	even	basic	fruit	crates	,	which	means
that	food	goes	to	waste	before	it	even	leaves	the	fields	.
The	next	three	biscuits	are	the	foods	that	we	decide	to	feed	to	livestock	,	the	maize	,	the	wheat	and	the	soya	.
Unfortunately	,	our	beasts	are	inefficient	animals	,	and	they	turn	two-thirds	of	that	into	feces	and	heat	,
so	we	've	lost	those	two	,	and	we	've	only	kept	this	one	in	meat	and	dairy	products	.
Two	more	we	're	going	to	throw	away	directly	into	bins	.
This	is	what	most	of	us	think	of	when	we	think	of	food	waste	,	what	ends	up	in	the	garbage	,	what	ends	up	in	supermarket	bins	,	what	ends	up	in	restaurant	bins	.	We	've	lost	another	two	,	and	we	've	left	ourselves	with	just	four	biscuits	to	feed	on	.
That	is	not	a	superlatively	efficient	use	of	global	resources	,	especially	when	you	think	of	the	billion	hungry	people	that	exist	already	in	the	world	.
Having	gone	through	the	data	,	I	then	needed	to	demonstrate	where	that	food	ends	up	.
Where	does	it	end	up	?	We	're	used	to	seeing	the	stuff
on	our	plates	,	but	what	about	all	the	stuff	that	goes	missing	in	between	?
Supermarkets	are	an	easy	place	to	start	.
This	is	the	result	of	my	hobby	,	which	is	unofficial	bin	inspections	.
Strange	you	might	think	,	but	if	we	could	rely	on	corporations	to	tell	us	what	they	were	doing	in	the	back	of	their	stores	,	we	would	n't	need	to	go	sneaking	around	the	back	,	opening	up	bins	and	having	a	look	at	what	's	inside	.
But	this	is	what	you	can	see	more	or	less	on	every	street	corner	in	Britain	,	in	Europe	,	in	North	America	.
It	represents	a	colossal	waste	of	food	,	but	what	I	discovered	whilst	I	was	writing	my	book	was	that	this	very	evident	abundance	of	waste	was	actually	the	tip	of	the	iceberg	.
When	you	start	going	up	the	supply	chain	,	you	find	where	the	real	food	waste	is	happening	on	a	gargantuan	scale	.
Can	I	have	a	show	of	hands	if	you	have	a	loaf	of	sliced	bread	in	your	house	?
Who	lives	in	a	household	where	that	crust	--	that	slice	at	the	first	and	last	end	of	each	loaf	--	who	lives	in	a	household	where	it	does	get	eaten	?
Okay	,	most	people	,	not	everyone	,	but	most	people	,	and	this	is	,	I	'm	glad	to	say	,	what	I	see	across	the	world	,
and	yet	has	anyone	seen	a	supermarket	or	sandwich	shop	anywhere	in	the	world	that	serves	sandwiches	with	crusts	on	it	?
I	certainly	have	n't	.
So	I	kept	on	thinking	,	where	do	those	crusts	go	?
This	is	the	answer	,	unfortunately	:	13,000	slices	of	fresh	bread	coming	out	of	this	one	single	factory	every	single	day	,	day-fresh	bread	.
In	the	same	year	that	I	visited	this	factory	,	I	went	to	Pakistan	,	where	people	in	2008	were	going	hungry	as	a	result	of	a	squeeze	on	global	food	supplies	.
We	contribute	to	that	squeeze	by	depositing	food	in	bins	here	in	Britain	and	elsewhere	in	the	world	.	We	take	food
off	the	market	shelves	that	hungry	people	depend	on	.
Go	one	step	up	,	and	you	get	to	farmers	,	who	throw	away	sometimes	a	third	or	even	more	of	their	harvest	because	of	cosmetic	standards	.
This	farmer	,	for	example	,	has	invested	16,000	pounds	in	growing	spinach	,	not	one	leaf	of	which	he	harvested	,	because	there	was	a	little	bit	of	grass	growing	in	amongst	it	.
Potatoes	that	are	cosmetically	imperfect	,	all	going	for	pigs	.
Parsnips	that	are	too	small	for	supermarket	specifications	,	tomatoes	in	Tenerife	,	oranges	in	Florida	,	bananas	in	Ecuador	,	where	I	visited	last	year	,	all	being	discarded	.	This	is	one	day	's	waste	from	one	banana	plantation	in	Ecuador	.
All	being	discarded	,	perfectly	edible	,	because	they	're	the	wrong	shape	or	size	.
If	we	do	that	to	fruit	and	vegetables	,	you	bet	we	can	do	it	to	animals	too	.
Liver	,	lungs	,	heads	,	tails	,	kidneys	,	testicles	,	all	of	these	things	which	are	traditional	,	delicious	and	nutritious	parts	of	our	gastronomy	go	to	waste	.	Offal	consumption	has	halved	in	Britain	and	America	in	the	last	30	years	.
As	a	result	,	this	stuff	gets	fed	to	dogs	at	best	,	or	is	incinerated	.
This	man	,	in	Kashgar	,	Xinjiang	province	,	in	Western	China	,	is	serving	up	his	national	dish	.
It	's	called	sheep	's	organs	.
It	's	delicious	,	it	's	nutritious	,	and	as	I	learned	when	I	went	to	Kashgar	,	it	symbolizes	their	taboo	against	food	waste	.
I	was	sitting	in	a	roadside	cafe	.
A	chef	came	to	talk	to	me	,	I	finished	my	bowl	,	and	halfway	through	the	conversation	,	he	stopped	talking	and	he	started	frowning	into	my	bowl	.
I	thought	,	``	My	goodness	,	what	taboo	have	I	broken	?
How	have	I	insulted	my	host	?	''	He	pointed	at	three	grains	of	rice	at	the	bottom	of	my	bowl	,	and	he	said	,	``	Clean	.	''	I	thought	,	``	My	God	,	you	know	,	I	go	around	the	world	telling	people	to	stop	wasting	food	.
This	guy	has	thrashed	me	at	my	own	game	.	''	But	it	gave	me	faith	.	It	gave	me	faith	that	we	,	the	people	,	do	have	the	power	to	stop	this	tragic	waste	of	resources	if	we	regard	it	as	socially	unacceptable	to	waste	food	on	a	colossal	scale	,	if	we	make	noise	about	it	,	tell	corporations	about	it	,	tell	governments	we	want	to	see	an	end	to	food	waste	,	we	do	have	the	power	to	bring	about	that	change	.
Fish	,	40	to	60	percent	of	European	fish	are	discarded	at	sea	,	they	do	n't	even	get	landed	.
In	our	homes	,	we	've	lost	touch	with	food	.
This	is	an	experiment	I	did	on	three	lettuces	.
Who	keeps	lettuces	in	their	fridge	?
Most	people	.	The	one	on	the	left
was	kept	in	a	fridge	for	10	days	.
The	one	in	the	middle	,	on	my	kitchen	table	.	Not	much	difference	.
The	one	on	the	right	I	treated	like	cut	flowers	.
It	's	a	living	organism	,	cut	the	slice	off	,	stuck	it	in	a	vase	of	water	,	it	was	all	right	for	another	two	weeks	after	this	.
Some	food	waste	,	as	I	said	at	the	beginning	,	will	inevitably	arise	,	so	the	question	is	,	what	is	the	best	thing	to	do	with	it	?
I	answered	that	question	when	I	was	15	.
In	fact	,	humans	answered	that	question	6,000	years	ago	:	We	domesticated	pigs	to	turn	food	waste	back	into	food	.
And	yet	,	in	Europe	,	that	practice	has	become	illegal	since	2001	as	a	result	of	the	foot-and-mouth	outbreak	.
It	's	unscientific	.	It	's	unnecessary	.
If	you	cook	food	for	pigs	,	just	as	if	you	cook	food	for	humans	,	it	is	rendered	safe	.
It	's	also	a	massive	saving	of	resources	.
At	the	moment	,	Europe	depends	on	importing	millions	of	tons	of	soy	from	South	America	,	where	its	production	contributes	to	global	warming	,	to	deforestation	,	to	biodiversity	loss	,	to	feed	livestock	here	in	Europe	.
At	the	same	time	we	throw	away	millions	of	tons	of	food	waste	which	we	could	and	should	be	feeding	them	.
If	we	did	that	,	and	fed	it	to	pigs	,	we	would	save	that	amount	of	carbon	.
If	we	feed	our	food	waste	which	is	the	current	government	favorite	way	of	getting	rid	of	food	waste	,	to	anaerobic	digestion	,	which	turns	food	waste	into	gas	to	produce	electricity	,	you	save	a	paltry	448	kilograms	of	carbon	dioxide	per	ton	of	food	waste	.	It	's	much	better	to	feed	it	to	pigs	.
We	knew	that	during	the	war	.
A	silver	lining	:	It	has	kicked	off	globally	,	the	quest	to	tackle	food	waste	.
Feeding	the	5,000	is	an	event	I	first	organized	in	2009	.
We	fed	5,000	people	all	on	food	that	otherwise	would	have	been	wasted	.
Since	then	,	it	's	happened	again	in	London	,	it	's	happening	internationally	,	and	across	the	country	.
It	's	a	way	of	organizations	coming	together	to	celebrate	food	,	to	say	the	best	thing	to	do	with	food	is	to	eat	and	enjoy	it	,	and	to	stop	wasting	it	.
For	the	sake	of	the	planet	we	live	on	,	for	the	sake	of	our	children	,	for	the	sake	of	all	the	other	organisms	that	share	our	planet	with	us	,	we	are	a	terrestrial	animal	,	and	we	depend	on	our	land
for	food	.	At	the	moment	,	we	are	trashing	our	land	to	grow	food	that	no	one	eats	.
Stop	wasting	food	.	Thank	you	very	much	.
When	I	was	growing	up	in	Montana	,	I	had	two	dreams	.
I	wanted	to	be	a	paleontologist	,	a	dinosaur	paleontologist	,	and	I	wanted	to	have	a	pet	dinosaur	.
And	so	that	's	what	I	've	been	striving	for	all	of	my	life	.
I	was	very	fortunate	early	in	my	career	.
I	was	fortunate	in	finding	things	.
I	was	n't	very	good	at	reading	things	.
In	fact	,	I	do	n't	read	much	of	anything	.
I	am	extremely	dyslexic	,	and	so	reading	is	the	hardest	thing	I	do	.
But	instead	,	I	go	out	and	I	find	things	.
Then	I	just	pick	things	up	.
I	basically	practice	for	finding	money	on	the	street	.
And	I	wander	about	the	hills	,
and	I	have	found	a	few	things	.
And	I	have	been	fortunate	enough	to	find	things	like	the	first	eggs	in	the	Western	hemisphere	and	the	first	baby	dinosaurs	in	nests	,	the	first	dinosaur	embryos	and	massive	accumulations	of	bones	.
And	it	happened	to	be	at	a	time	when	people	were	just	starting	to	begin	to	realize	that	dinosaurs	were	n't	the	big	,	stupid	,	green	reptiles	that	people	had	thought	for	so	many	years	.
People	were	starting	to	get	an	idea	that	dinosaurs	were	special	.
And	so	,	at	that	time	,	I	was	able	to	make	some	interesting	hypotheses	along	with	my	colleagues	.
We	were	able	to	actually	say	that	dinosaurs	--	based	on	the	evidence	we	had	--	that	dinosaurs	built	nests	and	lived	in	colonies	and	cared	for	their	young	,	brought	food	to	their	babies	and	traveled	in	gigantic	herds	.
So	it	was	pretty	interesting	stuff	.
I	have	gone	on	to	find	more	things	and	discover	that	dinosaurs	really	were	very	social	.
We	have	found	a	lot	of	evidence	that	dinosaurs	changed	from	when	they	were	juveniles	to	when	they	were	adults	.
The	appearance	of	them	would	have	been	different	--	which	it	is	in	all	social	animals	.
In	social	groups	of	animals	,	the	juveniles	always	look	different	than	the	adults	.
The	adults	can	recognize	the	juveniles	;	the	juveniles	can	recognize	the	adults	.
And	so	we	're	making	a	better	picture	of	what	a	dinosaur	looks	like	.
And	they	did	n't	just	all	chase	Jeeps	around	.
But	it	is	that	social	thing	that	I	guess	attracted	Michael	Crichton	.
And	in	his	book	,	he	talked	about	the	social	animals	.
And	then	Steven	Spielberg	,	of	course	,	depicts	these	dinosaurs	as	being	very	social	creatures	.
The	theme	of	this	story	is	building	a	dinosaur	,	and	so	we	come	to	that	part	of	``	Jurassic	Park	.	''
Michael	Crichton	really	was	one	of	the	first	people	to	talk	about	bringing	dinosaurs	back	to	life	.
You	all	know	the	story	,	right	.
I	mean	,	I	assume	everyone	here	has	seen	``	Jurassic	Park	.	''
If	you	want	to	make	a	dinosaur	,	you	go	out	,	you	find	yourself	a	piece	of	petrified	tree	sap	--	otherwise	known	as	amber	--	that	has	some	blood-sucking	insects	in	it	,	good	ones	,	and	you	get	your	insect	and	you	drill	into	it	and	you	suck	out	some	DNA	,	because	obviously	all	insects	that	sucked	blood	in	those	days	sucked	dinosaur	DNA	out	.
And	you	take	your	DNA	back	to	the	laboratory	and	you	clone	it	.
And	I	guess	you	inject	it	into	maybe	an	ostrich	egg	,	or	something	like	that	,
and	then	you	wait	,	and	,	lo	and	behold	,	out	pops	a	little	baby	dinosaur	.
And	everybody	's	happy	about	that	.
And	they	're	happy	over	and	over	again	.
They	keep	doing	it	;	they	just	keep	making	these	things	.
And	then	,	then	,	then	,	and	then	...
Then	the	dinosaurs	,	being	social	,	act	out	their	socialness	,
and	they	get	together	,	and	they	conspire	.	And	,	of	course	,	that	's	what	makes	Steven	Spielberg	's	movie	--	conspiring	dinosaurs	chasing	people	around	.	So	I	assume	everybody	knows	that	if	you	actually	had	a	piece	of	amber	and	it	had	an	insect	in	it	,	and	you	drilled	into	it	,	and	you	got	something	out	of	that	insect	,	and	you	cloned	it	,	and	you	did	it	over	and	over	and	over	again	,	you	'd	have	a	room	full	of	mosquitoes	.
And	probably	a	whole	bunch	of	trees	as	well	.
Now	if	you	want	dinosaur	DNA	,	I	say	go	to	the	dinosaur	.
So	that	's	what	we	've	done	.
Back	in	1993	when	the	movie	came	out	,	we	actually	had	a	grant	from	the	National	Science	Foundation	to	attempt	to	extract	DNA	from	a	dinosaur	,
and	we	chose	the	dinosaur	on	the	left	,	a	Tyrannosaurus	rex	,	which	was	a	very	nice	specimen	.	And	one	of	my	former	doctoral	students	,	Dr.	Mary	Schweitzer	,	actually	had	the	background	to	do	this	sort	of	thing	.
And	so	she	looked	into	the	bone	of	this	T.	rex	,	one	of	the	thigh	bones	,	and	she	actually	found	some	very	interesting	structures	in	there	.
They	found	these	red	circular-looking	objects	,	and	they	looked	,	for	all	the	world	,	like	red	blood	cells	.
And	they	're	in	what	appear	to	be	the	blood	channels	that	go	through	the	bone	.
And	so	she	thought	,	well	,	what	the	heck	.
So	she	sampled	some	material	out	of	it	.
Now	it	was	n't	DNA	;	she	did	n't	find	DNA	.
But	she	did	find	heme	,	which	is	the	biological	foundation	of	hemoglobin	.
And	that	was	really	cool	.
That	was	interesting	.
That	was	--	here	we	have	65-million-year-old	heme	.
Well	we	tried	and	tried	and	we	could	n't	really	get	anything	else	out	of	it	.
So	a	few	years	went	by	,	and	then	we	started	the	Hell	Creek	Project	.
And	the	Hell	Creek	Project	was	this	massive	undertaking	to	get	as	many	dinosaurs	as	we	could	possibly	find	,	and	hopefully	find	some	dinosaurs	that	had	more	material	in	them	.
And	out	in	eastern	Montana	there	's	a	lot	of	space	,	a	lot	of	badlands	,	and	not	very	many	people	,
and	so	you	can	go	out	there	and	find	a	lot	of	stuff	.
And	we	did	find	a	lot	of	stuff	.
We	found	a	lot	of	Tyrannosaurs	,	but	we	found	one	special	Tyrannosaur	,	and	we	called	it	B-rex	.
And	B-rex	was	found	under	a	thousand	cubic	yards	of	rock	.
It	was	n't	a	very	complete	T.	rex	,	and	it	was	n't	a	very	big	T.	rex	,	but	it	was	a	very	special	B-rex	.
And	I	and	my	colleagues	cut	into	it	,	and	we	were	able	to	determine	,	by	looking	at	lines	of	arrested	growth	,	some	lines	in	it	,	that	B-rex	had	died	at	the	age	of	16	.
We	do	n't	really	know	how	long	dinosaurs	lived	,	because	we	have	n't	found	the	oldest	one	yet	.
But	this	one	died	at	the	age	of	16	.
We	gave	samples	to	Mary	Schweitzer	,	and	she	was	actually	able	to	determine	that	B-rex	was	a	female	based	on	medullary	tissue	found	on	the	inside	of	the	bone	.
Medullary	tissue	is	the	calcium	build-up	,	the	calcium	storage	basically	,	when	an	animal	is	pregnant	,	when	a	bird	is	pregnant	.
So	here	was	the	character	that	linked	birds	and	dinosaurs	.
But	Mary	went	further	.
She	took	the	bone	,	and	she	dumped	it	into	acid	.
Now	we	all	know	that	bones	are	fossilized	,	and	so	if	you	dump	it	into	acid	,	there	should	n't	be	anything	left	.
But	there	was	something	left	.
There	were	blood	vessels	left	.
There	were	flexible	,	clear	blood	vessels	.
And	so	here	was	the	first	soft	tissue	from	a	dinosaur	.
It	was	extraordinary	.
But	she	also	found	osteocytes	,	which	are	the	cells	that	laid	down	the	bones	.
And	try	and	try	,	we	could	not	find	DNA	,	but	she	did	find	evidence	of	proteins	.
But	we	thought	maybe	--	well	,	we	thought	maybe	that	the	material	was	breaking	down	after	it	was	coming	out	of	the	ground	.
We	thought	maybe	it	was	deteriorating	very	fast	.
And	so	we	built	a	laboratory	in	the	back	of	an	18-wheeler	trailer	,	and	actually	took	the	laboratory	to	the	field	where	we	could	get	better	samples	.
And	we	did	.	We	got	better	material	.
The	cells	looked	better	.
The	vessels	looked	better	.
Found	the	protein	collagen	.
I	mean	,	it	was	wonderful	stuff	.
But	it	's	not	dinosaur	DNA	.
So	we	have	discovered	that	dinosaur	DNA	,	and	all	DNA	,	just	breaks	down	too	fast	.
We	're	just	not	going	to	be	able	to	do	what	they	did	in	``	Jurassic	Park	.	''
We	're	not	going	to	be	able	to	make	a	dinosaur	based	on	a	dinosaur	.
But	birds	are	dinosaurs	.
Birds	are	living	dinosaurs	.
We	actually	classify	them	as	dinosaurs	.
We	now	call	them	non-avian	dinosaurs	and	avian	dinosaurs	.
So	the	non-avian	dinosaurs	are	the	big	clunky	ones	that	went	extinct	.
Avian	dinosaurs	are	our	modern	birds	.
So	we	do	n't	have	to	make	a	dinosaur	because	we	already	have	them	.
I	know	,	you	're	as	bad	as	the	sixth-graders	.
The	sixth-graders	look	at	it	and	they	say	,	``	No	.	''
``	You	can	call	it	a	dinosaur	,	but	look	at	the	velociraptor	:	the	velociraptor	is	cool	.	''
``	The	chicken	is	not	.	''
So	this	is	our	problem	,	as	you	can	imagine	.
The	chicken	is	a	dinosaur	.
I	mean	it	really	is	.
You	ca	n't	argue	with	it	because	we	're	the	classifiers	and	we	've	classified	it	that	way	.
But	the	sixth-graders	demand	it	.
``	Fix	the	chicken	.	''
So	that	's	what	I	'm	here	to	tell	you	about	:	how	we	are	going	to	fix	a	chicken	.
So	we	have	a	number	of	ways	that	we	actually	can	fix	the	chicken	.
Because	evolution	works	,	we	actually	have	some	evolutionary	tools	.
We	'll	call	them	biological	modification	tools	.
We	have	selection	.
And	we	know	selection	works	.
We	started	out	with	a	wolf-like	creature	and	we	ended	up	with	a	Maltese	.
I	mean	,	that	's	--	that	's	definitely	genetic	modification	.
Or	any	of	the	other	funny-looking	little	dogs	.
We	also	have	transgenesis	.
Transgenesis	is	really	cool	too	.
That	's	where	you	take	a	gene	out	of	one	animal	and	stick	it	in	another	one	.
That	's	how	people	make	GloFish	.
You	take	a	glow	gene	out	of	a	coral	or	a	jellyfish	and	you	stick	it	in	a	zebrafish	,	and	,	puff	,	they	glow	.
And	that	's	pretty	cool	.
And	they	obviously	make	a	lot	of	money	off	of	them	.
And	now	they	're	making	Glow-rabbits	and	Glow-all-sorts-of-things	.
I	guess	we	could	make	a	glow	chicken	.
But	I	do	n't	think	that	'll	satisfy	the	sixth-graders	either	.
But	there	's	another	thing	.
There	's	what	we	call	atavism	activation	.
And	atavism	activation	is	basically	--	an	atavism	is	an	ancestral	characteristic	.
You	heard	that	occasionally	children	are	born	with	tails	,	and	it	's	because	it	's	an	ancestral	characteristic	.
And	so	there	are	a	number	of	atavisms	that	can	happen	.
Snakes	are	occasionally	born	with	legs	.
And	here	's	an	example	.
This	is	a	chicken	with	teeth	.
A	fellow	by	the	name	of	Matthew	Harris	at	the	University	of	Wisconsin	in	Madison	actually	figured	out	a	way	to	stimulate	the	gene	for	teeth	,	and	so	was	able	to	actually	turn	the	tooth	gene	on	and	produce	teeth	in	chickens	.
Now	that	's	a	good	characteristic	.
We	can	save	that	one	.
We	know	we	can	use	that	.
We	can	make	a	chicken	with	teeth	.
That	's	getting	closer	.
That	's	better	than	a	glowing	chicken	.
A	friend	of	mine	,	a	colleague	of	mine	,	Dr.	Hans	Larsson	at	McGill	University	,	is	actually	looking	at	atavisms	.
And	he	's	looking	at	them	by	looking	at	the	embryo	genesis	of	birds	and	actually	looking	at	how	they	develop	,
and	he	's	interested	in	how	birds	actually	lost	their	tail	.
He	's	also	interested	in	the	transformation	of	the	arm	,	the	hand	,	to	the	wing	.
He	's	looking	for	those	genes	as	well	.
And	I	said	,	``	Well	,	if	you	can	find	those	,	I	can	just	reverse	them	and	make	what	I	need	to	make	for	the	sixth-graders	.	''
And	so	he	agreed	.
And	so	that	's	what	we	're	looking	into	.
If	you	look	at	dinosaur	hands	,	a	velociraptor	has	that	cool-looking	hand	with	the	claws	on	it	.
Archaeopteryx	,	which	is	a	bird	,	a	primitive	bird	,	still	has	that	very	primitive	hand	.
But	as	you	can	see	,	the	pigeon	,	or	a	chicken	or	anything	else	,	another	bird	,	has	kind	of	a	weird-looking	hand	,	because	the	hand	is	a	wing	.
But	the	cool	thing	is	that	,	if	you	look	in	the	embryo	,	as	the	embryo	is	developing	the	hand	actually	looks	pretty	much	like	the	archaeopteryx	hand	.
It	has	the	three	fingers	,	the	three	digits	.
But	a	gene	turns	on	that	actually	fuses	those	together	.
And	so	what	we	're	looking	for	is	that	gene	.
We	want	to	stop	that	gene	from	turning	on	,	fusing	those	hands	together	,	so	we	can	get	a	chicken	that	hatches	out	with	a	three-fingered	hand	,	like	the	archaeopteryx	.
And	the	same	goes	for	the	tails	.
Birds	have	basically	rudimentary	tails	.
And	so	we	know	that	in	embryo	,	as	the	animal	is	developing	,	it	actually	has	a	relatively	long	tail	.
But	a	gene	turns	on	and	resorbs	the	tail	,	gets	rid	of	it	.
So	that	's	the	other	gene	we	're	looking	for	.
We	want	to	stop	that	tail	from	resorbing	.
So	what	we	're	trying	to	do	really	is	take	our	chicken	,	modify	it	and	make	the	chickenosaurus	.
It	's	a	cooler-looking	chicken	.
But	it	's	just	the	very	basics	.
So	that	really	is	what	we	're	doing	.
And	people	always	say	,	``	Why	do	that	?
Why	make	this	thing	?
What	good	is	it	?	''
Well	,	that	's	a	good	question	.
Actually	,	I	think	it	's	a	great	way	to	teach	kids	about	evolutionary	biology	and	developmental	biology	and	all	sorts	of	things	.
And	quite	frankly	,	I	think	if	Colonel	Sanders	was	to	be	careful	how	he	worded	it	,	he	could	actually	advertise	an	extra	piece	.
Anyway	--	When	our	dino-chicken	hatches	,	it	will	be	,	obviously	,	the	poster	child	,	or	what	you	might	call	a	poster	chick	,	for	technology	,	entertainment	and	design	.
Thank	you	.
So	,	this	book	that	I	have	in	my	hand	is	a	directory	of	everybody	who	had	an	email	address	in	1982	.
Actually	,	it	's	deceptively	large	.
There	's	actually	only	about	20	people	on	each	page	,	because	we	have	the	name	,	address	and	telephone	number	of	every	single	person	.
And	,	in	fact	,	everybody	's	listed	twice	,	because	it	's	sorted	once	by	name	and	once	by	email	address	.
Obviously	a	very	small	community	.
There	were	only	two	other	Dannys	on	the	Internet	then	.
I	knew	them	both	.
We	did	n't	all	know	each	other	,	but	we	all	kind	of	trusted	each	other	,	and	that	basic	feeling	of	trust	permeated	the	whole	network	,	and	there	was	a	real	sense	that	we	could	depend	on	each	other	to	do	things	.
So	just	to	give	you	an	idea	of	the	level	of	trust	in	this	community	,	let	me	tell	you	what	it	was	like	to	register	a	domain	name	in	the	early	days	.
Now	,	it	just	so	happened	that	I	got	to	register	the	third	domain	name	on	the	Internet	.
So	I	could	have	anything	I	wanted	other	than	bbn.com	and	symbolics.com	.
So	I	picked	think.com	,	but	then	I	thought	,	you	know	,	there	's	a	lot	of	really	interesting	names	out	there	.
Maybe	I	should	register	a	few	extras	just	in	case	.
And	then	I	thought	,	``	Nah	,	that	would	n't	be	very	nice	.	''	That	attitude	of	only	taking	what	you	need	was	really	what	everybody	had	on	the	network	in	those	days	,	and	in	fact	,	it	was	n't	just	the	people	on	the	network	,	but	it	was	actually	kind	of	built	into	the	protocols	of	the	Internet	itself	.
So	the	basic	idea	of	I.P.	,	or	Internet	protocol	,	and	the	way	that	the	--	the	routing	algorithm	that	used	it	,	were	fundamentally	``	from	each	according	to	their	ability	,	to	each	according	to	their	need	.	''	And	so	,	if	you	had	some	extra	bandwidth	,	you	'd	deliver	a	message	for	someone	.
If	they	had	some	extra	bandwidth	,	they	would	deliver	a	message	for	you	.
You	'd	kind	of	depend	on	people	to	do	that	,	and	that	was	the	building	block	.
It	was	actually	interesting	that	such	a	communist	principle	was	the	basis	of	a	system	developed	during	the	Cold	War	by	the	Defense	Department	,	but	it	obviously	worked	really	well	,	and	we	all	saw	what	happened	with	the	Internet	.
It	was	incredibly	successful	.
In	fact	,	it	was	so	successful	that	there	's	no	way	that	these	days	you	could	make	a	book	like	this	.
My	rough	calculation	is	it	would	be	about	25	miles	thick	.
But	,	of	course	,	you	could	n't	do	it	,	because	we	do	n't	know	the	names	of	all	the	people	with	Internet	or	email	addresses	,	and	even	if	we	did	know	their	names	,	I	'm	pretty	sure	that	they	would	not	want	their	name	,	address	and	telephone	number	published	to	everyone	.
So	the	fact	is	that	there	's	a	lot	of	bad	guys	on	the	Internet	these	days	,	and	so	we	dealt	with	that	by	making	walled	communities	,	secure	subnetworks	,	VPNs	,	little	things	that	are	n't	really	the	Internet	but	are	made	out	of	the	same	building	blocks	,	but	we	're	still	basically	building	it	out	of	those	same	building	blocks	with	those	same	assumptions	of	trust	.
And	that	means	that	it	's	vulnerable	to	certain	kinds	of	mistakes	that	can	happen	,	or	certain	kinds	of	deliberate	attacks	,	but	even	the	mistakes	can	be	bad	.
So	,	for	instance	,	in	all	of	Asia	recently	,	it	was	impossible	to	get	YouTube	for	a	little	while	because	Pakistan	made	some	mistakes	in	how	it	was	censoring	YouTube	in	its	internal	network	.
They	did	n't	intend	to	screw	up	Asia	,	but	they	did	because	of	the	way	that	the	protocols	work	.
Another	example	that	may	have	affected	many	of	you	in	this	audience	is	,	you	may	remember	a	couple	of	years	ago	,	all	the	planes	west	of	the	Mississippi	were	grounded	because	a	single	routing	card	in	Salt	Lake	City	had	a	bug	in	it	.
Now	,	you	do	n't	really	think	that	our	airplane	system	depends	on	the	Internet	,	and	in	some	sense	it	does	n't	.
I	'll	come	back	to	that	later	.
But	the	fact	is	that	people	could	n't	take	off	because	something	was	going	wrong	on	the	Internet	,	and	the	router	card	was	down	.
And	so	,	there	are	many	of	those	things	that	start	to	happen	.
Now	,	there	was	an	interesting	thing	that	happened	last	April	.
All	of	a	sudden	,	a	very	large	percentage	of	the	traffic	on	the	whole	Internet	,	including	a	lot	of	the	traffic	between	U.S.	military	installations	,	started	getting	re-routed	through	China	.
So	for	a	few	hours	,	it	all	passed	through	China	.
Now	,	China	Telecom	says	it	was	just	an	honest	mistake	,	and	it	is	actually	possible	that	it	was	,	the	way	things	work	,	but	certainly	somebody	could	make	a	dishonest	mistake	of	that	sort	if	they	wanted	to	,	and	it	shows	you	how	vulnerable	the	system	is	even	to	mistakes	.
Imagine	how	vulnerable	the	system	is	to	deliberate	attacks	.
So	if	somebody	really	wanted	to	attack	the	United	States	or	Western	civilization	these	days	,	they	're	not	going	to	do	it	with	tanks	.
That	will	not	succeed	.
What	they	'll	probably	do	is	something	very	much	like	the	attack	that	happened	on	the	Iranian	nuclear	facility	.
Nobody	has	claimed	credit	for	that	.
There	was	basically	a	factory	of	industrial	machines	.
It	did	n't	think	of	itself	as	being	on	the	Internet	.
It	thought	of	itself	as	being	disconnected	from	the	Internet	,	but	it	was	possible	for	somebody	to	smuggle	a	USB	drive	in	there	,	or	something	like	that	,	and	software	got	in	there	that	causes	the	centrifuges	,	in	that	case	,	to	actually	destroy	themselves	.
Now	that	same	kind	of	software	could	destroy	an	oil	refinery	or	a	pharmaceutical	factory	or	a	semiconductor	plant	.
And	so	there	's	a	lot	of	--	I	'm	sure	you	've	read	a	lot	in	papers	,	about	worries	about	cyber	attacks	and	defenses	against	those	.
But	the	fact	is	,	people	are	mostly	focused	on	defending	the	computers	on	the	Internet	,	and	there	's	been	surprisingly	little	attention	to	defending	the	Internet	itself	as	a	communications	medium	.
And	I	think	we	probably	do	need	to	pay	some	more	attention	to	that	,	because	it	's	actually	kind	of	fragile	.
So	actually	,	in	the	early	days	,	back	when	it	was	the	ARPANET	,	there	were	actually	times	--	there	was	a	particular	time	it	failed	completely	because	one	single	message	processor	actually	got	a	bug	in	it	.
And	the	way	the	Internet	works	is	the	routers	are	basically	exchanging	information	about	how	they	can	get	messages	to	places	,	and	this	one	processor	,	because	of	a	broken	card	,	decided	it	could	actually	get	a	message	to	some	place	in	negative	time	.
So	,	in	other	words	,	it	claimed	it	could	deliver	a	message	before	you	sent	it	.
So	of	course	,	the	fastest	way	to	get	a	message	anywhere	was	to	send	it	to	this	guy	,	who	would	send	it	back	in	time	and	get	it	there	super	early	,	so	every	message	in	the	Internet	started	getting	switched	through	this	one	node	,	and	of	course	that	clogged	everything	up	.
Everything	started	breaking	.
The	interesting	thing	was	,	though	,	that	the	sysadmins	were	able	to	fix	it	,	but	they	had	to	basically	turn	every	single	thing	on	the	Internet	off	.
Now	,	of	course	you	could	n't	do	that	today	.
I	mean	,	everything	off	,	it	's	like	the	service	call	you	get	from	the	cable	company	,	except	for	the	whole	world	.
Now	,	in	fact	,	they	could	n't	do	it	for	a	lot	of	reasons	today	.
One	of	the	reasons	is	a	lot	of	their	telephones	use	IP	protocol	and	use	things	like	Skype	and	so	on	that	go	through	the	Internet	right	now	,	and	so	in	fact	we	're	becoming	dependent	on	it	for	more	and	more	different	things	,	like	when	you	take	off	from	LAX	,	you	're	really	not	thinking	you	're	using	the	Internet	.
When	you	pump	gas	,	you	really	do	n't	think	you	're	using	the	Internet	.
What	's	happening	increasingly	,	though	,	is	these	systems	are	beginning	to	use	the	Internet	.
Most	of	them	are	n't	based	on	the	Internet	yet	,	but	they	're	starting	to	use	the	Internet	for	service	functions	,	for	administrative	functions	,	and	so	if	you	take	something	like	the	cell	phone	system	,	which	is	still	relatively	independent	of	the	Internet	for	the	most	part	,	Internet	pieces	are	beginning	to	sneak	into	it	in	terms	of	some	of	the	control	and	administrative	functions	,
and	it	's	so	tempting	to	use	these	same	building	blocks	because	they	work	so	well	,	they	're	cheap	,	they	're	repeated	,	and	so	on	.
So	all	of	our	systems	,	more	and	more	,	are	starting	to	use	the	same	technology	and	starting	to	depend	on	this	technology	.
And	so	even	a	modern	rocket	ship	these	days	actually	uses	Internet	protocol	to	talk	from	one	end	of	the	rocket	ship	to	the	other	.
That	's	crazy	.	It	was	never	designed	to	do	things	like	that	.
So	we	've	built	this	system	where	we	understand	all	the	parts	of	it	,	but	we	're	using	it	in	a	very	,	very	different	way	than	we	expected	to	use	it	,	and	it	's	gotten	a	very	,	very	different	scale	than	it	was	designed	for	.
And	in	fact	,	nobody	really	exactly	understands	all	the	things	it	's	being	used	for	right	now	.
It	's	turning	into	one	of	these	big	emergent	systems	like	the	financial	system	,	where	we	've	designed	all	the	parts	but	nobody	really	exactly	understands	how	it	operates	and	all	the	little	details	of	it	and	what	kinds	of	emergent	behaviors	it	can	have	.
And	so	if	you	hear	an	expert	talking	about	the	Internet	and	saying	it	can	do	this	,	or	it	does	do	this	,	or	it	will	do	that	,	you	should	treat	it	with	the	same	skepticism	that	you	might	treat	the	comments	of	an	economist	about	the	economy	or	a	weatherman	about	the	weather	,	or	something	like	that	.
They	have	an	informed	opinion	,	but	it	's	changing	so	quickly	that	even	the	experts	do	n't	know	exactly	what	's	going	on	.
So	if	you	see	one	of	these	maps	of	the	Internet	,	it	's	just	somebody	's	guess	.
Nobody	really	knows	what	the	Internet	is	right	now	because	it	's	different	than	it	was	an	hour	ago	.
It	's	constantly	changing	.	It	's	constantly	reconfiguring	.
And	the	problem	with	it	is	,	I	think	we	are	setting	ourselves	up	for	a	kind	of	disaster	like	the	disaster	we	had	in	the	financial	system	,	where	we	take	a	system	that	's	basically	built	on	trust	,	was	basically	built	for	a	smaller-scale	system	,	and	we	've	kind	of	expanded	it	way	beyond	the	limits	of	how	it	was	meant	to	operate	.
And	so	right	now	,	I	think	it	's	literally	true	that	we	do	n't	know	what	the	consequences	of	an	effective	denial-of-service	attack	on	the	Internet	would	be	,	and	whatever	it	would	be	is	going	to	be	worse	next	year	,	and	worse	next	year	,	and	so	on	.
But	so	what	we	need	is	a	plan	B	.
There	is	no	plan	B	right	now	.
There	's	no	clear	backup	system	that	we	've	very	carefully	kept	to	be	independent	of	the	Internet	,	made	out	of	completely	different	sets	of	building	blocks	.
So	what	we	need	is	something	that	does	n't	necessarily	have	to	have	the	performance	of	the	Internet	,	but	the	police	department	has	to	be	able	to	call	up	the	fire	department	even	without	the	Internet	,	or	the	hospitals	have	to	order	fuel	oil	.
This	does	n't	need	to	be	a	multi-billion-dollar	government	project	.
It	's	actually	relatively	simple	to	do	,	technically	,	because	it	can	use	existing	fibers	that	are	in	the	ground	,	existing	wireless	infrastructure	.
It	's	basically	a	matter	of	deciding	to	do	it	.
But	people	wo	n't	decide	to	do	it	until	they	recognize	the	need	for	it	,	and	that	's	the	problem	that	we	have	right	now	.
So	there	's	been	plenty	of	people	,	plenty	of	us	have	been	quietly	arguing	that	we	should	have	this	independent	system	for	years	,	but	it	's	very	hard	to	get	people	focused	on	plan	B	when	plan	A	seems	to	be	working	so	well	.
So	I	think	that	,	if	people	understand	how	much	we	're	starting	to	depend	on	the	Internet	,	and	how	vulnerable	it	is	,	we	could	get	focused	on	just	wanting	this	other	system	to	exist	,	and	I	think	if	enough	people	say	,	``	Yeah	,	I	would	like	to	use	it	,	I	'd	like	to	have	such	a	system	,	''	then	it	will	get	built	.
It	's	not	that	hard	a	problem	.
It	could	definitely	be	done	by	people	in	this	room	.
And	so	I	think	that	this	is	actually	,	of	all	the	problems	you	're	going	to	hear	about	at	the	conference	,	this	is	probably	one	of	the	very	easiest	to	fix	.
So	I	'm	happy	to	get	a	chance	to	tell	you	about	it	.
Thank	you	very	much	.
I	am	going	to	be	talking	about	secrets	.
Obviously	the	best	way	to	divulge	a	secret	is	to	tell	someone	to	not	say	anything	about	it	.
Secrets	.	I	'm	using	PowerPoint	this	year	just	because	,	you	know	,	I	'm	into	the	TED	thing	.
And	when	you	use	these	things	you	do	n't	have	to	go	like	that	.
You	just	press	it	.
Oh	,	man	.	Um	,	yes	.
Yes	.	I	'm	sure	!	Just	change	it	!
Is	Bill	Gates	here	?
Change	it	!	Come	on	!	What	?
Ah	!	Okay	.
That	's	not	my	slides	,	but	it	's	okay	.
As	you	can	see	,	these	are	all	maps	.
And	maps	are	important	devices	for	transferring	information	,	especially	if	you	have	human	cognitive	ability	.
We	can	see	that	all	formulas	are	really	maps	.
Now	,	as	humans	,	we	make	maps	of	places	that	we	seldom	even	go	,
which	seems	a	little	wasteful	of	time	.
This	,	of	course	,	is	a	map	of	the	moon	.
There	're	some	very	delightful	names	.
Tranquilacalitis	,	[	unclear	]	.	My	favorite	is	Frigoris	.
What	are	these	people	thinking	?	Frigoris	?
What	the	Frigoris	you	doing	?	Names	are	important	.
Frigoris	?	This	is	the	Moon	.	People	could	live	there	one	day	.
I	'll	meet	you	at	Frigoris	.	No	.	I	do	n't	think	so	.
There	we	see	Mars	,	again	with	various	names	.
And	this	is	all	done	,	by	the	way	,	by	the	International	Astronomical	Union	.
This	is	an	actual	group	of	people	that	sit	around	naming	planetary	objects	.
This	is	from	their	actual	book	.
These	are	some	of	the	names	that	they	have	chosen	,	ladies	and	gentlemen	.
I	'll	go	through	a	little	of	them	.	Bolotnitsa	.
That	,	of	course	,	is	the	Slavic	swamp	mermaid	.
Now	I	think	the	whole	concept	of	a	mermaid	does	n't	really	blend	into	the	swamp	feel	.
``	Oh	look	!	Mermaid	come	out	of	swamp	.	Oh	boy	!
It	's	time	for	Bolotnitsa	!	''	Djabran	Fluctus	.
If	that	do	n't	flow	off	the	tongue	,	what	does	?
I	mean	kids	are	studying	this	stuff	and	they	've	got	the	word	``	fluctus	''	up	there	.	That	's	wrong	.
One	dyslexic	kid	and	he	could	be	ruining	his	life	.
``	It	fluctus	up	,	Mama	.	''
Hikuleo	Fluctus	.
That	's	a	little	more	flowing	.	Hikuleo	sounds	like	a	kind	of	a	Leonardo	DiCaprio	17	syllable	thing	.
And	that	's	the	Tonga	underworld	.
And	one	of	my	favorites	is	the	Itoki	Fluctus	,	who	is	the	Nicaraguan	goddess	of	insects	,	stars	,	and	planets	.
Now	,	if	you	're	a	goddess	of	stars	and	planets	would	n't	you	relegate	insects	to	somebody	else	?
``	No	,	no	,	really	,	I	'm	so	busy	with	the	stars	.
Would	you	mind	taking	the	insects	?	Thank	you	darling	.
Oh	take	the	spiders	too	.	I	know	they	're	not	insects	,	but	I	do	n't	care	.
Monkeys	,	chimps	,	just	get	rid	of	the	hairy	creatures	.	''	Now	,	we	're	going	to	be	going	to	Mars	one	day	.	And	when	we	do	,	it	's	going	to	be	unfair	for	the	people	that	are	living	there	to	have	to	live	with	these	ridiculous	names	.
So	,	you	'll	be	on	Mars	,	and	you	're	at	Hellespointica	Depressio	which	has	got	to	be	a	really	``	up	''	place	.
Yeah	,	I	'm	at	the	Depressio	,	and	I	want	to	get	over	to	Amazonis	so	I	plug	it	into	the	Mars	map	,	and	click	the	button	and	there	's	my	directions	.
I	go	to	Chrysokeras	.
Left	to	the	Thymiamata	.
Then	to	Niliacus	Lacus	,	which	is	not	a	bad	name	.
Niliacus	Lacus	,	try	to	get	the	practice	,	slick-a-tick-a-bacus	.
That	's	a	cool	name	.	I	will	say	that	.
So	,	I	hold	back	a	little	of	my	venom	for	these	astronomical	misnomers	.
And	then	of	course	Arnon	to	Thoth	.
And	of	course	there	will	be	advertisements	.
This	is	from	their	rule	book	,	the	International	Astronomical	Union	.
And	you	know	they	're	international	because	they	put	it	``	en	Francais	''	as	well	.
L'Union	Astronomique	Internationale	,	for	those	of	you	who	do	n't	speak	French	.
I	thought	I	'd	translate	for	you	.
From	the	rulebook	:	Nomenclature	is	a	tool	.
The	first	consideration	,	make	it	clear	,	simple	and	unambiguous	.
And	I	think	that	Djabran	Fluctus	,	that	fits	that	mode	.
That	's	simple	,	the	goddess	of	goats	,	very	simple	.
Djabran	Fluctus	.
``	Now	,	Frank	is	this	clear	to	you	,	Djabran	Fluctus	?	''
``	Yeah	,	that	's	the	goat	goddess	right	?	The	Abacazanian	?
It	's	clear	to	me	.	''
``	Listen	,	I	'm	going	back	to	the	swamp	mermaid	.	Can	you	call	me	in	a	little	while	?	''
Also	,	from	the	actual	document	I	highlighted	a	part	I	thought	may	be	of	interest	.
Anyone	can	suggest	changing	a	name	.
So	,	I	look	to	you	,	fellow	member	of	the	Earth	community	.
We	've	got	to	change	this	stuff	up	fast	.
So	,	these	are	actual	names	of	people	that	work	there	.
I	did	some	more	investigation	.
These	are	more	people	working	for	this	group	.
And	,	as	you	can	see	,	they	do	n't	use	their	first	names	.
These	are	people	naming	planets	,	and	they	wo	n't	use	their	first	names	.
Something	is	askew	here	.
Is	it	because	his	name	is	really	Jupiter	Blunck	?
Is	that	Ganymede	Andromeda	Burba	?
Is	that	Mars	Ya	Marov	?
I	do	n't	know	.	But	it	's	investigative	material	,	no	doubt	.
There	are	some	mapping	people	who	do	use	their	names	.
Witness	please	,	Eugene	Shoemaker	,	who	,	diligently	,	from	a	young	boy	decided	he	wanted	to	make	maps	of	celestial	bodies	.
Must	have	been	a	very	interesting	day	in	the	Shoemaker	house	.
``	Mom	,	I	want	to	make	maps	.	''
``	That	's	wonderful	Eugene	.	You	could	make	maps	of	Toronto	.	''
``	No	,	I	want	to	make	maps	of	planets	.	''
``	Yeah	,	go	to	your	room	.	''
Martians	,	Venusians	,	Jovians	.
We	have	names	for	places	where	people	do	n't	exist	.
That	seems	a	little	silly	to	me	.
There	are	no	Jovians	.
Getting	back	to	my	premise	,	I	used	stamps	,	by	the	way	,	because	you	do	n't	have	to	pay	anybody	for	the	rights	.
There	is	obviously	Einstein	,	Niels	Bohr	,	de	Fermat	's	last	theorem	,	and	I	'm	not	sure	whether	that	's	James	Coburn	or	Richard	Harris	.
It	's	definitely	one	of	the	two	.	I	'm	not	really	clear	which	one	.
But	obviously	the	point	is	that	numbers	are	maps	.
And	within	numbers	,	is	there	an	underlying	secret	to	the	universe	?
That	is	the	premise	of	this	particular	presentation	.
By	the	way	,	that	's	a	natural	picture	of	Saturn	,	no	adjustments	.	I	mean	that	's	just	beautiful	.
So	beautiful	that	I	will	even	give	up	a	laugh	to	explain	my	love	of	this	particular	planet	,	and	the	day	Saturday	,	named	after	it	,	wonderfully	.
So	,	formulas	relate	number	to	form	.
That	's	Euler	,	his	formula	was	one	of	the	inspirations	that	lead	to	the	beginning	of	string	theory	which	is	kind	of	cool	,	not	that	funny	,	but	it	is	cool	.
He	was	also	famous	for	having	no	body	.
Which	a	lot	of	you	are	like	,	``	How	did	he	figure	that	out	?	''
He	's	got	no	body	,	no	man	,	just	a	head	floating	high	.
Here	comes	Euler	.
And	that	's	an	icosahedron	,	which	is	one	of	the	five	sacred	solids	,	very	important	shapes	.
You	see	the	icosahedron	again	.
The	dodecahedron	,	it	's	dual	.
There	is	a	dodecahedron	which	I	had	to	do	in	my	room	last	night	.
The	five	sacred	solids	,	as	you	can	see	there	.
Which	is	not	to	be	confused	with	the	five	sacred	salads	.
Blue	cheese	,	ranch	,	oil	and	vinegar	,	thousand	islands	and	house	.
I	suggest	the	house	.
The	reality	,	now	here	is	something	important	.
What	's	important	about	this	is	these	shapes	are	duals	of	each	other	.
And	you	can	see	how	the	icosahedron	withdraws	into	the	dodecahedron	and	then	they	just	merge	into	each	other	.
So	,	the	whole	concept	of	branes	in	the	universe	,	if	the	universe	is	shaped	like	a	dodecahedron	this	is	a	very	good	map	of	what	could	possibly	be	.
And	that	is	,	of	course	,	what	we	are	here	to	talk	about	.
What	a	coincidence	!
October	9th	,	in	France	,	Jean-Pierre	Luminet	said	that	the	universe	is	probably	shaped	like	a	dodecahedron	,	based	on	information	that	they	got	from	this	probe	.
This	would	be	a	normal	wave	pattern	.
But	what	they	're	seeing	,	way	out	there	in	the	far	reaches	of	the	microwave	background	,	is	this	kind	of	odd	undulation	.
It	does	n't	plug	in	to	what	they	suspected	a	flat	universe	would	be	.
So	,	you	can	kind	of	get	an	idea	from	this	extrapolating	that	back	under	this	huge	picture	,	so	we	get	this	idea	of	what	the	primal	universe	looked	like	.
And	judging	from	this	,	it	looks	a	little	like	a	cheeseburger	.
So	,	I	'm	thinking	the	universe	is	either	a	dodecahedron	or	a	cheeseburger	.
And	for	me	,	that	's	a	win-win	.
Everybody	goes	,	I	'm	happy	.
Better	really	hurry	up	.
I	just	threw	this	in	because	as	important	as	all	of	our	intellectual	abilities	are	,	without	heart	and	without	love	it	's	just	--	it	's	all	meaningless	.	And	that	,	to	me	,	is	really	beautiful	.
Except	for	that	creepy	guy	in	the	background	.
Getting	back	to	the	point	of	my	particular	presentation	,	Kepler	,	one	of	my	great	heroes	,	who	realized	that	these	five	solids	,	which	I	spoke	of	earlier	,	were	related	somehow	to	the	planets	,	but	he	could	n't	prove	it	.	It	freaked	him	out	.
But	it	did	lead	to	Newton	discovering	gravity	.
So	,	maps	of	things	leading	to	organized	understandings	of	the	universe	in	which	we	emerge	.	Now	this	is	Isaac	from	a	Vietnamese	stamp	.
I	am	not	suggesting	at	all	that	my	Vietnamese	brothers	and	sisters	could	maybe	use	a	little	art	class	here	and	there	.	But	...
that	's	not	a	good	picture	.
Not	a	good	picture	.	Now	,	my	friends	in	the	island	of	Nevis	are	a	little	better	.	Look	at	that	!	That	's	Isaac	Newton	.
That	guy	is	rockin	'	.
What	a	handsome	cat	.
Once	again	,	Nicaragua	let	me	down	.
And	Copernicus	looks	like	Johnny	Carson	,	which	is	really	weird	.
I	do	n't	get	that	at	all	.
Once	again	,	these	guys	rock	it	out	.
Isaac	is	kickin	'	ass	.	Man	,	he	looks	like	a	rock	star	.
This	is	freaky	is	a	major	way	.
This	is	Sierra	Leone	.
They	got	little	babies	in	there	,	floating	in	there	.
Man	.	I	do	n't	really	need	to	comment	on	this	.	But	I	did	n't	know	that	Isaac	Newton	was	in	the	Moody	Blues	.	Did	you	?
When	did	this	happen	?
It	's	a	different	kind	of	course	.	And	they	've	got	five	apples	?
I	mean	these	guys	are	extrapolating	in	realms	that	are	not	necessarily	valid	.
Although	five	is	a	good	number	,	of	course	.
Ecuador	,	my	friend	Kepler	,	as	you	can	see	,	they	call	him	Juan	.
Juan	?	No	!	Johannes	,	not	Juan	.
It	was	n't	Carlos	Chaplain	.	It	's	wrong	.
René	Descartes	,	of	course	.	Once	again	these	Grenada	people	,	this	is	like	way	too	sick	for	anybody	's	imagination	.
He	's	all	murky	.	There	is	little	kids	leaning	on	his	leg	,	little	ghosts	flying	around	.	We	got	ta	clean	this	stuff	up	fast	,	ladies	and	gentlemen	.
This	is	,	of	course	,	the	Cartesian	coordinates	.
Once	again	,	that	's	Sierra	Leone	.
This	is	again	,	indicating	how	numbers	relate	to	space	relate	to	form	,	maps	of	the	universe	.
Because	that	's	why	we	're	here	,	really	,	I	think	to	figure	stuff	out	and	to	love	each	other	.
Descartes	.
Before	the	horse	.
Now	,	Monaco	took	Descartes	,	and	just	flipped	him	around	.
Now	,	Monaco	is	problematic	for	me	,	and	I	'll	show	you	why	.
Here	is	a	map	.	All	they	have	is	a	casino	on	it	.
And	why	Franklin	Delano	Roosevelt	is	on	their	map	I	do	n't	even	want	to	hazard	a	guess	.
But	I	'd	say	he	'd	been	to	Hellespointica	Depressio	recently	.
This	is	the	flag	of	Monaco	.	Ladies	and	gentlemen	,	the	flag	of	Indonesia	.	Please	examine	.
Not	sure	how	this	came	to	be	,	but	it	's	not	right	.
In	Monaco	,	``	No	,	what	are	you	talking	about	?
They	are	so	different	.
Look	,	ours	is	more	red	,	it	's	longer	.
They	stole	our	flag	!	They	stole	our	flag	!	''	Bode	's	law	was	n't	even	his	law	.	It	was	a	guy	named	Titus	.
And	the	reason	I	just	bring	this	up	because	it	is	a	law	that	does	n't	really	work	.
That	's	Jude	Law	and	some	of	his	films	recently	did	n't	work	.
Just	a	correlation	that	indicates	how	things	are	misinterpreted	.
And	I	wonder	if	the	photographer	said	,	``	Okay	,	Jude	,	could	you	touch	your	tooth	?	That	's	good	.	''	Just	a	tip	,	if	you	're	being	photographed	for	press	pictures	,	do	n't	touch	your	teeth	.
Prime	numbers	,	Gauss	,	one	of	my	favorites	.
Golden	section	,	I	've	been	obsessed	with	this	thing	since	before	I	was	born	.
I	know	that	scares	a	lot	of	you	,	but	that	was	my	purpose	entirely	.
There	we	can	see	Fibonacci	numbers	related	to	the	Golden	Section	,	because	Fibonacci	and	Golden	Section	relate	to	the	unfolding	of	the	measured	meter	of	matter	,	as	I	refer	to	it	.
If	Fibonacci	had	been	on	Paxil	,	that	would	be	the	Fibonacci	series	.
``	Ten	milligram	,	20	milligram	.	''
``	Leonardo	,	dinner	's	ready	,	put	down	those	books	and	take	your	pills	.	''
``	Yes	,	Mama	.	''
Alright	where	is	this	going	?	That	's	a	good	question	.
Here	is	the	premise	that	I	began	27	years	ago	.
If	numbers	can	express	the	laws	of	this	incredible	universe	that	we	live	,	I	reason	,	through	some	sort	of	reverse	engineering	,	we	could	extrapolate	from	them	some	basic	structural	element	of	this	universe	.
And	that	's	what	I	did	.	Twenty-seven	years	ago	I	started	working	on	this	.
And	I	tried	to	build	a	particle	accelerator	.
And	that	did	n't	work	out	well	.
So	,	then	I	thought	a	calculator	is	a	metaphor	.
I	can	just	divide	numbers	,	that	's	like	atom	smashing	.
That	's	what	I	did	.	That	's	how	I	found	Moleeds	.
Moleeds	are	what	I	believe	the	thing	that	will	allow	string	theory	to	be	proved	.
They	are	the	nodes	on	the	string	,	patterns	and	relationships	,	27	,	37	.
That	was	the	first	chart	I	came	up	with	.
You	can	see	,	even	if	you	do	n't	go	for	the	numbers	,	the	beauty	of	the	symmetry	.
The	numbers	from	one	to	36	,	divided	into	six	groups	.
Symmetry	,	pairs	.
Every	top	adds	up	to	37	.
Bottom	,	all	74	.
There	is	so	many	intricate	relationships	that	I	'm	not	going	to	go	there	now	,	because	you	would	say	,	``	Hey	,	go	back	to	the	Fluctus	part	.	''
Circle	of	Fifths	,	acoustic	harmony	,	geometric	symmetry	.
I	knew	those	two	were	related	.
Once	again	,	the	Cartesian	kind	of	cross-over	.
So	,	I	said	if	I	'm	going	to	put	a	circle	,	see	what	kind	of	patterns	I	get	,	boom	,	the	Red	System	.
Look	at	that	.	You	ca	n't	just	make	this	stuff	up	,	ladies	and	gentlemen	.
You	ca	n't	just	go	around	going	,	``	Oh	,	I	'm	going	to	put	some	triangles	in	a	circle	and	they	're	going	to	be	symmetrical	.	And	they	're	all	going	to	add	up	,	and	it	's	going	to	be	,	oh	yeah	,	I	figured	that	out	.	''
This	is	beyond	anything	anybody	could	just	make	up	.
There	is	the	Orange	System	.
And	you	'll	see	over	here	,	these	are	multiples	of	the	number	27	.
And	they	recapitulate	that	shape	,	even	though	that	's	a	circle	of	nine	and	that	's	a	circle	of	36	.	It	's	nuts	.
That	's	the	Green	System	.	It	all	folds	in	half	on	the	Green	System	,	right	between	18	and	19	.
The	Blue	System	.	The	Violet	.	It	's	all	there	.
Look	at	that	!	I	mean	you	can	not	make	that	stuff	up	.
That	just	does	n't	fall	out	of	a	tree	,	ladies	and	gentlemen	.
Twenty-seven	years	of	my	life	!
And	I	'm	presenting	it	here	at	TED	.	Why	?
Because	this	is	the	place	if	aliens	land	,	I	hope	they	come	here	.
``	We	are	going	to	destroy	the	Earth	.	Hmmm	...	maybe	not	.	''
In	this	last	year	I	have	found	these	subsequent	systems	which	allow	for	the	mathematic	possibilities	of	the	Calabi-Yau	manifolds	in	a	way	that	does	n't	necessitate	these	little	hidden	dimensions	.
Which	works	mathematically	,	but	it	just	does	n't	seem	God-like	to	me	.
It	just	seems	like	it	's	not	sexy	and	elegant	,	it	's	hidden	.
I	do	n't	want	hidden	,	I	want	to	see	it	.
I	found	other	pairs	all	have	symmetry	,	even	though	,	unlike	the	master	one	,	their	symmetry	is	split	.
Unbelievable	.	This	is	like	crazy	.
Am	I	the	only	one	that	sees	this	?
You	know	,	I	did	n't	just	draw	this	in	a	day	,	by	the	way	.
You	know	,	try	making	some	charts	like	this	at	home	.
You	got	ta	be	accurate	!	There	's	measurement	involved	,	increments	.
These	are	maps	,	by	the	way	.
Not	stamps	,	but	one	day	.
Okay	,	I	'm	getting	to	the	punch	.	Golden	Ratio	,	it	's	crazy	.
And	look	at	this	,	built	within	it	is	the	Golden	Ratio	.
I	start	looking	at	that	,	and	look	at	them	again	.
They	start	looking	like	planets	.
I	go	to	JPL	.
I	look	at	the	orbits	of	the	planets	.
I	find	18	examples	of	it	in	our	solar	system	.
I	never	told	anybody	.	This	is	the	first	thing	.	This	could	be	history	.
Kepler	was	right	.
Eighteen	and	19	,	the	middle	of	the	Moleeds	,	0.618	is	the	golden	section	.	Multiply	them	together	,	18.618	x	19.618	is	365.247	.
Which	is	.005	different	from	the	number	of	days	in	a	year	.
Hey	,	you	ca	n't	make	this	up	.
Thank	you	very	much	.
Thank	you	.
Thank	you	.
Good	afternoon	.
If	you	have	followed	diplomatic	news	in	the	past	weeks	,	you	may	have	heard	of	a	kind	of	crisis	between	China	and	the	U.S.	regarding	cyberattacks	against	the	American	company	Google	.
Many	things	have	been	said	about	this	.	Some	people	have	called	a	cyberwar	what	may	actually	be	just	a	spy	operation	--	and	obviously	,	a	quite	mishandled	one	.
However	,	this	episode	reveals	the	growing	anxiety	in	the	Western	world	regarding	these	emerging	cyber	weapons	.
It	so	happens	that	these	weapons	are	dangerous	.	They	're	of	a	new	nature	:	they	could	lead	the	world	into	a	digital	conflict	that	could	turn	into	an	armed	struggle	.
These	virtual	weapons	can	also	destroy	the	physical	world	.
In	1982	,	in	the	middle	of	the	Cold	War	in	Soviet	Siberia	,	a	pipeline	exploded	with	a	burst	of	3	kilotons	,	the	equivalent	of	a	fourth	of	the	Hiroshima	bomb	.
Now	we	know	today	--	this	was	revealed	by	Thomas	Reed	,	Ronald	Reagan	's	former	U.S.	Air	Force	Secretary	--	this	explosion	was	actually	the	result	of	a	CIA	sabotage	operation	,	in	which	they	had	managed	to	infiltrate	the	IT	management	systems	of	that	pipeline	.
More	recently	,	the	U.S.	government	revealed	that	in	September	2008	,	more	than	3	million	people	in	the	state	of	Espirito	Santo	in	Brazil	were	plunged	into	darkness	,	victims	of	a	blackmail	operation	from	cyber	pirates	.
Even	more	worrying	for	the	Americans	,	in	December	2008	the	holiest	of	holies	,	the	IT	systems	of	CENTCOM	,	the	central	command	managing	the	wars	in	Iraq	and	Afghanistan	,	may	have	been	infiltrated	by	hackers	who	used	these	:	plain	but	infected	USB	keys	.	And	with	these	keys	,	they	may	have	been	able	to	get	inside	CENTCOM	's	systems	,	to	see	and	hear	everything	,	and	maybe	even	infect	some	of	them	.
As	a	result	,	the	Americans	take	the	threat	very	seriously	.	I	'll	quote	General	James	Cartwright	,	Vice	Chairman	of	the	Joint	Chiefs	of	Staff	,	who	says	in	a	report	to	Congress	that	cyberattacks	could	be	as	powerful	as	weapons	of	mass	destruction	.
Moreover	,	the	Americans	have	decided	to	spend	over	30	billion	dollars	in	the	next	five	years	to	build	up	their	cyberwar	capabilities	.
And	across	the	world	today	,	we	see	a	sort	of	cyber	arms	race	,	with	cyberwar	units	built	up	by	countries	like	North	Korea	or	even	Iran	.
Yet	,	what	you	'll	never	hear	from	spokespeople	from	the	Pentagon	or	the	French	Department	of	Defence	is	that	the	question	is	n't	really	who	's	the	enemy	,	but	actually	the	very	nature	of	cyber	weapons	.
And	to	understand	why	,	we	must	look	at	how	,	through	the	ages	,	military	technologies	have	maintained	or	destroyed	world	peace	.
For	example	,	if	we	'd	had	TEDxParis	350	years	ago	,	we	would	have	talked	about	the	military	innovation	of	the	day	--	the	massive	Vauban-style	fortifications	--	and	we	could	have	predicted	a	period	of	stability	in	the	world	or	in	Europe	.	which	was	indeed	the	case	in	Europe	between	1650	and	1750	.
Similarly	,	if	we	'd	had	this	talk	30	or	40	years	ago	,	we	would	have	seen	how	the	rise	of	nuclear	weapons	,	and	the	threat	of	mutually	assured	destruction	they	imply	,	prevents	a	direct	fight	between	the	two	superpowers	.
However	,	if	we	'd	had	this	talk	60	years	ago	,	we	would	have	seen	how	the	emergence	of	new	aircraft	and	tank	technologies	,	which	give	the	advantage	to	the	attacker	,	make	the	Blitzkrieg	doctrine	very	credible	and	thus	create	the	possibility	of	war	in	Europe	.
So	military	technologies	can	influence	the	course	of	the	world	,	can	make	or	break	world	peace	--	and	there	lies	the	issue	with	cyber	weapons	.
The	first	issue	:	Imagine	a	potential	enemy	announcing	they	're	building	a	cyberwar	unit	,	but	only	for	their	country	's	defense	.
Okay	,	but	what	distinguishes	it	from	an	offensive	unit	?
It	gets	even	more	complicated	when	the	doctrines	of	use	become	ambiguous	.
Just	3	years	ago	,	both	the	U.S.	and	France	were	saying	they	were	investing	militarily	in	cyberspace	,	strictly	to	defend	their	IT	systems	.
But	today	both	countries	say	the	best	defense	is	to	attack	.
And	so	,	they	're	joining	China	,	whose	doctrine	of	use	for	15	years	has	been	both	defensive	and	offensive	.
The	second	issue	:	Your	country	could	be	under	cyberattack	with	entire	regions	plunged	into	total	darkness	,	and	you	may	not	even	know	who	's	attacking	you	.
Cyber	weapons	have	this	peculiar	feature	:	they	can	be	used	without	leaving	traces	.
This	gives	a	tremendous	advantage	to	the	attacker	,
because	the	defender	does	n't	know	who	to	fight	back	against	.
And	if	the	defender	retaliates	against	the	wrong	adversary	,	they	risk	making	one	more	enemy	and	ending	up	diplomatically	isolated	.
This	issue	is	n't	just	theoretical	.
In	May	2007	,	Estonia	was	the	victim	of	cyberattacks	,	that	damaged	its	communication	and	banking	systems	.
Estonia	accused	Russia	.
But	NATO	,	though	it	defends	Estonia	,	reacted	very	prudently	.	Why	?
Because	NATO	could	n't	be	100	%	sure	that	the	Kremlin	was	indeed	behind	these	attacks	.
So	to	sum	up	,	on	the	one	hand	,	when	a	possible	enemy	announces	they	're	building	a	cyberwar	unit	,	you	do	n't	know	whether	it	's	for	attack	or	defense	.	On	the	other	hand	,	we	know	that	these	weapons	give	an	advantage	to	attacking	.
In	a	major	article	published	in	1978	,	Professor	Robert	Jervis	of	Columbia	University	in	New	York	described	a	model	to	understand	how	conflicts	could	arise	.
In	this	context	,	when	you	do	n't	know	if	the	potential	enemy	is	preparing	for	defense	or	attack	,	and	if	the	weapons	give	an	advantage	to	attacking	,	then	this	environment	is	most	likely	to	spark	a	conflict	.
This	is	the	environment	that	's	being	created	by	cyber	weapons	today	,	and	historically	it	was	the	environment	in	Europe	at	the	onset	of	World	War	I	.
So	cyber	weapons	are	dangerous	by	nature	,	but	in	addition	,	they	're	emerging	in	a	much	more	unstable	environment	.
If	you	remember	the	Cold	War	,	it	was	a	very	hard	game	,	but	a	stable	one	played	only	by	two	players	,	which	allowed	for	some	coordination	between	the	two	superpowers	.
Today	we	're	moving	to	a	multipolar	world	in	which	coordination	is	much	more	complicated	,	as	we	have	seen	at	Copenhagen	.	And	this	coordination	may	become	even	trickier	with	the	introduction	of	cyber	weapons	.
Why	?	Because	no	nation	knows	for	sure	whether	its	neighbor	is	about	to	attack	.
So	nations	may	live	under	the	threat	of	what	Nobel	Prize	winner	Thomas	Schelling	called	the	``	reciprocal	fear	of	surprise	attack	,	''	as	I	do	n't	know	if	my	neighbor	is	about	to	attack	me	or	not	--	I	may	never	know	--	so	I	might	take	the	upper	hand	and	attack	first	.
Just	last	week	,	in	a	New	York	Times	article	dated	January	26	,	2010	,	it	was	revealed	for	the	first	time	that	officials	at	the	National	Security	Agency	were	considering	the	possibility	of	preemptive	attacks	in	cases	where	the	U.S.	was	about	to	be	cyberattacked	.
And	these	preemptive	attacks	might	not	just	remain	in	cyberspace	.
In	May	2009	,	General	Kevin	Chilton	,	commander	of	the	U.S.	nuclear	forces	,	stated	that	in	the	event	of	cyberattacks	against	the	U.S.	,	all	options	would	be	on	the	table	.
Cyber	weapons	do	not	replace	conventional	or	nuclear	weapons	--
they	just	add	a	new	layer	to	the	existing	system	of	terror	.
But	in	doing	so	,	they	also	add	their	own	risk	of	triggering	a	conflict	--	as	we	've	just	seen	,	a	very	important	risk	--	and	a	risk	we	may	have	to	confront	with	a	collective	security	solution	which	includes	all	of	us	:	European	allies	,	NATO	members	,	our	American	friends	and	allies	,	our	other	Western	allies	,	and	maybe	,	by	forcing	their	hand	a	little	,	our	Russian	and	Chinese	partners	.
The	information	technologies	Joël	de	Rosnay	was	talking	about	,	which	were	historically	born	from	military	research	,	are	today	on	the	verge	of	developing	an	offensive	capability	of	destruction	,	which	could	tomorrow	,	if	we	're	not	careful	,	completely	destroy	world	peace	.
Cartoons	are	basically	short	stories	.
I	tried	to	find	one	that	did	n't	have	a	whole	lot	of	words	.
Not	all	of	them	have	happy	endings	.
So	how	did	I	get	started	cartooning	?
I	doodled	a	lot	as	a	kid	,	and	if	you	spend	enough	time	doodling	,	sooner	or	later	,	something	happens	:	all	your	career	options	run	out	.
So	you	have	to	make	a	living	cartooning	.
Actually	,	I	fell	in	love	with	the	ocean	when	I	was	a	little	boy	,	when	I	was	about	eight	or	nine	.
This	is	some	of	my	early	work	.
Eventually	,	my	mom	took	the	red	crayon	away	,	so	it	was	[	unclear	]	.
But	I	'd	like	to	relay	to	you	a	childhood	experience	of	mine	that	really	made	me	see	the	ocean	differently	,	and	it	's	become	the	foundation	of	my	work	because	,	I	feel	like	,	if	in	a	day	,	I	can	see	the	ocean	differently	,	then	I	can	evoke	that	same	kind	of	change	in	others	,	especially	kids	.
Before	that	day	,	this	is	how	I	saw	the	ocean	.
It	's	just	a	big	blue	surface	.
And	this	is	how	we	've	seen	the	ocean	since	the	beginning	of	time	.
It	's	a	mystery	.
There	's	been	a	lot	of	folklore	developed	around	the	ocean	,	mostly	negative	.
And	that	prompted	people	to	make	maps	like	this	,	with	all	kinds	of	wonderful	detail	on	the	land	,	but	when	you	get	to	the	waters	edge	,	the	ocean	looks	like	one	giant	puddle	of	blue	paint	.
And	this	is	the	way	I	saw	the	ocean	at	school	--	as	if	to	say	,	``	All	geography	and	science	lessons	stop	at	water	's	edge	.
This	part	's	not	going	to	be	on	the	test	.	''	But	that	day	I	flew	low	over	the	islands	--	it	was	a	family	trip	to	the	Caribbean	,	and	I	flew	in	a	small	plane	low	over	the	islands	.
This	is	what	I	saw	.	I	saw	hills	and	valleys	.
I	saw	forests	and	meadows	.
I	saw	grottoes	and	secret	gardens	and	places	I	'd	love	to	hide	as	a	kid	,	if	I	could	only	breathe	underwater	.
And	best	of	all	,	I	saw	the	animals	.
I	saw	a	manta	ray	that	looked	as	big	as	the	plane	I	was	flying	in	.
And	I	flew	over	a	lagoon	with	a	shark	in	it	,	and	that	was	the	day	that	my	comic	strip	about	a	shark	was	born	.
So	from	that	day	on	,	I	was	an	ordinary	kid	walking	around	on	dry	land	,	but	my	head	was	down	there	,	underwater	.
Up	until	that	day	,	these	were	the	animals	that	were	most	common	in	my	life	.
These	were	the	ones	I	'd	like	to	draw	--	all	variations	of	four	legs	and	fur	.
But	when	you	got	to	the	ocean	,	my	imagination	was	no	competition	for	nature	.
Every	time	I	'd	come	up	with	a	crazy	cartoon	character	on	the	drawing	board	,	I	'd	find	a	critter	in	the	ocean	that	was	even	crazier	.
And	the	differences	in	scale	between	this	tiny	sea	dragon	and	this	enormous	humpback	whale	was	like	something	out	of	a	science-fiction	movie	.
Whenever	I	talk	to	kids	,	I	always	like	to	tell	them	,	the	biggest	animal	that	ever	lived	is	still	alive	.
It	's	not	a	dinosaur	;	it	's	a	whale	,	animals	as	big	as	office	buildings	still	swimming	around	out	there	in	our	ocean	.
Speaking	of	dinosaurs	,	sharks	are	basically	the	same	fish	they	were	300	million	years	ago	.
So	if	you	ever	fantasize	about	going	back	in	time	and	seeing	what	a	dinosaur	looked	like	,	that	's	what	a	dinosaur	looks	like	.
So	you	have	living	dinosaurs	and	space	aliens	,	animals	that	evolved	in	zero	gravity	in	harsh	conditions	.
It	's	just	incredible	;	no	Hollywood	designer	could	come	up	with	something	more	interesting	than	that	.
Or	this	fangtooth	.	The	particles	in	the	water	make	it	look	like	it	's	floating	in	outer	space	.
Could	you	image	if	we	looked	through	the	Hubble	Telescope	and	we	saw	that	?
It	would	start	a	whole	new	space	race	.
But	instead	,	we	stick	a	camera	in	the	deep	ocean	,	and	we	see	a	fish	,	and	it	does	n't	capture	our	imagination	as	a	society	.
We	say	to	ourselves	,	``	Maybe	we	can	make	fish	sticks	with	it	or	something	.	''
So	,	what	I	'd	like	to	do	now	is	try	a	little	drawing	.
So	,	I	'm	going	to	try	to	draw	this	fangtooth	here	.
I	love	to	draw	the	deep	sea	fish	,	because	they	are	so	ugly	,	but	beautiful	in	their	own	way	.
Maybe	we	can	give	him	a	little	bioluminescence	here	--	give	him	a	headlight	,	maybe	a	brake	light	,	turn	signals	.
But	it	's	easy	to	see	why	these	animals	make	such	great	cartoon	characters	,	their	shapes	and	sizes	.
So	some	of	them	actually	seem	to	have	powers	like	superheroes	in	a	comic	book	.
For	instance	,	take	these	sea	turtles	.
They	kind	of	have	a	sixth	sense	like	Superman	's	x-ray	vision	.
They	can	sense	the	magnetic	fields	of	the	earth	.
And	they	can	use	that	sense	to	navigate	hundreds	of	miles	of	open	ocean	.
I	kind	of	give	my	turtle	hands	just	to	make	them	an	easier	cartoon	character	to	work	with	.
Or	take	this	sea	cucumber	.
It	's	not	an	animal	we	draw	cartoons	of	or	draw	at	all	.
He	's	like	an	underwater	Spiderman	.
He	shoots	out	these	sticky	webs	to	entangle	his	enemy	.
Of	course	,	sea	cucumbers	shoot	them	out	their	rears	,	which	,	in	my	opinion	,	makes	them	much	more	interesting	a	superhero	.
He	ca	n't	spin	a	web	anytime	;	he	's	got	to	pull	his	pants	down	first	.
Or	the	blowfish	.
The	blowfish	is	like	the	Incredible	Hulk	.
It	can	change	its	body	into	a	big	,	intimidating	fish	in	a	matter	of	seconds	.
I	'm	going	to	draw	this	blowfish	uninflated	.
And	then	I	'm	going	to	attempt	onscreen	animation	here	.
Let	's	see	.
Try	and	inflate	it	.
``	You	talkin	'	to	me	?	''	See	,	he	can	inflate	himself	when	he	wants	to	be	intimidating	.
Or	take	this	swordfish	.
Could	you	imagine	being	born	with	a	tool	for	a	nose	?
Do	you	think	he	wakes	up	in	the	morning	,	looks	in	the	mirror	and	says	,	``	Somebody	's	getting	stabbed	today	.	''
Or	this	lionfish	for	instance	.
Imagine	trying	to	make	friends	covered	with	razor-sharp	poisonous	barbs	.
It	's	not	something	you	want	to	put	on	your	Facebook	page	,	right	?
My	characters	are	--	my	lead	character	's	a	shark	named	Sherman	.
He	's	a	great	white	shark	.
And	I	kind	of	broke	the	mold	with	Sherman	.
I	did	n't	want	to	go	with	this	ruthless	predator	image	.
He	's	kind	of	just	out	there	making	a	living	.
He	's	sort	of	a	Homer	Simpson	with	fins	.
And	then	his	sidekick	is	a	sea	turtle	,	as	I	mentioned	before	,	named	Filmore	.
He	uses	his	wonderful	skills	at	navigation	to	wander	the	oceans	,	looking	for	a	mate	.
And	he	does	manage	to	find	them	,	but	great	navigation	skills	,	lousy	pick-up	lines	.
He	never	seems	to	settle	on	any	particular	girl	.
I	have	a	hermit	crab	named	Hawthorne	,	who	does	n't	get	a	lot	of	respect	as	a	hermit	crab	,	so	he	kind	of	wishes	he	were	a	great	white	shark	.
And	then	I	'll	introduce	you	to	one	more	character	,	this	guy	,	Ernest	,	who	is	basically	a	juvenile	delinquent	in	a	fish	body	.
So	with	characters	,	you	can	make	stories	.
Sometimes	making	a	story	is	as	easy	as	putting	two	characters	in	a	room	and	seeing	what	happens	.
So	,	imagine	a	great	white	shark	and	a	giant	squid	in	the	same	bathroom	.
Or	,	sometimes	I	take	them	to	places	that	people	have	never	heard	of	because	they	're	underwater	.
For	instance	,	I	took	them	skiing	in	the	Mid-Atlantic	Range	,	which	is	this	range	of	mountains	in	the	middle	of	the	Atlantic	.
I	've	taken	them	to	the	Sea	of	Japan	,	where	they	met	giant	jellyfish	.
I	've	taken	them	camping	in	the	kelp	forests	of	California	.
This	next	one	here	,	I	did	a	story	on	the	census	of	marine	life	.
And	that	was	a	lot	of	fun	because	,	as	most	of	you	know	,	it	's	a	real	project	we	've	heard	about	.
But	it	was	a	chance	for	me	to	introduce	readers	to	a	lot	of	crazy	undersea	characters	.
So	we	start	off	the	story	with	Ernest	,	who	volunteers	as	a	census	taker	.
He	goes	down	and	he	meets	this	famous	anglerfish	.
Then	he	meets	the	yeti	crab	,	the	famous	vampire	squid	--	elusive	,	hard	to	find	--	and	the	Dumbo	octopus	,	which	looks	so	much	like	a	cartoon	in	real	life	that	really	did	n't	have	to	change	a	thing	when	I	drew	it	.
I	did	another	story	on	marine	debris	.
I	was	speaking	to	a	lot	of	my	friends	in	the	conservation	business	,	and	they	--	I	asked	them	,	``	So	what	's	one	issue	you	would	like	everyone	to	know	more	about	?	''
And	they	said	--	this	one	friend	of	mine	said	,	``	I	've	got	one	word	for	you	:	plastic	.	''
And	I	told	him	,	``	Well	,	I	need	something	a	little	sexier	than	that	.
Plastic	just	is	not	going	to	do	it	.	''
We	sort	of	worked	things	out	.
He	wanted	me	to	use	words	like	polyvinyl	chloride	,	which	does	n't	really	work	in	voice	balloons	very	well	.
I	could	n't	fit	them	in	.
So	what	I	did	was	I	made	an	adventure	strip	.
Basically	,	this	bottle	travels	a	long	way	.
What	I	'm	trying	to	tell	readers	is	that	plastic	does	n't	really	go	away	;	it	just	continues	to	wash	downstream	.	And	a	lot	of	it	ends	up	washing	into	the	ocean	,	which	is	a	great	story	if	you	attach	a	couple	characters	to	it	,	especially	if	they	ca	n't	stand	each	other	,	like	these	two	.
So	,	I	sent	them	to	Boise	,	Idaho	,	where	they	dropped	a	plastic	bottle	into	the	Boise	sewer	system	.
And	it	ended	up	in	the	Boise	River	and	then	on	to	the	Columbia	River	and	then	to	the	mouth	of	the	Columbia	and	to	the	Pacific	Ocean	and	then	on	to	this	place	called	the	Great	Pacific	Garbage	Patch	--	which	is	this	giant	Pacific	gyre	in	the	North	Pacific	,	where	a	lot	of	this	plastic	ends	up	floating	around	--	and	then	back	onto	the	lagoon	.
So	that	was	basically	a	buddy	story	with	a	plastic	bottle	following	along	.
So	a	lot	of	people	remember	the	plastic	bottle	anyway	,	but	we	really	talked	about	marine	debris	and	plastic	in	the	course	of	that	one	.
The	third	storyline	I	did	about	a	year	and	a	half	ago	was	probably	my	most	difficult	.
It	was	on	shark	finning	,	and	I	felt	really	strongly	about	this	issue	.	And	I	felt	like	,	since	my	main	character	was	a	shark	,	the	comic	strip	was	a	perfect	vehicle	for	telling	the	public	about	this	.
Now	,	finning	is	the	act	of	taking	a	shark	,	cutting	the	valuable	fins	off	and	throwing	the	live	animal	back	in	the	water	.
It	's	cruel	,	it	's	wasteful	.
There	's	nothing	funny	or	entertaining	about	it	,	but	I	really	wanted	to	take	this	issue	on	.
I	had	to	kill	my	main	character	,	who	is	a	shark	.
We	start	with	Sherman	in	a	Chinese	restaurant	,	who	gets	a	fortune	that	he	's	about	to	get	caught	by	a	trawler	,	which	he	does	.
And	then	he	dies	.
He	gets	finned	,	and	then	he	gets	thrown	overboard	.
Ostensibly	,	he	's	dead	now	.
And	so	I	killed	a	character	that	's	been	in	the	newspaper	for	15	years	.
So	I	got	a	lot	of	reader	feedback	on	that	one	.
Meanwhile	,	the	other	characters	are	talking	about	shark	fin	soup	.
I	do	three	or	four	strips	after	that	where	we	explore	the	finning	issue	and	the	shark	fin	soup	issue	.
Sherman	's	up	in	shark	heaven	.
This	is	what	I	love	about	comic	strips	,	you	know	.
You	really	do	n't	have	to	worry	about	the	audience	suspending	its	sense	of	disbelief	because	,	if	you	start	with	a	talking	shark	,	readers	pretty	much	check	their	disbelief	at	the	door	.
You	can	kind	of	do	anything	.
It	becomes	a	near-death	experience	for	Sherman	.
Meanwhile	,	Ernest	finds	his	fins	on	the	internet	.
There	was	a	real	website	based	in	China	that	actually	sold	shark	fins	,	so	I	kind	of	exposed	that	.
And	he	clicks	the	``	buy	now	''	button	.
And	voila	,	next-day	air	,	they	show	up	,	and	they	surgically	reattach	them	.
I	ended	that	series	with	a	kind	of	a	mail-in	petition	that	encouraged	our	National	Marine	Fishery	Service	,	to	force	other	countries	to	have	a	stronger	stance	with	shark	management	.
Thanks	.
I	'd	like	to	end	with	a	little	metaphor	here	.
I	've	been	trying	to	think	of	a	metaphor	to	represent	Mission	Blue	,	and	this	is	what	I	came	up	with	.
Imagine	you	're	in	an	enormous	room	,	and	it	's	as	dark	as	a	cave	.
And	you	can	have	anything	in	that	room	,	anything	you	want	,	but	you	ca	n't	see	anything	.
You	've	been	given	one	tool	,	a	hammer	.
So	you	wander	around	in	the	darkness	,	and	you	bump	into	something	,	and	it	feels	like	it	's	made	of	stone	.
It	's	big	,	it	's	heavy	.	You	ca	n't	carry	it	away	,	so	you	bang	it	with	your	hammer	,	and	you	break	off	a	piece	.
And	you	take	the	piece	out	into	the	daylight	.
And	you	see	you	have	a	beautiful	piece	of	white	alabaster	.
So	you	say	to	yourself	,	``	Well	,	that	's	worth	something	.	''
So	you	go	back	into	the	room	,	and	you	break	this	thing	to	pieces	,	and	you	haul	it	away	.
And	you	find	other	things	,	and	you	break	that	up	,	and	you	haul	those	away	.
And	you	're	getting	all	kinds	of	cool	stuff	.
And	you	hear	other	people	doing	the	same	thing	.
So	you	get	this	sense	of	urgency	,	like	you	need	to	find	as	much	stuff	as	possible	as	soon	as	possible	.
And	then	some	yells	,	``	Stop	!	''
And	they	turn	up	the	lights	.
And	you	realize	where	you	are	;	you	're	in	the	Louvre	.
And	you	've	taken	all	this	complexity	and	beauty	,	and	you	've	turned	it	into	a	cheap	commodity	.
And	that	's	what	we	're	doing	with	the	ocean	.
And	part	of	what	Mission	Blue	is	about	is	yelling	,	``	Stop	!	''
so	that	each	of	us	--	explorer	,	scientist	,	cartoonist	,	singer	,	chef	--	can	turn	up	the	lights	in	their	own	way	.
And	that	's	what	I	hope	my	comic	strip	does	in	a	small	way	.
That	's	why	I	like	what	I	do	.
Thanks	for	listening	.
Well	,	good	morning	ladies	and	gentlemen	.
My	name	is	Art	Benjamin	,	and	I	am	a	``	mathemagician	.	''
What	that	means	is	,	I	combine	my	loves	of	math	and	magic	to	do	something	I	call	``	mathemagics	.	''
But	before	I	get	started	,	I	have	a	quick	question	for	the	audience	.
By	any	chance	,	did	anyone	happen	to	bring	with	them	this	morning	a	calculator	?
Seriously	,	if	you	have	a	calculator	with	you	,	raise	your	hand	,	raise	your	hand	.
I	--	was	--	your	hand	go	up	?
Now	bring	it	out	,	bring	it	out	.	Anybody	else	?
I	see	,	I	see	one	way	in	the	back	.
You	sir	,	that	's	three	,
And	anybody	on	this	side	here	?
OK	,	you	over	there	on	the	aisle	.	Would	the	four	of	you	with	calculators	please	bring	out	your	calculators	,	then	join	me	up	on	stage	.
And	let	's	give	these	volunteers	a	nice	round	of	applause	.
That	's	right	.	Now	,	since	I	have	n't	had	the	chance	to	work	with	these	calculators	,	I	need	to	make	sure	that	they	are	all	working	properly	.
Would	somebody	get	us	started	by	giving	us	a	two-digit	number	please	?
How	about	a	two-digit	number	?
Audience	:	22	.
Arthur	Benjamin	:	22	.	And	another	two-digit	number	,	Sir	?
Audience	:	47	.
AB	:	Multiply	22	times	47	,	make	sure	you	get	1,034	,	or	the	calculators	are	not	working	.	Do	all	of	you	get	1,034	?	1,034	?
Woman	:	No	.
AB	:	594	.	Let	's	give	three	of	them	a	nice	round	of	applause	there	.
Would	you	like	to	try	a	more	standard	calculator	,	just	in	case	?
OK	,	great	.
What	I	'm	going	to	try	and	do	then	--	I	notice	that	took	some	of	you	a	little	bit	of	time	to	get	your	answer	.
That	's	OK	.	I	'll	give	you	a	shortcut	for	multiplying	even	faster	on	the	calculator	.
There	is	something	called	the	square	of	a	number	,	which	most	of	you	know	is	taking	a	number	and	multiplying	it	by	itself	.
For	instance	,	five	squared	would	be	?
Audience	:	25	.
AB	:	25	.	Now	,	the	way	we	can	square	on	most	calculators	--	let	me	demonstrate	with	this	one	--	is	by	taking	the	number	,	such	as	five	,	hitting	``	times	''	and	then	``	equals	,	''	and	on	most	calculators	that	will	give	you	the	square	.
On	some	of	these	ancient	RPN	calculators	,	you	've	got	an	``	x	squared	''	button	on	it	,	will	allow	you	to	do	the	calculation	even	faster	.
What	I	'm	going	to	try	and	do	now	is	to	square	,	in	my	head	,	four	two-digit	numbers	faster	than	they	can	do	on	their	calculators	,	even	using	the	shortcut	method	.
What	I	'll	use	is	the	second	row	this	time	,	and	I	'll	get	four	of	you	--	one	,	two	,	three	,	four	--	to	each	yell	out	a	two-digit	number	,	and	if	you	would	square	the	first	number	,	and	if	you	would	square	the	second	,	the	third	and	the	fourth	,	I	will	try	and	race	you	to	the	answer	.	OK	?
So	quickly	,	a	two-digit	number	please	.
Audience	:	37	.
AB	:	37	squared	,	OK	.
Audience	:	23	.
AB	:	23	squared	,	OK	.
Audience	:	59	.
AB	:	59	squared	,	OK	,	and	finally	?
Audience	:	93	.
AB	:	93	squared	.	Would	you	call	out	your	answers	,	please	?
Woman	:	1369	.	AB	:	1369	.
Woman	:	529	.
AB	:	529	.
Man	:	3481	.
AB	:	3481	.
Man	:	8649	.
AB	:	Thank	you	very	much	.
Let	me	try	to	take	this	one	step	further	.
I	'm	going	to	try	to	square	some	three-digit	numbers	this	time	.
I	wo	n't	even	write	these	down	--	I	'll	just	call	them	out	as	they	're	called	out	to	me	.
Anyone	I	point	to	,	call	out	a	three-digit	number	.
Anyone	on	our	panel	,	verify	the	answer	.
Just	give	some	indication	if	it	's	right	.
A	three-digit	number	,	sir	,	yes	?
Audience	:	987	.
AB	:	987	squared	is	974,169	.
Yes	?	Good	.
Another	,	another	three-digit	--	--	another	three-digit	number	,	sir	?
Audience	:	457	.
AB	:	457	squared	is	205,849	.
205,849	?
Yes	?
OK	,	another	,	another	three-digit	number	,	sir	?
Audience	:	321	.
AB	:	321	is	103,041	.	103,041	.
Yes	?	One	more	three-digit	number	please	.
Audience	:	Oh	,	722	.
AB	:	722	is	500	--	ooh	,	that	's	a	harder	one	.
Is	that	513,284	?
Woman	:	Yes	.
AB	:	Yes	?	Oh	,	one	more	,	one	more	three-digit	number	please	.
Audience	:	162	.
162	squared	is	26,244	.
Thank	you	very	much	.
Let	me	try	to	take	this	one	step	further	.
I	'm	going	to	try	to	square	a	four-digit	number	this	time	.
Now	you	can	all	take	your	time	on	this	;	I	will	not	beat	you	to	the	answer	on	this	one	,	but	I	will	try	to	get	the	answer	right	.
To	make	this	a	little	bit	more	random	,	let	's	take	the	fourth	row	this	time	,	let	's	say	,	one	,	two	,	three	,	four	.
If	each	of	you	would	call	out	a	single	digit	between	zero	and	nine	,	that	will	be	the	four-digit	number	that	I	'll	square	.
Audience	:	Nine	.
AB	:	Nine	.
Audience	:	Seven	.	AB	:	Seven	.
Audience	:	Five	.	AB	:	Five	.
Audience	:	Eight	.	AB	:	Eight	.
9,758	,	this	will	take	me	a	little	bit	of	time	,	so	bear	with	me	.
95,218,564	?
Woman	:	Yes	.
AB	:	Thank	you	very	much	.
Now	,	I	would	attempt	to	square	a	five-digit	number	--	and	I	can	--	but	unfortunately	most	calculators	can	not	.
Eight-digit	capacity	--	do	n't	you	hate	that	?
So	,	since	we	've	reached	the	limits	of	our	calculators	--	what	's	that	?	Does	yours	go	--	Woman	:	I	do	n't	know	.
AB	:	Does	yours	go	higher	?
Oh	--	yours	does	?
Man	:	I	can	probably	do	it	.
AB	:	I	'll	talk	to	you	later	.
In	the	meanwhile	,	let	me	conclude	the	first	part	of	my	show	by	doing	something	a	little	trickier	.
Let	's	take	the	largest	number	on	the	board	here	,	8649	.
Would	you	each	enter	that	on	your	calculator	?
And	instead	of	squaring	it	this	time	,	I	want	you	to	take	that	number	and	multiply	it	by	any	three-digit	number	that	you	want	,	but	do	n't	tell	me	what	you	're	multiplying	by	--	just	multiply	it	by	any	random	three-digit	number	.
So	you	should	have	as	an	answer	either	a	six-digit	or	probably	a	seven-digit	number	.
How	many	digits	do	you	have	,	six	or	seven	?
Seven	,	and	yours	?	Woman	:	Seven	.
AB	:	Seven	?	Seven	?
And	,	uncertain	.
Man	:	Yeah	.
AB	:	Seven	.	Is	there	any	possible	way	that	I	could	know	what	seven	digit	numbers	you	have	?	Say	``	No	.	''
Good	.	Then	I	shall	attempt	the	impossible	--	or	at	least	the	improbable	.
What	I	'd	like	each	of	you	to	do	is	to	call	out	for	me	any	six	of	your	seven	digits	,	any	six	of	them	,	in	any	order	you	'd	like	.
One	digit	at	a	time	,	I	shall	try	and	determine	the	digit	you	've	left	out	.
So	,	starting	with	your	seven-digit	number	,	call	out	any	six	of	them	please	.
Woman	:	One	,	OK	,	197042	.
AB	:	Did	you	leave	out	the	number	6	?
Woman	:	Yes	,	AB	:	Good	,	OK	,	that	's	one	.
You	have	a	seven-digit	number	,	call	out	any	six	of	them	please	.
Woman	:	44875	.
AB	:	I	think	I	only	heard	five	numbers	.	I	--	wait	--	44875	--	did	you	leave	out	the	number	6	?
Woman	:	Yes	.	AB	:	Same	as	she	did	,	OK.	You	've	got	a	seven-digit	number	--	call	out	any	six	of	them	loud	and	clear	.
Man	:	079044	.	AB	:	I	think	you	left	out	the	number	3	?
That	's	three	.	The	odds	of	me	getting	all	four	of	these	right	by	random	guessing	would	be	one	in	10,000	:	10	to	the	fourth	power	.
OK	,	any	six	of	them	.
Really	scramble	them	up	this	time	,	please	.
Man	:	263972	.
AB	:	Did	you	leave	out	the	number	7	?
And	let	's	give	all	four	of	these	people	a	nice	round	of	applause	.
Thank	you	very	much	.
For	my	next	number	--	while	I	mentally	recharge	my	batteries	,	I	have	one	more	question	for	the	audience	.
By	any	chance	,	does	anybody	here	happen	to	know	the	day	of	the	week	that	they	were	born	on	?
If	you	think	you	know	your	birth	day	,	raise	your	hand	.
Let	's	see	,	starting	with	--	let	's	start	with	a	gentleman	first	,
OK	sir	,	what	year	was	it	,	first	of	all	?	That	's	why	I	start	with	a	gentleman	first	.
What	year	?
Audience	:	1953	.
AB	:	1953	,	and	the	month	?
Audience	:	November	.	AB	:	November	what	?
Audience	:	23rd	.
AB	:	23rd	--	was	that	a	Monday	?	Audience	:	Yes	.
Yes	,	good	.	Somebody	else	?	Who	else	would	like	--	see	I	do	n't	--	have	n't	seen	any	women	's	hands	up	.
OK	,	it	's	--	how	about	you	,	what	year	?
Audience	:	1949	.	AB	:	1949	,	and	the	month	?
Audience	:	October	.	AB	:	October	what	?
Audience	:	Fifth	.
AB	:	Fifth	--	was	that	a	Wednesday	?
Yes	,	my	--	I	'll	go	way	to	the	back	right	now	,	how	about	you	?
Yell	it	out	,	what	year	?	Audience	:	1959	.
AB	:	1959	,	OK	--	and	the	month	?
Audience	:	February	.
AB	:	February	what	?	Audience	:	Sixth	.
AB	:	Sixth	--	was	that	a	Friday	?	Audience	:	Yes	.
Good	,	how	about	the	person	behind	her	?
Call	--	call	--	what	year	was	it	?
Audience	:	1947	.	AB	:	1947	,	and	the	month	?
Audience	:	May	.	AB	:	May	what	?
Audience	:	Seventh	.	AB	:	Seventh	--	would	that	be	a	Wednesday	?
Audience	:	Yes	.
AB	:	Thank	you	very	much	.
Anybody	here	who	'd	like	to	know	the	day	of	the	week	they	were	born	?
We	can	do	it	that	way	.
Of	course	,	I	could	just	make	up	an	answer	and	you	would	n't	know	,	so	I	come	prepared	for	that	.
I	brought	with	me	a	book	of	calendars	.
It	goes	as	far	back	into	the	past	as	1800	,	'cause	you	never	know	.
I	did	n't	mean	to	look	at	you	,	sir	--	you	were	just	sitting	there	.
Anyway	,	Chris	,	you	can	help	me	out	here	,	if	you	would	n't	mind	.
This	is	a	book	of	calendars	,	and	I	'll	ask	--	who	was	it	that	wanted	to	know	their	birth	day	?	You	sir	?	OK	.
What	year	was	it	,	first	of	all	?
Audience	:	1966	.
AB	:	'66	--	turn	to	the	calendar	with	1966	--	and	what	month	?
Audience	:	April	.	AB	:	April	what	?
Audience	:	17th	.	AB	:	17th	--	I	believe	that	was	a	Sunday	.
Can	you	confirm	,	Chris	?
Chris	Anderson	:	Yes	.	AB	:	Yeah	,	OK	.	I	'll	tell	you	what	,	Chris	:	as	long	as	you	have	that	book	in	front	of	you	,	do	me	a	favor	,	turn	to	a	year	outside	of	the	1900s	,
either	into	the	1800s	or	way	into	the	2000s	--	that	'll	be	a	much	greater	challenge	for	me	.
What	year	,	Chris	,	would	you	like	?
CA	:	1824	.
AB	:	1824	,	OK	.
And	what	month	?	CA	:	June	.
AB	:	June	what	?	CA	:	Sixth	.
AB	:	Sixth	--	was	that	a	Sunday	?
CA	:	It	was	.	AB	:	And	it	was	cloudy	.
Good	,	thank	you	very	much	.
But	I	'd	like	to	wrap	things	up	now	by	alluding	to	something	from	earlier	in	the	presentation	.
There	was	a	gentleman	up	here	who	had	a	10-digit	calculator	.
Where	is	he	,	would	you	stand	up	,	10-digit	guy	?
OK	,	well	stand	up	for	me	just	for	a	second	,	so	I	can	see	where	you	are	.
OK	,	oh	,	OK	--	you	have	a	10-digit	calculator	,	sir	,	as	well	?
OK	,	what	I	'm	going	to	try	and	do	,	is	to	square	in	my	head	a	five-digit	number	requiring	a	10-digit	calculator	.
But	to	make	my	job	more	interesting	for	you	,	as	well	as	for	me	,	I	'm	going	to	do	this	problem	thinking	out	loud	.
So	you	can	actually	,	honestly	hear	what	's	going	on	in	my	mind	while	I	do	a	calculation	of	this	size	.
Now	,	I	have	to	apologize	to	our	magician	friend	Lennart	Green	.
I	know	as	a	magician	we	're	not	supposed	to	reveal	our	secrets	,	but	I	'm	not	too	afraid	that	people	are	going	to	start	doing	my	show	next	week	,	so	--	I	think	we	're	OK	.
So	,	let	's	see	,	let	's	take	a	--	let	's	take	a	different	row	of	people	,	starting	with	you	.
I	'll	get	five	digits	:	one	,	two	,	three	,	four	--	oh	,	I	did	this	row	already	.	Let	's	do	the	row	before	you	,	starting	with	you	sir	:	one	,	two	,	three	,	four	,	five	.
Call	out	a	single	digit	--	that	will	be	the	five-digit	number	that	I	will	try	to	square	.	Go	ahead	.
Audience	:	Five	.	AB	:	Five	.
Audience	:	Seven	.	AB	:	Seven	.
Audience	:	Six	.	AB	:	Six	.
Audience	:	Eight	.	AB	:	Eight	.
Audience	:	Three	.	AB	:	Three	.
57,683	squared	.	Yuck	.
Let	me	explain	to	you	how	I	'm	going	to	attempt	this	problem	.
I	'm	going	to	break	the	problem	down	into	three	parts	.
I	'll	do	57,000	squared	,	plus	683	squared	,	plus	57,000	times	683	times	two	.
Add	all	those	numbers	together	,	and	with	any	luck	,	arrive	at	the	answer	.
Now	,	let	me	recap	.
Thank	you	.
While	I	explain	something	else	--	--	I	know	,	that	you	can	use	,	right	?
While	I	do	these	calculation	[	s	]	,	you	might	hear	certain	words	,	as	opposed	to	numbers	,	creep	into	the	calculation	.
Let	me	explain	what	that	is	.
This	is	a	phonetic	code	,	a	mnemonic	device	that	I	use	,	that	allows	me	to	convert	numbers	into	words	.
I	store	them	as	words	,	and	later	on	retrieve	them	as	numbers	.
I	know	it	sounds	complicated	;	it	's	not	--	I	just	do	n't	want	you	to	think	you	're	seeing	something	out	of	``	Rain	Man	''	here	.
There	's	definitely	a	method	to	my	madness	--	definitely	,	definitely	.	Sorry	.
If	you	want	to	talk	to	me	about	ADHD	afterwards	,	you	can	talk	to	me	then	.	All	right	--	by	the	way	,	one	last	instruction	,	for	my	judges	with	the	calculators	--	OK	,	you	know	who	you	are	--	there	is	at	least	a	50	percent	chance	that	I	will	make	a	mistake	here	.
If	I	do	,	do	n't	tell	me	what	the	mistake	is	;
just	say	,	``	you	're	close	,	''	or	something	like	that	,	and	I	'll	try	and	figure	out	the	answer	--	which	could	be	pretty	entertaining	in	itself	.
If	,	however	,	I	am	right	,	whatever	you	do	,	do	n't	keep	it	to	yourself	,	OK	?
Make	sure	everybody	knows	that	I	got	the	answer	right	,	because	this	is	my	big	finish	,	OK	.
So	,	without	any	more	stalling	,	here	we	go	.
I	'll	start	the	problem	in	the	middle	,	with	57	times	683	.
Now	,	57	times	68	is	3,400	,	plus	476	is	3876	,	that	's	38,760	plus	171	,	38,760	plus	171	is	38,931	.
38,931	;	double	that	to	get	77,862	.
77,862	becomes	cookie	fission	,	cookie	fission	is	77,822	.
That	seems	right	,	I	'll	go	on	.	Cookie	fission	,	OK	.
Next	,	I	do	57	squared	,	which	is	3,249	,	so	I	can	say	,	three	billion	.	Take	the	249	,	add	that	to	cookie	,	249	,	oops	,	but	I	see	a	carry	coming	--	249	--	add	that	to	cookie	,	250	plus	77	,	is	327	million	--	fission	,	fission	,	OK	,	finally	,	we	do	683	squared	,	that	's	700	times	666	,	plus	17	squared	is	466,489	,	rev	up	if	I	need	it	,	rev	up	,	take	the	466	,	add	that	to	fission	,	to	get	,	oh	gee	--	328,489	.
Audience	:	Yeah	!
AB	:	Good	.
Thank	you	very	much	.
I	hope	you	enjoyed	mathemagics	.	Thank	you	.
I	'm	delighted	to	be	here	.
I	'm	honored	by	the	invitation	,	and	thanks	.
I	would	love	to	talk	about	stuff	that	I	'm	interested	in	,	but	unfortunately	,	I	suspect	that	what	I	'm	interested	in	wo	n't	interest	many	other	people	.
First	off	,	my	badge	says	I	'm	an	astronomer	.
I	would	love	to	talk	about	my	astronomy	,	but	I	suspect	that	the	number	of	people	who	are	interested	in	radiative	transfer	in	non-gray	atmospheres	and	polarization	of	light	in	Jupiter	's	upper	atmosphere	are	the	number	of	people	who	'd	fit	in	a	bus	shelter	.
So	I	'm	not	going	to	talk	about	that	.
It	would	be	just	as	much	fun	to	talk	about	some	stuff	that	happened	in	1986	and	1987	,	when	a	computer	hacker	is	breaking	into	our	systems	over	at	Lawrence	Berkeley	Labs	.
And	I	caught	the	guys	,	and	they	turned	out	to	be	working	for	what	was	then	the	Soviet	KGB	,	and	stealing	information	and	selling	it	.
And	I	'd	love	to	talk	about	that	--	and	it	'd	be	fun	--	but	,	20	years	later	...
I	find	computer	security	,	frankly	,	to	be	kind	of	boring	.
It	's	tedious	.
I	'm	--	The	first	time	you	do	something	,	it	's	science	.
The	second	time	,	it	's	engineering	.
A	third	time	,	it	's	just	being	a	technician	.
I	'm	a	scientist	.	Once	I	do	something	,	I	do	something	else	.
So	,	I	'm	not	going	to	talk	about	that	.
Nor	am	I	going	to	talk	about	what	I	think	are	obvious	statements	from	my	first	book	,	``	Silicon	Snake	Oil	,	''	or	my	second	book	,	nor	am	I	going	to	talk	about	why	I	believe	computers	do	n't	belong	in	schools	.
I	feel	that	there	's	a	massive	and	bizarre	idea	going	around	that	we	have	to	bring	more	computers	into	schools	.
My	idea	is	:	no	!	No	!
Get	them	out	of	schools	,	and	keep	them	out	of	schools	.
And	I	'd	love	to	talk	about	this	,	but	I	think	the	argument	is	so	obvious	to	anyone	who	's	hung	around	a	fourth	grade	classroom	that	it	does	n't	need	much	talking	about	--	but	I	guess	I	may	be	very	wrong	about	that	,	and	everything	else	that	I	've	said	.
So	do	n't	go	back	and	read	my	dissertation	.
It	probably	has	lies	in	it	as	well	.
Having	said	that	,	I	outlined	my	talk	about	five	minutes	ago	.
And	if	you	look	at	it	over	here	,	the	main	thing	I	wrote	on	my	thumb	was	the	future	.
I	'm	supposed	to	talk	about	the	future	,	yes	?
Oh	,	right	.	And	my	feeling	is	,	asking	me	to	talk	about	the	future	is	bizarre	,	because	I	've	got	gray	hair	,	and	so	,	it	's	kind	of	silly	for	me	to	talk	about	the	future	.
In	fact	,	I	think	that	if	you	really	want	to	know	what	the	future	's	going	to	be	,	if	you	really	want	to	know	about	the	future	,	do	n't	ask	a	technologist	,	a	scientist	,	a	physicist	.
No	!	Do	n't	ask	somebody	who	's	writing	code	.
No	,	if	you	want	to	know	what	society	's	going	to	be	like	in	20	years	,	ask	a	kindergarten	teacher	.
They	know	.
In	fact	,	do	n't	ask	just	any	kindergarten	teacher	,	ask	an	experienced	one	.
They	're	the	ones	who	know	what	society	is	going	to	be	like	in	another	generation	.
I	do	n't	.	Nor	,	I	suspect	,	do	many	other	people	who	are	talking	about	what	the	future	will	bring	.
Certainly	,	all	of	us	can	imagine	these	cool	new	things	that	are	going	to	be	there	.
But	to	me	,	things	are	n't	the	future	.
What	I	ask	myself	is	,	what	's	society	is	going	to	be	like	,	when	the	kids	today	are	phenomenally	good	at	text	messaging	and	spend	a	huge	amount	of	on-screen	time	,	but	have	never	gone	bowling	together	?
Change	is	happening	,	and	the	change	that	is	happening	is	not	one	that	is	in	software	.
But	that	's	not	what	I	'm	going	to	talk	about	.
I	'd	love	to	talk	about	it	,	it	'd	be	fun	,	but	I	want	to	talk	about	what	I	'm	doing	now	.	What	am	I	doing	now	?
Oh	--	the	other	thing	that	I	think	I	'd	like	to	talk	about	is	right	over	here	.	Right	over	here	.
Is	that	visible	?	What	I	'd	like	to	talk	about	is	one-sided	things	.
I	would	dearly	love	to	talk	about	things	that	have	one	side	.
Because	I	love	Mobius	loops	.	I	not	only	love	Mobius	loops	,	but	I	'm	one	of	the	very	few	people	,	if	not	the	only	person	in	the	world	,	that	makes	Klein	bottles	.
Right	away	,	I	hope	that	all	of	your	eyes	glaze	over	.
This	is	a	Klein	bottle	.
For	those	of	you	in	the	audience	who	know	,	you	roll	your	eyes	and	say	,	yup	,	I	know	all	about	it	.
It	's	one	sided	.	It	's	a	bottle	whose	inside	is	its	outside	.
It	has	zero	volume	.	And	it	's	non-orientable	.
It	has	wonderful	properties	.
If	you	take	two	Mobius	loops	and	sew	their	common	edge	together	,	you	get	one	of	these	,	and	I	make	them	out	of	glass	.
And	I	'd	love	to	talk	to	you	about	this	,	but	I	do	n't	have	much	in	the	way	of	...	things	to	say	because	--	However	,	the	``	D	''	in	TED	of	course	stands	for	design	.
Just	two	weeks	ago	I	made	--	you	know	,	I	've	been	making	small	,	medium	and	big	Klein	bottles	for	the	trade	.
But	what	I	've	just	made	--	and	I	'm	delighted	to	show	you	,	first	time	in	public	here	.
This	is	a	Klein	bottle	wine	bottle	,	which	,	although	in	four	dimensions	it	should	n't	be	able	to	hold	any	fluid	at	all	,	it	's	perfectly	capable	of	doing	so	because	our	universe	has	only	three	spatial	dimensions	.
And	because	our	universe	is	only	three	spatial	dimensions	,	it	can	hold	fluids	.
So	it	's	highly	--	that	one	's	the	cool	one	.
That	was	a	month	of	my	life	.
But	although	I	would	love	to	talk	about	topology	with	you	,	I	'm	not	going	to	.
Instead	,	I	'm	going	to	mention	my	mom	,	who	passed	away	last	summer	.
Had	collected	photographs	of	me	,	as	mothers	will	do	.
Could	somebody	put	this	guy	up	?
And	I	looked	over	her	album	and	she	had	collected	a	picture	of	me	,	standing	--	well	,	sitting	--	in	1969	,	in	front	of	a	bunch	of	dials	.
And	I	looked	at	it	,	and	said	,	oh	my	god	,	that	was	me	,	when	I	was	working	at	the	electronic	music	studio	!
As	a	technician	,	repairing	and	maintaining	the	electronic	music	studio	at	SUNY	Buffalo	.	And	wow	!
Way	back	machine	.	And	I	said	to	myself	,	oh	yeah	!
And	it	sent	me	back	.
Soon	after	that	,	I	found	in	another	picture	that	she	had	,	a	picture	of	me	.
This	guy	over	here	of	course	is	me	.
This	man	is	Robert	Moog	,	the	inventor	of	the	Moog	synthesizer	,	who	passed	away	this	past	August	.
Robert	Moog	was	a	generous	,	kind	person	,	extraordinarily	competent	engineer	.
A	musician	who	took	time	from	his	life	to	teach	me	,	a	sophomore	,	a	freshman	at	SUNY	Buffalo	.
He	'd	come	up	from	Trumansburg	to	teach	me	not	just	about	the	Moog	synthesizer	,	but	we	'd	be	sitting	there	--	I	'm	studying	physics	at	the	time	.	This	is	1969	,	70	,	71	.
We	're	studying	physics	,	I	'm	studying	physics	,	and	he	's	saying	,	``	That	's	a	good	thing	to	do	.
Do	n't	get	caught	up	in	electronic	music	if	you	're	doing	physics	.	''
Mentoring	me	.	He	'd	come	up	and	spend	hours	and	hours	with	me	.
He	wrote	a	letter	of	recommendation	for	me	to	get	into	graduate	school	.
In	the	background	,	my	bicycle	.
I	realize	that	this	picture	was	taken	at	a	friend	's	living	room	.
Bob	Moog	came	by	and	hauled	a	whole	pile	of	equipment	to	show	Greg	Flint	and	I	things	about	this	.
We	sat	around	talking	about	Fourier	transforms	,
Bessel	functions	,	modulation	transfer	functions	,	stuff	like	this	.
Bob	's	passing	this	past	summer	has	been	a	loss	to	all	of	us	.
Anyone	who	's	a	musician	has	been	profoundly	influenced	by	Robert	Moog	.
And	I	'll	just	say	what	I	'm	about	to	do	.	What	I	'm	about	to	do	--	I	hope	you	can	recognize	that	there	's	a	distorted	sine	wave	,	almost	a	triangular	wave	upon	this	Hewlett-Packard	oscilloscope	.
Oh	,	cool	.	I	can	get	to	this	place	over	here	,	right	?
Kids	.	Kids	is	what	I	'm	going	to	talk	about	--	is	that	okay	?
It	says	kids	over	here	,	that	's	what	I	'd	like	to	talk	about	.
I	've	decided	that	,	for	me	at	least	,	I	do	n't	have	a	big	enough	head	.
So	I	think	locally	and	I	act	locally	.
I	feel	that	the	best	way	I	can	help	out	anything	is	to	help	out	very	,	very	locally	.
So	Ph.D.	this	,	and	degree	there	,	and	the	yadda	yadda	.
I	was	talking	about	this	stuff	to	some	schoolteachers	about	a	year	ago	.
And	one	of	them	,	several	of	them	would	come	up	to	me	and	say	,	``	Well	,	how	come	you	ai	n't	teaching	?	''
And	I	said	,	``	Well	,	I	've	taught	graduate	--	I	've	had	graduate	students	,	I	've	taught	undergraduate	classes	.	''
No	,	they	said	,	``	If	you	're	so	into	kids	and	all	this	stuff	,	how	come	you	ai	n't	over	here	on	the	front	lines	?
Put	your	money	where	you	mouth	is	.	''
Is	true	.	Is	true	.	I	teach	eighth-grade	science	four	days	a	week	.
Not	just	showing	up	every	now	and	then	.
No	,	no	,	no	,	no	,	no	.	I	take	attendance	.
I	take	lunch	hour	.
This	is	not	--	no	,	no	,	no	,	this	is	not	claps	.
I	strongly	suggest	that	this	is	a	good	thing	for	each	of	you	to	do	.
Not	just	show	up	to	class	every	now	and	then	.
Teach	a	solid	week	.	Okay	,	I	'm	teaching	three-quarters	time	,	but	good	enough	.
One	of	the	things	that	I	've	done	for	my	science	students	is	to	tell	them	,	``	Look	,	I	'm	going	to	teach	you	college-level	physics	.
No	calculus	,	I	'll	cut	out	that	.
You	wo	n't	need	to	know	trig	.
But	you	will	need	to	know	eighth-grade	algebra	,	and	we	're	going	to	do	serious	experiments	.
None	of	this	open-to-chapter-seven-and-do-all-the-odd-problem-sets	.
We	're	going	to	be	doing	genuine	physics	.	''
And	that	's	one	of	the	things	I	thought	I	'd	do	right	now	.
Oh	,	before	I	even	turn	that	on	,	one	of	the	things	that	we	did	about	three	weeks	ago	in	my	class	--	this	is	through	the	lens	,	and	one	of	the	things	we	used	a	lens	for	was	to	measure	the	speed	of	light	.
My	students	in	El	Cerrito	--	with	my	help	,	of	course	,	and	with	the	help	of	a	very	beat	up	oscilloscope	--	measured	the	speed	of	light	.
We	were	off	by	25	percent	.	How	many	eighth	graders	do	you	know	of	who	have	measured	the	speed	of	light	?
In	addition	to	that	,	we	've	measured	the	speed	of	sound	.
I	'd	love	to	measure	the	speed	of	light	here	.
I	was	all	set	to	do	it	and	I	was	thinking	,	``	Aw	man	,	''
I	was	just	going	to	impose	upon	the	powers	that	be	,	and	measure	the	speed	of	light	.
And	I	'm	all	set	to	do	it	.	I	'm	all	set	to	do	it	,	but	then	it	turns	out	that	to	set	up	here	,	you	have	like	10	minutes	to	set	up	!
And	there	's	no	time	to	do	it	.
So	,	next	time	,	maybe	,	I	'll	measure	the	speed	of	light	!
But	meanwhile	,	let	's	measure	the	speed	of	sound	!
Well	,	the	obvious	way	to	measure	the	speed	of	sound	is	to	bounce	sound	off	something	and	look	at	the	echo	.
But	,	probably	--	one	of	my	students	,	Ariel	[	unclear	]	,	said	,	``	Could	we	measure	the	speed	of	light	using	the	wave	equation	?	''
And	all	of	you	know	the	wave	equation	is	the	frequency	times	the	wavelength	of	any	wave	...
is	a	constant	.	When	the	frequency	goes	up	,	the	wavelength	comes	down	.	Wavelength	goes	up	,	frequency	goes	down	.	So	,	if	we	have	a	wave	here	--	over	here	,	that	's	what	's	interesting	--	as	the	pitch	goes	up	,	things	get	closer	,	pitch	goes	down	,	things	stretch	out	.
Right	?	This	is	simple	physics	.
All	of	you	know	this	from	eighth	grade	,	remember	?
What	they	did	n't	tell	you	in	physics	--	in	eighth-grade	physics	--	but	they	should	have	,	and	I	wish	they	had	,	was	that	if	you	multiply	the	frequency	times	the	wavelength	of	sound	or	light	,	you	get	a	constant	.
And	that	constant	is	the	speed	of	sound	.
So	,	in	order	to	measure	the	speed	of	sound	,	all	I	've	got	to	do	is	know	its	frequency	.	Well	,	that	's	easy	.
I	've	got	a	frequency	counter	right	here	.
Set	it	up	to	around	A	,	above	A	,	above	A	.	There	's	an	A	,	more	or	less	.
Now	,	so	I	know	the	frequency	.
It	's	1.76	kilohertz	.	I	measure	its	wavelength	.
All	I	need	now	is	to	flip	on	another	beam	,	and	the	bottom	beam	is	me	talking	,	right	?
So	anytime	I	talk	,	you	'd	see	it	on	the	screen	.
I	'll	put	it	over	here	,	and	as	I	move	this	away	from	the	source	,	you	'll	notice	the	spiral	.
The	slinky	moves	.	We	're	going	through	different	nodes	of	the	wave	,	coming	out	this	way	.
Those	of	you	who	are	physicists	,	I	hear	you	rolling	your	eyes	,	but	bear	with	me	.
To	measure	the	wavelength	,	all	I	need	to	do	is	measure	the	distance	from	here	--	one	full	wave	--	over	to	here	.
From	here	to	here	is	the	wavelength	of	sound	.
So	,	I	'll	put	a	measuring	tape	here	,	measuring	tape	here	,	move	it	back	over	to	here	.
I	've	moved	the	microphone	20	centimeters	.
0.2	meters	from	here	,	back	to	here	,	20	centimeters	.
OK	,	let	's	go	back	to	Mr.	Elmo	.
And	we	'll	say	the	frequency	is	1.76	kilohertz	,	or	1760	.
The	wavelength	was	0.2	meters	.
Let	's	figure	out	what	this	is	.
1.76	times	0.2	over	here	is	352	meters	per	second	.
If	you	look	it	up	in	the	book	,	it	's	really	343	.
But	,	here	with	kludgy	material	,	and	lousy	drink	--	we	've	been	able	to	measure	the	speed	of	sound	to	--	not	bad	.	Pretty	good	.
All	of	which	comes	to	what	I	wanted	to	say	.
Go	back	to	this	picture	of	me	a	million	years	ago	.
It	was	1971	,	the	Vietnam	War	was	going	on	,	and	I	'm	like	,	``	Oh	my	God	!	''
I	'm	studying	physics	:	Landau	,	Lipschitz	,	Resnick	and	Halliday	.
I	'm	going	home	for	a	midterm	.	A	riot	's	going	on	on	campus	.
There	's	a	riot	!	Hey	,	Elmo	's	done	:	off	.
There	's	a	riot	going	on	on	campus	,	and	the	police	are	chasing	me	,	right	?
I	'm	walking	across	campus	.	Cop	comes	and	looks	at	me	and	says	,	``	You	!	You	're	a	student	.	''
Pulls	out	a	gun	.	Goes	boom	!
And	a	tear	gas	canister	the	size	of	a	Pepsi	can	goes	by	my	head	.	Whoosh	!
I	get	a	breath	of	tear	gas	and	I	ca	n't	breathe	.
This	cop	comes	after	me	with	a	rifle	.
He	wants	to	clunk	me	over	the	head	!
I	'm	saying	,	``	I	got	to	clear	out	of	here	!	''
I	go	running	across	campus	quick	as	I	can	.	I	duck	into	Hayes	Hall	.
It	's	one	of	these	bell-tower	buildings	.
The	cop	's	chasing	me	.
Chasing	me	up	the	first	floor	,	second	floor	,	third	floor	.
Chases	me	into	this	room	.
The	entranceway	to	the	bell	tower	.
I	slam	the	door	behind	me	,	climb	up	,	go	past	this	place	where	I	see	a	pendulum	ticking	.
And	I	'm	thinking	,	``	Oh	yeah	,	the	square	root	of	the	length	is	proportional	to	its	period	.	''
I	keep	climbing	up	,	go	back	.
I	go	to	a	place	where	a	dowel	splits	off	.
There	's	a	clock	,	clock	,	clock	,	clock	.
The	time	's	going	backwards	because	I	'm	inside	of	it	.
I	'm	thinking	of	Lorenz	contractions	and	Einsteinian	relativity	.
I	climb	up	,	and	there	's	this	place	,	way	in	the	back	,	that	you	climb	up	this	wooden	ladder	.
I	pop	up	the	top	,	and	there	's	a	cupola	.
A	dome	,	one	of	these	ten-foot	domes	.
I	'm	looking	out	and	I	'm	seeing	the	cops	bashing	students	'	heads	,	shooting	tear	gas	,	and	watching	students	throwing	bricks	.
And	I	'm	asking	,	``	What	am	I	doing	here	?	Why	am	I	here	?	''
Then	I	remember	what	my	English	teacher	in	high	school	said	.	Namely	,	that	when	they	cast	bells	,	they	write	inscriptions	on	them	.
So	,	I	wipe	the	pigeon	manure	off	one	of	the	bells	,	and	I	look	at	it	.
I	'm	asking	myself	,	``	Why	am	I	here	?	''
So	,	at	this	time	,	I	'd	like	to	tell	you	the	words	inscribed	upon	the	Hayes	Hall	tower	bells	:	``	All	truth	is	one	.
In	this	light	,	may	science	and	religion	endeavor	here	for	the	steady	evolution	of	mankind	,	from	darkness	to	light	,	from	narrowness	to	broad-mindedness	,	from	prejudice	to	tolerance	.
It	is	the	voice	of	life	,	which	calls	us	to	come	and	learn	.	''
Thank	you	very	much	.
What	's	in	the	box	?
Whatever	it	is	must	be	pretty	important	,	because	I	've	traveled	with	it	,	moved	it	,	from	apartment	to	apartment	to	apartment	.
Sound	familiar	?
Did	you	know	that	we	Americans	have	about	three	times	the	amount	of	space	we	did	50	years	ago	?
Three	times	.
So	you	'd	think	,	with	all	this	extra	space	,	we	'd	have	plenty	of	room	for	all	our	stuff	.
Nope	.
There	's	a	new	industry	in	town	,	a	22	billion-dollar	,	2.2	billion	sq	.	ft.	industry	:	that	of	personal	storage	.
So	we	've	got	triple	the	space	,	but	we	've	become	such	good	shoppers	that	we	need	even	more	space	.
So	where	does	this	lead	?
Lots	of	credit	card	debt	,	huge	environmental	footprints	,	and	perhaps	not	coincidentally	,	our	happiness	levels	flat-lined	over	the	same	50	years	.
Well	I	'm	here	to	suggest	there	's	a	better	way	,	that	less	might	actually	equal	more	.
I	bet	most	of	us	have	experienced	at	some	point	the	joys	of	less	:	college	--	in	your	dorm	,	traveling	--	in	a	hotel	room	,	camping	--	rig	up	basically	nothing	,	maybe	a	boat	.
Whatever	it	was	for	you	,	I	bet	that	,	among	other	things	,	this	gave	you	a	little	more	freedom	,	a	little	more	time	.
So	I	'm	going	to	suggest	that	less	stuff	and	less	space	are	going	to	equal	a	smaller	footprint	.
It	's	actually	a	great	way	to	save	you	some	money	.
And	it	's	going	to	give	you	a	little	more	ease	in	your	life	.
So	I	started	a	project	called	Life	Edited	at	lifeedited.org	to	further	this	conversation	and	to	find	some	great	solutions	in	this	area	.
First	up	:	crowd-sourcing	my	420	sq	.	ft.	apartment	in	Manhattan	with	partners	Mutopo	and	Jovoto.com	.
I	wanted	it	all	--	home	office	,	sit	down	dinner	for	10	,	room	for	guests	,	and	all	my	kite	surfing	gear	.
With	over	300	entries	from	around	the	world	,	I	got	it	,	my	own	little	jewel	box	.
By	buying	a	space	that	was	420	sq	.	ft.	instead	of	600	,	immediately	I	'm	saving	200	grand	.
Smaller	space	is	going	to	make	for	smaller	utilities	--	save	some	more	money	there	,	but	also	a	smaller	footprint	.
And	because	it	's	really	designed	around	an	edited	set	of	possessions	--	my	favorite	stuff	--	and	really	designed	for	me	,	I	'm	really	excited	to	be	there	.
So	how	can	you	live	little	?
Three	main	approaches	.
First	of	all	,	you	have	to	edit	ruthlessly	.
We	've	got	to	clear	the	arteries	of	our	lives	.
And	that	shirt	that	I	had	n't	worn	in	years	?
It	's	time	for	me	to	let	it	go	.
We	've	got	to	cut	the	extraneous	out	of	our	lives	,	and	we	've	got	to	learn	to	stem	the	inflow	.
We	need	to	think	before	we	buy	.
Ask	ourselves	,	``	Is	that	really	going	to	make	me	happier	?	Truly	?	''	By	all	means	,	we	should	buy	and	own	some	great	stuff	.
But	we	want	stuff	that	we	're	going	to	love	for	years	,	not	just	stuff	.
Secondly	,	our	new	mantra	:	small	is	sexy	.
We	want	space	efficiency	.
We	want	things	that	are	designed	for	how	they	're	used	the	vast	majority	of	the	time	,	not	that	rare	event	.
Why	have	a	six	burner	stove	when	you	rarely	use	three	?
So	we	want	things	that	nest	,	we	want	things	that	stack	,	and	we	want	it	digitized	.
You	can	take	paperwork	,	books	,	movies	,	and	you	can	make	it	disappear	--	it	's	magic	.
Finally	,	we	want	multifunctional	spaces	and	housewares	--	a	sink	combined	with	a	toilet	,	a	dining	table	becomes	a	bed	--	same	space	,	a	little	side	table	stretches	out	to	seat	10	.
In	the	winning	Life	Edited	scheme	in	a	render	here	,	we	combine	a	moving	wall	with	transformer	furniture	to	get	a	lot	out	of	the	space	.
Look	at	the	coffee	table	--	it	grows	in	height	and	width	to	seat	10	.
My	office	folds	away	,
easily	hidden	.
My	bed	just	pops	out	of	the	wall	with	two	fingers	.
Guests	?	Move	the	moving	wall	,	have	some	fold-down	guest	beds	.
And	of	course	,	my	own	movie	theater	.
So	I	'm	not	saying	that	we	all	need	to	live	in	420	sq	.	ft	.
But	consider	the	benefits	of	an	edited	life	.
Go	from	3,000	to	2,000	,	from	1,500	to	1,000	.
Most	of	us	,	maybe	all	of	us	,	are	here	pretty	happily	for	a	bunch	of	days	with	a	couple	of	bags	,	maybe	a	small	space	,	a	hotel	room	.
So	when	you	go	home	and	you	walk	through	your	front	door	,	take	a	second	and	ask	yourselves	,	``	Could	I	do	with	a	little	life	editing	?
Would	that	give	me	a	little	more	freedom	?
Maybe	a	little	more	time	?	''	What	's	in	the	box	?
It	does	n't	really	matter	.
I	know	I	do	n't	need	it	.
What	's	in	yours	?
Maybe	,	just	maybe	,	less	might	equal	more	.
So	let	's	make	room	for	the	good	stuff	.
Thank	you	.
So	,	here	we	go	:	a	flyby	of	play	.	It	's	got	to	be	serious	if	the	New	York	Times	puts	a	cover	story	of	their	February	17th	Sunday	magazine	about	play	.
At	the	bottom	of	this	,	it	says	,	``	It	's	deeper	than	gender	.
Seriously	,	but	dangerously	fun	.
And	a	sandbox	for	new	ideas	about	evolution	.	''
Not	bad	,	except	if	you	look	at	that	cover	,	what	's	missing	?
You	see	any	adults	?
Well	,	lets	go	back	to	the	15th	century	.	This	is	a	courtyard	in	Europe	,	and	a	mixture	of	124	different	kinds	of	play	.
All	ages	,	solo	play	,	body	play	,	games	,	taunting	.
And	there	it	is	.	And	I	think	this	is	a	typical	picture	of	what	it	was	like	in	a	courtyard	then	.
I	think	we	may	have	lost	something	in	our	culture	.
So	I	'm	gon	na	take	you	through	what	I	think	is	a	remarkable	sequence	.
North	of	Churchill	,	Manitoba	,	in	October	and	November	,	there	's	no	ice	on	Hudson	Bay	.
And	this	polar	bear	that	you	see	,	this	1200-pound	male	,	he	's	wild	and	fairly	hungry	.
And	Norbert	Rosing	,	a	German	photographer	,	is	there	on	scene	,	making	a	series	of	photos	of	these	huskies	,	who	are	tethered	.
And	from	out	of	stage	left	comes	this	wild	,	male	polar	bear	,	with	a	predatory	gaze	.
Any	of	you	who	've	been	to	Africa	or	had	a	junkyard	dog	come	after	you	,	there	is	a	fixed	kind	of	predatory	gaze	that	you	know	you	're	in	trouble	.
But	on	the	other	side	of	that	predatory	gaze	is	a	female	husky	in	a	play	bow	,	wagging	her	tail	.
And	something	very	unusual	happens	.
That	fixed	behavior	--	which	is	rigid	and	stereotyped	and	ends	up	with	a	meal	--	changes	.
And	this	polar	bear	stands	over	the	husky	,
no	claws	extended	,	no	fangs	taking	a	look	.
And	they	begin	an	incredible	ballet	.
A	play	ballet	.
This	is	in	nature	:	it	overrides	a	carnivorous	nature	and	what	otherwise	would	have	been	a	short	fight	to	the	death	.
And	if	you	'll	begin	to	look	closely	at	the	husky	that	's	bearing	her	throat	to	the	polar	bear	,	and	look	a	little	more	closely	,	they	're	in	an	altered	state	.
They	're	in	a	state	of	play	.
And	it	's	that	state	that	allows	these	two	creatures	to	explore	the	possible	.
They	are	beginning	to	do	something	that	neither	would	have	done	without	the	play	signals	.
And	it	is	a	marvelous	example	of	how	a	differential	in	power	can	be	overridden	by	a	process	of	nature	that	's	within	all	of	us	.
Now	how	did	I	get	involved	in	this	?
John	mentioned	that	I	've	done	some	work	with	murderers	,	and	I	have	.
The	Texas	Tower	murderer	opened	my	eyes	,	in	retrospect	,	when	we	studied	his	tragic	mass	murder	,	to	the	importance	of	play	,	in	that	that	individual	,	by	deep	study	,	was	found	to	have	severe	play	deprivation	.
Charles	Whitman	was	his	name	.
And	our	committee	,	which	consisted	of	a	lot	of	hard	scientists	,	did	feel	at	the	end	of	that	study	that	the	absence	of	play	and	a	progressive	suppression	of	developmentally	normal	play	led	him	to	be	more	vulnerable	to	the	tragedy	that	he	perpetrated	.
And	that	finding	has	stood	the	test	of	time	--	unfortunately	even	into	more	recent	times	,	at	Virginia	Tech	.
And	other	studies	of	populations	at	risk	sensitized	me	to	the	importance	of	play	,	but	I	did	n't	really	understand	what	it	was	.
And	it	was	many	years	in	taking	play	histories	of	individuals	before	I	really	began	to	recognize	that	I	did	n't	really	have	a	full	understanding	of	it	.
And	I	do	n't	think	any	of	us	has	a	full	understanding	of	it	,	by	any	means	.
But	there	are	ways	of	looking	at	it	that	I	think	can	give	you	--	give	us	all	a	taxonomy	,	a	way	of	thinking	about	it	.
And	this	image	is	,	for	humans	,	the	beginning	point	of	play	.
When	that	mother	and	infant	lock	eyes	,	and	the	infant	's	old	enough	to	have	a	social	smile	,	what	happens	--	spontaneously	--	is	the	eruption	of	joy	on	the	part	of	the	mother	.
And	she	begins	to	babble	and	coo	and	smile	,	and	so	does	the	baby	.
If	we	've	got	them	wired	up	with	an	electroencephalogram	,	the	right	brain	of	each	of	them	becomes	attuned	,	so	that	the	joyful	emergence	of	this	earliest	of	play	scenes	and	the	physiology	of	that	is	something	we	're	beginning	to	get	a	handle	on	.
And	I	'd	like	you	to	think	that	every	bit	of	more	complex	play	builds	on	this	base	for	us	humans	.
And	so	now	I	'm	going	to	take	you	through	sort	of	a	way	of	looking	at	play	,	but	it	's	never	just	singularly	one	thing	.
We	're	going	to	look	at	body	play	,	which	is	a	spontaneous	desire	to	get	ourselves	out	of	gravity	.
This	is	a	mountain	goat	.
If	you	're	having	a	bad	day	,	try	this	:	jump	up	and	down	,	wiggle	around	--	you	're	going	to	feel	better	.
And	you	may	feel	like	this	character	,	who	is	also	just	doing	it	for	its	own	sake	.
It	does	n't	have	a	particular	purpose	,	and	that	's	what	's	great	about	play	.
If	its	purpose	is	more	important	than	the	act	of	doing	it	,	it	's	probably	not	play	.
And	there	's	a	whole	other	type	of	play	,	which	is	object	play	.
And	this	Japanese	macaque	has	made	a	snowball	,	and	he	or	she	's	going	to	roll	down	a	hill	.
And	--	they	do	n't	throw	it	at	each	other	,	but	this	is	a	fundamental	part	of	being	playful	.
The	human	hand	,	in	manipulation	of	objects	,	is	the	hand	in	search	of	a	brain	;
the	brain	is	in	search	of	a	hand	;	and	play	is	the	medium	by	which	those	two	are	linked	in	the	best	way	.
JPL	we	heard	this	morning	--	JPL	is	an	incredible	place	.
They	have	located	two	consultants	,	Frank	Wilson	and	Nate	Johnson	,
who	are	--	Frank	Wilson	is	a	neurologist	,	Nate	Johnson	is	a	mechanic	.
He	taught	mechanics	in	a	high	school	in	Long	Beach	,	and	found	that	his	students	were	no	longer	able	to	solve	problems	.
And	he	tried	to	figure	out	why	.	And	he	came	to	the	conclusion	,	quite	on	his	own	,	that	the	students	who	could	no	longer	solve	problems	,	such	as	fixing	cars	,	had	n't	worked	with	their	hands	.
Frank	Wilson	had	written	a	book	called	``	The	Hand	.	''
They	got	together	--	JPL	hired	them	.
Now	JPL	,	NASA	and	Boeing	,	before	they	will	hire	a	research	and	development	problem	solver	--	even	if	they	're	summa	cum	laude	from	Harvard	or	Cal	Tech	--	if	they	have	n't	fixed	cars	,	have	n't	done	stuff	with	their	hands	early	in	life	,	played	with	their	hands	,	they	ca	n't	problem-solve	as	well	.
So	play	is	practical	,	and	it	's	very	important	.
Now	one	of	the	things	about	play	is	that	it	is	born	by	curiosity	and	exploration	.
But	it	has	to	be	safe	exploration	.
This	happens	to	be	OK	--	he	's	an	anatomically	interested	little	boy	and	that	's	his	mom	.	Other	situations	would	n't	be	quite	so	good	.
But	curiosity	,	exploration	,	are	part	of	the	play	scene	.
If	you	want	to	belong	,	you	need	social	play	.
And	social	play	is	part	of	what	we	're	about	here	today	,	and	is	a	byproduct	of	the	play	scene	.
Rough	and	tumble	play	.
These	lionesses	,	seen	from	a	distance	,	looked	like	they	were	fighting	.
But	if	you	look	closely	,	they	're	kind	of	like	the	polar	bear	and	husky	:	no	claws	,	flat	fur	,	soft	eyes	,	open	mouth	with	no	fangs	,	balletic	movements	,	curvilinear	movements	--	all	specific	to	play	.
And	rough-and-tumble	play	is	a	great	learning	medium	for	all	of	us	.
Preschool	kids	,	for	example	,	should	be	allowed	to	dive	,	hit	,	whistle	,	scream	,	be	chaotic	,	and	develop	through	that	a	lot	of	emotional	regulation	and	a	lot	of	the	other	social	byproducts	--	cognitive	,	emotional	and	physical	--	that	come	as	a	part	of	rough	and	tumble	play	.
Spectator	play	,	ritual	play	--	we	're	involved	in	some	of	that	.
Those	of	you	who	are	from	Boston	know	that	this	was	the	moment	--	rare	--	where	the	Red	Sox	won	the	World	Series	.
But	take	a	look	at	the	face	and	the	body	language	of	everybody	in	this	fuzzy	picture	,	and	you	can	get	a	sense	that	they	're	all	at	play	.
Imaginative	play	.
I	love	this	picture	because	my	daughter	,	who	's	now	almost	40	,	is	in	this	picture	,	but	it	reminds	me	of	her	storytelling	and	her	imagination	,	her	ability	to	spin	yarns	at	this	age	--	preschool	.
A	really	important	part	of	being	a	player	is	imaginative	solo	play	.
And	I	love	this	one	,	because	it	's	also	what	we	're	about	.
We	all	have	an	internal	narrative	that	's	our	own	inner	story	.
The	unit	of	intelligibility	of	most	of	our	brains	is	the	story	.
I	'm	telling	you	a	story	today	about	play	.
Well	,	this	bushman	,	I	think	,	is	talking	about	the	fish	that	got	away	that	was	that	long	,	but	it	's	a	fundamental	part	of	the	play	scene	.
So	what	does	play	do	for	the	brain	?
Well	,	a	lot	.
We	do	n't	know	a	whole	lot	about	what	it	does	for	the	human	brain	,	because	funding	has	not	been	exactly	heavy	for	research	on	play	.
I	walked	into	the	Carnegie	asking	for	a	grant	.
They	'd	given	me	a	large	grant	when	I	was	an	academician	for	the	study	of	felony	drunken	drivers	,	and	I	thought	I	had	a	pretty	good	track	record	,
and	by	the	time	I	had	spent	half	an	hour	talking	about	play	,	it	was	obvious	that	they	were	not	--	did	not	feel	that	play	was	serious	.
I	think	that	--	that	's	a	few	years	back	--	I	think	that	wave	is	past	,	and	the	play	wave	is	cresting	,	because	there	is	some	good	science	.
Nothing	lights	up	the	brain	like	play	.
Three-dimensional	play	fires	up	the	cerebellum	,	puts	a	lot	of	impulses	into	the	frontal	lobe	--	the	executive	portion	--	helps	contextual	memory	be	developed	,	and	--	and	,	and	,	and	.
So	it	's	--	for	me	,	its	been	an	extremely	nourishing	scholarly	adventure	to	look	at	the	neuroscience	that	's	associated	with	play	,	and	to	bring	together	people	who	in	their	individual	disciplines	had	n't	really	thought	of	it	that	way	.
And	that	's	part	of	what	the	National	Institute	for	Play	is	all	about	.
And	this	is	one	of	the	ways	you	can	study	play	--	is	to	get	a	256-lead	electroencephalogram	.
I	'm	sorry	I	do	n't	have	a	playful-looking	subject	,	but	it	allows	mobility	,	which	has	limited	the	actual	study	of	play	.
And	we	've	got	a	mother-infant	play	scenario	that	we	're	hoping	to	complete	underway	at	the	moment	.
The	reason	I	put	this	here	is	also	to	queue	up	my	thoughts	about	objectifying	what	play	does	.
The	animal	world	has	objectified	it	.
In	the	animal	world	,	if	you	take	rats	,	who	are	hardwired	to	play	at	a	certain	period	of	their	juvenile	years	and	you	suppress	play	--	they	squeak	,	they	wrestle	,	they	pin	each	other	,	that	's	part	of	their	play	.
If	you	stop	that	behavior	on	one	group	that	you	're	experimenting	with	,	and	you	allow	it	in	another	group	that	you	're	experimenting	with	,	and	then	you	present	those	rats	with	a	cat	odor-saturated	collar	,	they	're	hardwired	to	flee	and	hide	.
Pretty	smart	--	they	do	n't	want	to	get	killed	by	a	cat	.
So	what	happens	?
They	both	hide	out	.
The	non-players	never	come	out	--	they	die	.
The	players	slowly	explore	the	environment	,	and	begin	again	to	test	things	out	.
That	says	to	me	,	at	least	in	rats	--	and	I	think	they	have	the	same	neurotransmitters	that	we	do	and	a	similar	cortical	architecture	--	that	play	may	be	pretty	important	for	our	survival	.
And	,	and	,	and	--	there	are	a	lot	more	animal	studies	that	I	could	talk	about	.
Now	,	this	is	a	consequence	of	play	deprivation	.
This	took	a	long	time	--	I	had	to	get	Homer	down	and	put	him	through	the	fMRI	and	the	SPECT	and	multiple	EEGs	,	but	as	a	couch	potato	,	his	brain	has	shrunk	.
And	we	do	know	that	in	domestic	animals	and	others	,	when	they	're	play	deprived	,	they	do	n't	--	and	rats	also	--	they	do	n't	develop	a	brain	that	is	normal	.
Now	,	the	program	says	that	the	opposite	of	play	is	not	work	,	it	's	depression	.
And	I	think	if	you	think	about	life	without	play	--	no	humor	,	no	flirtation	,	no	movies	,	no	games	,	no	fantasy	and	,	and	,	and	.
Try	and	imagine	a	culture	or	a	life	,	adult	or	otherwise	without	play	.
And	the	thing	that	's	so	unique	about	our	species	is	that	we	're	really	designed	to	play	through	our	whole	lifetime	.
And	we	all	have	capacity	to	play	signal	.
Nobody	misses	that	dog	I	took	a	picture	of	on	a	Carmel	beach	a	couple	of	weeks	ago	.
What	's	going	to	follow	from	that	behavior	is	play	.
And	you	can	trust	it	.
The	basis	of	human	trust	is	established	through	play	signals	.
And	we	begin	to	lose	those	signals	,	culturally	and	otherwise	,	as	adults	.
That	's	a	shame	.
I	think	we	've	got	a	lot	of	learning	to	do	.
Now	,	Jane	Goodall	has	here	a	play	face	along	with	one	of	her	favorite	chimps	.
So	part	of	the	signaling	system	of	play	has	to	do	with	vocal	,	facial	,	body	,	gestural	.
You	know	,	you	can	tell	--	and	I	think	when	we	're	getting	into	collective	play	,	its	really	important	for	groups	to	gain	a	sense	of	safety	through	their	own	sharing	of	play	signals	.
You	may	not	know	this	word	,
but	it	should	be	your	biological	first	name	and	last	name	.
Because	neoteny	means	the	retention	of	immature	qualities	into	adulthood	.
And	we	are	,	by	physical	anthropologists	,	by	many	,	many	studies	,	the	most	neotenous	,	the	most	youthful	,	the	most	flexible	,	the	most	plastic	of	all	creatures	.
And	therefore	,	the	most	playful	.
And	this	gives	us	a	leg	up	on	adaptability	.
Now	,	there	is	a	way	of	looking	at	play	that	I	also	want	to	emphasize	here	,	which	is	the	play	history	.
Your	own	personal	play	history	is	unique	,	and	often	is	not	something	we	think	about	particularly	.
This	is	a	book	written	by	a	consummate	player	by	the	name	of	Kevin	Carroll	.
Kevin	Carroll	came	from	extremely	deprived	circumstances	:	alcoholic	mother	,	absent	father	,	inner-city	Philadelphia	,	black	,	had	to	take	care	of	a	younger	brother	.
Found	that	when	he	looked	at	a	playground	out	of	a	window	into	which	he	had	been	confined	,	he	felt	something	different	.
And	so	he	followed	up	on	it	.
And	his	life	--	the	transformation	of	his	life	from	deprivation	and	what	one	would	expect	--	potentially	prison	or	death	--	he	become	a	linguist	,	a	trainer	for	the	76ers	and	now	is	a	motivational	speaker	.
And	he	gives	play	as	a	transformative	force	over	his	entire	life	.
Now	there	's	another	play	history	that	I	think	is	a	work	in	progress	.
Those	of	you	who	remember	Al	Gore	,	during	the	first	term	and	then	during	his	successful	but	unelected	run	for	the	presidency	,	may	remember	him	as	being	kind	of	wooden	and	not	entirely	his	own	person	,
at	least	in	public	.
And	looking	at	his	history	,	which	is	common	in	the	press	,	it	seems	to	me	,	at	least	--	looking	at	it	from	a	shrink	's	point	of	view	--	that	a	lot	of	his	life	was	programmed	.
Summers	were	hard	,	hard	work	,	in	the	heat	of	Tennessee	summers	.
He	had	the	expectations	of	his	senatorial	father	and	Washington	,	D.C	.
And	although	I	think	he	certainly	had	the	capacity	for	play	--	because	I	do	know	something	about	that	--	he	was	n't	as	empowered	,	I	think	,	as	he	now	is	by	paying	attention	to	what	is	his	own	passion	and	his	own	inner	drive	,	which	I	think	has	its	basis	in	all	of	us	in	our	play	history	.
So	what	I	would	encourage	on	an	individual	level	to	do	,	is	to	explore	backwards	as	far	as	you	can	go	to	the	most	clear	,	joyful	,	playful	image	that	you	have	,
whether	it	's	with	a	toy	,	on	a	birthday	or	on	a	vacation	.
And	begin	to	build	to	build	from	the	emotion	of	that	into	how	that	connects	with	your	life	now	.
And	you	'll	find	,	you	may	change	jobs	--	which	has	happened	to	a	number	people	when	I	've	had	them	do	this	--	in	order	to	be	more	empowered	through	their	play	.
Or	you	'll	be	able	to	enrich	your	life	by	prioritizing	it	and	paying	attention	to	it	.
Most	of	us	work	with	groups	,	and	I	put	this	up	because	the	d.school	,	the	design	school	at	Stanford	,	thanks	to	David	Kelley	and	a	lot	of	others	who	have	been	visionary	about	its	establishment	,	has	allowed	a	group	of	us	to	get	together	and	create	a	course	called	``	From	Play	to	Innovation	.	''	And	you	'll	see	this	course	is	to	investigate	the	human	state	of	play	,	which	is	kind	of	like	the	polar	bear-husky	state	and	its	importance	to	creative	thinking	:
``	to	explore	play	behavior	,	its	development	and	its	biological	basis	;
to	apply	those	principles	,	through	design	thinking	,	to	promote	innovation	in	the	corporate	world	;
and	the	students	will	work	with	real-world	partners	on	design	projects	with	widespread	application	.	''
This	is	our	maiden	voyage	in	this	.
We	're	about	two	and	a	half	,	three	months	into	it	,	and	it	's	really	been	fun	.
There	is	our	star	pupil	,	this	labrador	,	who	taught	a	lot	of	us	what	a	state	of	play	is	,	and	an	extremely	aged	and	decrepit	professor	in	charge	there	.
And	Brendan	Boyle	,	Rich	Crandall	--	and	on	the	far	right	is	,	I	think	,	a	person	who	will	be	in	cahoots	with	George	Smoot	for	a	Nobel	Prize	--	Stuart	Thompson	,	in	neuroscience	.
So	we	've	had	Brendan	,	who	's	from	IDEO	,	and	the	rest	of	us	sitting	aside	and	watching	these	students	as	they	put	play	principles	into	practice	in	the	classroom	.
And	one	of	their	projects	was	to	see	what	makes	meetings	boring	,	and	to	try	and	do	something	about	it	.
So	what	will	follow	is	a	student-made	film	about	just	that	.
Narrator	:	Flow	is	the	mental	state	of	apparition	in	which	the	person	is	fully	immersed	in	what	he	or	she	is	doing	.
Characterized	by	a	feeling	of	energized	focus	,	full	involvement	and	success	in	the	process	of	the	activity	.
An	important	key	insight	that	we	learned	about	meetings	is	that	people	pack	them	in	one	after	another	,	disruptive	to	the	day	.
Attendees	at	meetings	do	n't	know	when	they	'll	get	back	to	the	task	that	they	left	at	their	desk	.
But	it	does	n't	have	to	be	that	way	.
Some	sage	and	repeatedly	furry	monks	at	this	place	called	the	d.school	designed	a	meeting	that	you	can	literally	step	out	of	when	it	's	over	.
Take	the	meeting	off	,	and	have	peace	of	mind	that	you	can	come	back	to	me	.
Because	when	you	need	it	again	,	the	meeting	is	literally	hanging	in	your	closet	.
The	Wearable	Meeting	.
Because	when	you	put	it	on	,	you	immediately	get	everything	you	need	to	have	a	fun	and	productive	and	useful	meeting	.
But	when	you	take	it	off	--
that	's	when	the	real	action	happens	.
Stuart	Brown	:	So	I	would	encourage	you	all	to	engage	not	in	the	work-play	differential	--	where	you	set	aside	time	to	play	--	but	where	your	life	becomes	infused	minute	by	minute	,	hour	by	hour	,	with	body	,	object	,	social	,	fantasy	,	transformational	kinds	of	play	.
And	I	think	you	'll	have	a	better	and	more	empowered	life	.
Thank	You	.
John	Hockenberry	:	So	it	sounds	to	me	like	what	you	're	saying	is	that	there	may	be	some	temptation	on	the	part	of	people	to	look	at	your	work	and	go	--	I	think	I	've	heard	this	,	in	my	kind	of	pop	psychological	understanding	of	play	,	that	somehow	,	the	way	animals	and	humans	deal	with	play	,	is	that	it	's	some	sort	of	rehearsal	for	adult	activity	.
Your	work	seems	to	suggest	that	that	is	powerfully	wrong	.
SB	:	Yeah	,	I	do	n't	think	that	's	accurate	,	and	I	think	probably	because	animals	have	taught	us	that	.
If	you	stop	a	cat	from	playing	--	which	you	can	do	,	and	we	've	all	seen	how	cats	bat	around	stuff	--	they	're	just	as	good	predators	as	they	would	be	if	they	had	n't	played	.
And	if	you	imagine	a	kid	pretending	to	be	King	Kong	,	or	a	race	car	driver	,	or	a	fireman	,	they	do	n't	all	become	race	car	drivers	or	firemen	,	you	know	.
So	there	's	a	disconnect	between	preparation	for	the	future	--	which	is	what	most	people	are	comfortable	in	thinking	about	play	as	--	and	thinking	of	it	as	a	separate	biological	entity	.
And	this	is	where	my	chasing	animals	for	four	,	five	years	really	changed	my	perspective	from	a	clinician	to	what	I	am	now	,	which	is	that	play	has	a	biological	place	,	just	like	sleep	and	dreams	do	.
And	if	you	look	at	sleep	and	dreams	biologically	,	animals	sleep	and	dream	,	and	they	rehearse	and	they	do	some	other	things	that	help	memory	and	that	are	a	very	important	part	of	sleep	and	dreams	.
The	next	step	of	evolution	in	mammals	and	creatures	with	divinely	superfluous	neurons	will	be	to	play	.
And	the	fact	that	the	polar	bear	and	husky	or	magpie	and	a	bear	or	you	and	I	and	our	dogs	can	crossover	and	have	that	experience	sets	play	aside	as	something	separate	.
And	its	hugely	important	in	learning	and	crafting	the	brain	.
So	it	's	not	just	something	you	do	in	your	spare	time	.
JH	:	How	do	you	keep	--	and	I	know	you	're	part	of	the	scientific	research	community	,	and	you	have	to	justify	your	existence	with	grants	and	proposals	like	everyone	else	--	how	do	you	prevent	--	and	some	of	the	data	that	you	've	produced	,	the	good	science	that	you	're	talking	about	you	've	produced	,	is	hot	to	handle	.
How	do	you	prevent	either	the	media	's	interpretation	of	your	work	or	the	scientific	community	's	interpretation	of	the	implications	of	your	work	,	kind	of	like	the	Mozart	metaphor	,	where	,	``	Oh	,	MRIs	show
that	play	enhances	your	intelligence	.
Well	,	let	's	round	these	kids	up	,	put	them	in	pens	and	make	them	play	for	months	at	a	time	;	they	'll	all	be	geniuses	and	go	to	Harvard	.	''
How	do	you	prevent	people	from	taking	that	sort	of	action	on	the	data	that	you	're	developing	?
SB	:	Well	,	I	think	the	only	way	I	know	to	do	it	is	to	have	accumulated	the	advisers	that	I	have	who	go	from	practitioners	--	who	can	establish	through	improvisational	play	or	clowning	or	whatever	--	a	state	of	play	.
So	people	know	that	it	's	there	.
And	then	you	get	an	fMRI	specialist	,	and	you	get	Frank	Wilson	,	and	you	get	other	kinds	of	hard	scientists	,	including	neuroendocrinologists	.
And	you	get	them	into	a	group	together	focused	on	play	,	and	it	's	pretty	hard	not	to	take	it	seriously	.
Unfortunately	,	that	has	n't	been	done	sufficiently	for	the	National	Science	Foundation	,	National	Institute	of	Mental	Health	or	anybody	else	to	really	look	at	it	in	this	way	seriously	.
I	mean	you	do	n't	hear	about	anything	that	's	like	cancer	or	heart	disease	associated	with	play	.
And	yet	I	see	it	as	something	that	's	just	as	basic	for	survival	--	long	term	--	as	learning	some	of	the	basic	things	about	public	health	.
JH	:	Stuart	Brown	,	thank	you	very	much	.
Ben	Roche	:	So	I	'm	Ben	,	by	the	way	.	Homaro	Cantu	:	And	I	'm	Homaro	.
BR	:	And	we	're	chefs	.	So	when	Moto	opened	in	2004	,	people	did	n't	really	know	what	to	expect	.	A	lot	of	people	thought	that	it	was	a	Japanese	restaurant	,	and	maybe	it	was	the	name	,	maybe	it	was	the	logo	,	which	was	like	a	Japanese	character	,	but	anyway	,	we	had	all	these	requests	for	Japanese	food	,	which	is	really	not	what	we	did	.	And	after	about	the	ten	thousandth	request	for	a	maki	roll	,	we	decided	to	give	the	people	what	they	wanted	.	So	this	picture	is	an	example	of	printed	food	,	and	this	was	the	first	foray	into	what	we	like	to	call	flavor	transformation	.	So	this	is	all	the	ingredients	,	all	the	flavor	of	,	you	know	,	a	standard	maki	roll	,	printed	onto	a	little	piece	of	paper	.
HC	:	So	our	diners	started	to	get	bored	with	this	idea	,	and	we	decided	to	give	them	the	same	course	twice	,	so	here	we	actually	took	an	element	from	the	maki	roll	and	and	took	a	picture	of	a	dish	and	then	basically	served	that	picture	with	the	dish	.
So	this	dish	in	particular	is	basically	champagne	with	seafood	.
The	champagne	grapes	that	you	see	are	actually	carbonated	grapes	.	A	little	bit	of	seafood	and	some	crème	fraiche	and	the	picture	actually	tastes	exactly	like	the	dish	.
BR	:	But	it	's	not	all	just	edible	pictures	.
We	decided	to	do	something	a	little	bit	different	and	transform	flavors	that	were	very	familiar	--	so	in	this	case	,	we	have	carrot	cake	.
So	we	take	a	carrot	cake	,	put	it	in	a	blender	,	and	we	have	kind	of	like	a	carrot	cake	juice	,	and	then	that	went	into	a	balloon	frozen	in	liquid	nitrogen	to	create	this	hollow	shell	of	carrot	cake	ice	cream	,	I	guess	,	and	it	comes	off	looking	like	,	you	know	,	Jupiter	's	floating	around	your	plate	.
So	yeah	,	we	're	transforming	things	into	something	that	you	have	absolutely	no	reference	for	.
HC	:	And	here	's	something	we	have	no	reference	to	eat	.	This	is	a	cigar	,	and	basically	it	's	a	Cuban	cigar	made	out	of	a	Cuban	pork	sandwich	,	so	we	take	these	spices	that	go	into	the	pork	shoulder	,	we	fashion	that	into	ash	.	We	take
the	sandwich	and	wrap	it	up	in	a	collard	green	,	put	an	edible	label	that	bears	no	similarity	to	a	Cohiba	cigar	label	,	and	we	put	it	in	a	dollar	ninety-nine	ashtray	and	charge	you	about	twenty	bucks	for	it	.
HC	:	Delicious	.
BR	:	That	's	not	it	,	though	.
Instead	of	making	foods	that	look	like	things	that	you	would	n't	eat	,	we	decided	to	make	ingredients	look	like	dishes	that	you	know	.
So	this	is	a	plate	of	nachos	.
The	difference	between	our	nachos	and	the	other	guy	's	nachos	,	is	that	this	is	actually	a	dessert	.
So	the	chips	are	candied	,	the	ground	beef	is	made	from	chocolate	,	and	the	cheese	is	made	from	a	shredded	mango	sorbet	that	gets	shredded	into	liquid	nitrogen	to	look	like	cheese	.
And	after	doing	all	of	this	dematerialization	and	reconfiguring	of	this	,	of	these	ingredients	,	we	realized	that	it	was	pretty	cool	,	because	as	we	served	it	,	we	learned	that	the	dish	actually	behaves	like	the	real	thing	,	where	the	cheese	begins	to	melt	.
So	when	you	're	looking	at	this	thing	in	the	dining	room	,	you	have	this	sensation	that	this	is	actually	a	plate	of	nachos	,	and	it	's	not	really	until	you	begin	tasting	it	that	you	realize	this	is	a	dessert	,	and	it	's	just	kind	of	like	a	mind-ripper	.
HC	:	So	we	had	been	creating	all	of	these	dishes	out	of	a	kitchen	that	was	more	like	a	mechanic	's	shop	than	a	kitchen	,	and	the	next	logical	step	for	us	was	to	install	a	state-of-the-art	laboratory	,	and	that	's	what	we	have	here	.
So	we	put	this	in	the	basement	,	and	we	got	really	serious	about	food	,	like	serious	experimentation	.
BR	:	One	of	the	really	cool	things	about	the	lab	,	besides	that	we	have	a	new	science	lab	in	the	kitchen	,	is	that	,	you	know	,	with	this	new	equipment	,	and	this	new	approach	,	all	these	different	doors	to	creativity	that	we	never	knew	were	there	began	to	open	,	and	so	the	experiments	and	the	food	and	the	dishes	that	we	created	,	they	just	kept	going	further	and	further	out	there	.
HC	:	Let	's	talk	about	flavor	transformation	,	and	let	's	actually	make	some	cool	stuff	.
You	see	a	cow	with	its	tongue	hanging	out	.
What	I	see	is	a	cow	about	to	eat	something	delicious	.	What	is	that	cow	eating	?
And	why	is	it	delicious	?
So	the	cow	,	basically	,	eats	three	basic	things	in	their	feed	:	corn	,	beets	,	and	barley	,	and	so	what	I	do	is	I	actually	challenge	my	staff	with	these	crazy	,	wild	ideas	.	Can	we	take	what	the	cow	eats	,	remove	the	cow	,	and	then	make	some	hamburgers	out	of	that	?
And	basically	the	reaction	tends	to	be	kind	of	like	this	.
BR	:	Yeah	,	that	's	our	chef	de	cuisine	,	Chris	Jones	.	This	is	not	the	only	guy	that	just	flips	out	when	we	assign	a	ridiculous	task	,	but	a	lot	of	these	ideas	,	they	're	hard	to	understand	.
They	're	hard	to	just	get	automatically	.
There	's	a	lot	of	research	and	a	lot	of	failure	,	trial	and	error	--	I	guess	,	more	error	--	that	goes	into	each	and	every	dish	,	so	we	do	n't	always	get	it	right	,	and	it	takes	a	while	for	us	to	be	able	to	explain	that	to	people	.
HC	:	So	,	after	about	a	day	of	Chris	and	I	staring	at	each	other	,	we	came	up	with	something	that	was	pretty	close	to	the	hamburger	patty	,	and	as	you	can	see	it	basically	forms	like	hamburger	meat	.
This	is	made	from	three	ingredients	:	beets	,	barley	,	corn	,	and	so	it	actually	cooks	up	like	hamburger	meat	,	looks	and	tastes	like	hamburger	meat	,	and	not	only	that	,	but	it	's	basically	removing	the	cow	from	the	equation	.
So	replicating	food	,	taking	it	into	that	next	level	is	where	we	're	going	.
BR	:	And	it	's	definitely	the	world	's	first	bleeding	veggie	burger	,	which	is	a	cool	side	effect	.
And	a	miracle	berry	,	if	you	're	not	familiar	with	it	,	is	a	natural	ingredient	,	and	it	contains	a	special	property	.
It	's	a	glycoprotein	called	miraculin	,	a	naturally	occurring	thing	.	It	still	freaks	me	out	every	time	I	eat	it	,	but	it	has	a	unique	ability	to	mask	certain	taste	receptors	on	your	tongue	,	so	that	primarily	sour	taste	receptors	,	so	normally	things	that	would	taste	very	sour	or	tart	,	somehow	begin	to	taste	very	sweet	.
HC	:	You	're	about	to	eat	a	lemon	,	and	now	it	tastes	like	lemonade	.
Let	's	just	stop	and	think	about	the	economic	benefits	of	something	like	that	.
We	could	eliminate	sugar	across	the	board	for	all	confectionary	products	and	sodas	,	and	we	can	replace	it	with	all-natural	fresh	fruit	.
BR	:	So	you	see	us	here	cutting	up	some	watermelon	.	The	idea	with	this	is	that	we	're	going	to	eliminate	tons	of	food	miles	,	wasted	energy	,	and	overfishing	of	tuna	by	creating	tuna	,	or	any	exotic	produce	or	item	from	a	very	far-away	place	,	with	local	,	organic	produce	;	so	we	have	a	watermelon	from	Wisconsin	.
HC	:	So	if	miracle	berries	take	sour	things	and	turn	them	into	sweet	things	,	we	have	this	other	pixie	dust	that	we	put	on	the	watermelon	,	and	it	makes	it	go	from	sweet	to	savory	.
So	after	we	do	that	,	we	put	it	into	a	vacuum	bag	,	add	a	little	bit	of	seaweed	,	some	spices	,	and	we	roll	it	,	and	this	starts	taking	on	the	appearance	of	tuna	.
So	the	key	now	is	to	make	it	behave	like	tuna	.
BR	:	And	then	after	a	quick	dip	into	some	liquid	nitrogen	to	get	that	perfect	sear	,	we	really	have	something	that	looks	,	tastes	and	behaves	like	the	real	thing	.
HC	:	So	the	key	thing	to	remember	here	is	,	we	do	n't	really	care	what	this	tuna	really	is	.
As	long	as	it	's	good	for	you	and	good	for	the	environment	,	it	does	n't	matter	.
But	where	is	this	going	?
How	can	we	take	this	idea	of	tricking	your	tastebuds	and	leapfrog	it	into	something	that	we	can	do	today	that	could	be	a	disruptive	food	technology	?
So	here	's	the	next	challenge	.
I	told	the	staff	,	let	's	just	take	a	bunch	of	wild	plants	,	think	of	them	as	food	ingredients	.	As	long	as	they	're	non-poisonous	to	the	human	body	,	go	out	around	Chicago	sidewalks	,	take	it	,	blend	it	,	cook	it	and	then	have	everybody	flavor-trip	on	it	at	Moto	.
Let	's	charge	them	a	boatload	of	cash	for	this	and	see	what	they	think	.
BR	:	Yeah	,	so	you	can	imagine	,	a	task	like	this	--	this	is	another	one	of	those	assignments	that	the	kitchen	staff	hated	us	for	.	But	we	really	had	to	almost	relearn	how	to	cook	in	general	,	because	these	are	ingredients	,	you	know	,	plant	life	that	we	're	,	one	,	unfamiliar	with	,	and	two	,	we	have	no	reference	for	how	to	cook	these	things	because	people	do	n't	eat	them	.
So	we	really	had	to	think	about	new	,	creative	ways	to	flavor	,	new	ways	to	cook	and	to	change	texture	--	and	that	was	the	main	issue	with	this	challenge	.
HC	:	So	this	is	where	we	step	into	the	future	and	we	leapfrog	ahead	.
So	developing	nations	and	first-world	nations	,	imagine	if	you	could	take	these	wild	plants	and	consume	them	,	food	miles	would	basically	turn	into	food	feet	.
This	disruptive	mentality	of	what	food	is	would	essentially	open	up	the	encyclopedia	of	what	raw	ingredients	are	,	even	if	we	just	swapped	out	,	say	,	one	of	these	for	flour	,	that	would	eliminate	so	much	energy	and	so	much	waste	.
And	to	give	you	a	simple	example	here	as	to	what	we	actually	fed	these	customers	,	there	's	a	bale	of	hay	there	and	some	crab	apples	.
And	basically	we	took	hay	and	crab	apples	and	made	barbecue	sauce	out	of	those	two	ingredients	.
People	swore	they	were	eating	barbecue	sauce	,	and	this	is	free	food	.
BR	:	Thanks	,	guys	.
How	does	the	news	shape	the	way	we	see	the	world	?
Here	's	the	world	based	on	the	way	it	looks	--	based	on	landmass	.
And	here	's	how	news	shapes	what	Americans	see	.
This	map	--	--	this	map	shows	the	number	of	seconds	that	American	network	and	cable	news	organizations	dedicated	to	news	stories	,	by	country	,	in	February	of	2007	--	just	one	year	ago	.
Now	,	this	was	a	month	when	North	Korea	agreed	to	dismantle	its	nuclear	facilities	.
There	was	massive	flooding	in	Indonesia	.
And	in	Paris	,	the	IPCC	released	its	study	confirming	man	's	impact	on	global	warming	.
The	U.S.	accounted	for	79	percent	of	total	news	coverage	.
And	when	we	take	out	the	U.S.	and	look	at	the	remaining	21	percent	,	we	see	a	lot	of	Iraq	--	that	's	that	big	green	thing	there	--	and	little	else	.
The	combined	coverage	of	Russia	,	China	and	India	,	for	example	,	reached	just	one	percent	.
When	we	analyzed	all	the	news	stories	and	removed	just	one	story	,	here	's	how	the	world	looked	.
What	was	that	story	?	The	death	of	Anna	Nicole	Smith	.
This	story	eclipsed	every	country	except	Iraq	,	and	received	10	times	the	coverage	of	the	IPCC	report	.
And	the	cycle	continues	;	as	we	all	know	,	Britney	has	loomed	pretty	large	lately	.
So	,	why	do	n't	we	hear	more	about	the	world	?
One	reason	is	that	news	networks	have	reduced	the	number	of	their	foreign	bureaus	by	half	.
Aside	from	one-person	ABC	mini-bureaus	in	Nairobi	,	New	Delhi	and	Mumbai	,	there	are	no	network	news	bureaus	in	all	of	Africa	,	India	or	South	America	--	places	that	are	home	to	more	than	two	billion	people	.
The	reality	is	that	covering	Britney	is	cheaper	.
And	this	lack	of	global	coverage	is	all	the	more	disturbing	when	we	see	where	people	go	for	news	.
Local	TV	news	looms	large	,	and	unfortunately	only	dedicates	12	percent	of	its	coverage	to	international	news	.
And	what	about	the	web	?
The	most	popular	news	sites	do	n't	do	much	better	.
Last	year	,	Pew	and	the	Colombia	J-School	analyzed	the	14,000	stories	that	appeared	on	Google	News	'	front	page	.
And	they	,	in	fact	,	covered	the	same	24	news	events	.
Similarly	,	a	study	in	e-content	showed	that	much	of	global	news	from	U.S.	news	creators	is	recycled	stories	from	the	AP	wire	services	and	Reuters	,	and	do	n't	put	things	into	a	context	that	people	can	understand	their	connection	to	it	.
So	,	if	you	put	it	all	together	,	this	could	help	explain	why	today	's	college	graduates	,	as	well	as	less	educated	Americans	,	know	less	about	the	world	than	their	counterparts	did	20	years	ago	.
And	if	you	think	it	's	simply	because	we	are	not	interested	,	you	would	be	wrong	.
In	recent	years	,	Americans	who	say	they	closely	follow	global	news	most	of	the	time	grew	to	over	50	percent	.
The	real	question	:	is	this	distorted	worldview	what	we	want	for	Americans	in	our	increasingly	interconnected	world	?
I	know	we	can	do	better	.
And	can	we	afford	not	to	?	Thank	you	.
When	most	people	think	about	the	beginnings	of	AIDS	,	they	're	gon	na	think	back	to	the	1980s	.
And	certainly	,	this	was	the	decade	in	which	we	discovered	AIDS	and	the	virus	that	causes	it	,	HIV	.
But	in	fact	this	virus	crossed	over	into	humans	many	decades	before	,	from	chimpanzees	,	where	the	virus	originated	,	into	humans	who	hunt	these	apes	.
This	photo	was	taken	before	the	Great	Depression	in	Brazzaville	,	Congo	.
At	this	time	,	there	were	thousands	of	individuals	,	we	think	,	that	were	infected	with	HIV	.
So	I	have	a	couple	of	really	important	questions	for	you	.
If	this	virus	was	in	thousands	of	individuals	at	this	point	,	why	was	it	the	case	that	it	took	us	until	1984	to	be	able	to	discover	this	virus	?
OK	now	,	more	importantly	,	had	we	been	there	in	the	'40s	and	'50s	,	'60s	,	had	we	seen	this	disease	,	had	we	understood	exactly	what	was	going	on	with	it	,	how	might	that	have	changed	and	completely	transformed	the	nature	of	the	way	this	pandemic	moved	?
In	fact	,	this	is	not	unique	to	HIV	.	The	vast	majority	of	viruses	come	from	animals	.
And	you	can	kind	of	think	of	this	as	a	pyramid	of	this	bubbling	up	of	viruses	from	animals	into	human	populations	.
But	only	at	the	very	top	of	this	pyramid	do	these	things	become	completely	human	.
Nevertheless	,	we	spend	the	vast	majority	of	our	energy	focused	on	this	level	of	the	pyramid	,	trying	to	tackle	things	that	are	already	completely	adapted	to	human	beings	,	that	are	going	to	be	very	very	difficult	to	address	--	as	we	've	seen	in	the	case	of	HIV	.
So	during	the	last	15	years	,	I	've	been	working	to	actually	study	the	earlier	interface	here	--	what	I	've	labeled	``	viral	chatter	,	''	which	was	a	term	coined	by	my	mentor	Don	Burke	.
This	is	the	idea	that	we	can	study	the	sort	of	pinging	of	these	viruses	into	human	populations	,	the	movement	of	these	agents	over	into	humans	;	and	by	capturing	this	moment	,	we	might	be	able	to	move	to	a	situation	where	we	can	catch	them	early	.
OK	,	so	this	is	a	picture	,	and	I	'm	going	to	show	you	some	pictures	now	from	the	field	.
This	is	a	picture	of	a	central	African	hunter	.
It	's	actually	a	fairly	common	picture	.
One	of	the	things	I	want	you	to	note	from	it	is	blood	--	that	you	see	a	tremendous	amount	of	blood	contact	.
This	was	absolutely	key	for	us	.	This	is	a	very	intimate	form	of	connection	.
So	if	we	're	going	to	study	viral	chatter	,	we	need	to	get	to	these	populations	who	have	intensive	contact	with	wild	animals	.
And	so	we	've	been	studying	people	like	this	individual	.
We	collect	blood	from	them	,	other	specimens	.
We	look	at	the	diseases	,	which	are	in	the	animals	as	well	as	the	humans	.
And	ideally	,	this	is	going	to	allow	us	to	catch	these	things	early	on	,	as	they	're	moving	over	into	human	populations	.
And	the	basic	objective	of	this	work	is	not	to	just	go	out	once	and	look	at	these	individuals	,	but	to	establish	thousands	of	individuals	in	these	populations	that	we	would	monitor	continuously	on	a	regular	basis	.
When	they	were	sick	,	we	would	collect	specimens	from	them	.
We	would	actually	enlist	them	--	which	we	've	done	now	--	to	collect	specimens	from	animals	.
We	give	them	these	little	pieces	of	filter	paper	.
When	they	sample	from	animals	,	they	collect	the	blood	on	the	filter	paper	and	this	allows	us	to	identify	yet-unknown	viruses	from	exactly	the	right	animals	--	the	ones	that	are	actually	being	hunted	.
Narrator	:	Deep	in	a	remote	region	of	Cameroon	,	two	hunters	stalk	their	prey	.
Their	names	are	Patrice	and	Patee	.
They	're	searching	for	bush	meat	;	forest	animals	they	can	kill	to	feed	their	families	.
Patrice	and	Patee	set	out	most	days	to	go	out	hunting	in	the	forest	around	their	homes	.
They	have	a	series	of	traps	,	of	snares	that	they	've	set	up	to	catch	wild	pigs	,	snakes	,	monkeys	,	rodents	--	anything	they	can	,	really	.
Patrice	and	Patee	have	been	out	for	hours	but	found	nothing	.
The	animals	are	simply	gone	.
We	stop	for	a	drink	of	water	.
Then	there	is	a	rustle	in	the	brush	.
A	group	of	hunters	approach	,
their	packs	loaded	with	wild	game	.
There	's	at	least	three	viruses	that	you	know	about	,	which	are	in	this	particular	monkey	.
Nathan	Wolfe	:	This	species	,	yeah	.	And	there	's	many	many	more	pathogens	that	are	present	in	these	animals	.
These	individuals	are	at	specific	risk	,	particularly	if	there	's	blood	contact	,	they	're	at	risk	for	transmission	and	possibly	infection	with	novel	viruses	.
Narrator	:	As	the	hunters	display	their	kills	,	something	surprising	happens	.
They	show	us	filter	paper	they	've	used	to	collect	the	animals	'	blood	.
The	blood	will	be	tested	for	zoonotic	viruses	,	part	of	a	program	Dr.	Wolfe	has	spent	years	setting	up	.
NW	:	So	this	is	from	this	animal	right	here	,	Greater	Spot-Nosed	Guenon	.
Every	person	who	has	one	of	those	filter	papers	has	at	least	,	at	a	minimum	,	been	through	our	basic	health	education	about	the	risks	associated	with	these	activities	,	which	presumably	,	from	our	perspective	,	gives	them	the	ability	to	decrease	their	own	risk	,	and	then	obviously	the	risk	to	their	families	,	the	village	,	the	country	,	and	the	world	.
NW	:	OK	,	before	I	continue	,	I	think	it	's	important	to	take	just	a	moment	to	talk	about	bush	meat	.	Bush	meat	is	the	hunting	of	wild	game	.
OK	?	And	you	can	consider	all	sorts	of	different	bush	meat	.
I	'm	going	to	be	talking	about	this	.
When	your	children	and	grandchildren	sort	of	pose	questions	to	you	about	this	period	of	time	,	one	of	the	things	they	're	gon	na	ask	you	,	is	how	it	was	they	we	allowed	some	of	our	closest	living	relatives	,	some	of	the	most	valuable	and	endangered	species	on	our	planet	,	to	go	extinct	because	we	were	n't	able	to	address	some	of	the	issues	of	poverty	in	these	parts	of	the	world	.
But	in	fact	that	's	not	the	only	question	they	're	going	to	ask	you	about	this	.
They	're	also	going	to	ask	you	the	question	that	when	we	knew	that	this	was	the	way	that	HIV	entered	into	the	human	population	,	and	that	other	diseases	had	the	potential	to	enter	like	this	,	why	did	we	let	these	behaviors	continue	?
Why	did	we	not	find	some	other	solution	to	this	?
They	're	going	to	say	,	in	regions	of	profound	instability	throughout	the	world	,	where	you	have	intense	poverty	,	where	populations	are	growing	and	you	do	n't	have	sustainable	resources	like	this	,	this	is	going	to	lead	to	food	insecurity	.
But	they	're	also	going	to	ask	you	probably	a	different	question	.
It	's	one	that	I	think	we	all	need	to	ask	ourselves	,	which	is	,	why	we	thought	the	responsibility	rested	with	this	individual	here	.
Now	this	is	the	individual	--	you	can	see	just	right	up	over	his	right	shoulder	--	this	is	the	individual	that	hunted	the	monkey	from	the	last	picture	that	I	showed	you	.
OK	,	take	a	look	at	his	shirt	.
You	know	,	take	a	look	at	his	face	.
Bush	meat	is	one	of	the	central	crises	,	which	is	occurring	in	our	population	right	now	,	in	humanity	,	on	this	planet	.
But	it	ca	n't	be	the	fault	of	somebody	like	this	.
OK	?	And	solving	it	can	not	be	his	responsibility	alone	.
There	's	no	easy	solutions	,	but	what	I	'm	saying	to	you	is	that	we	neglect	this	problem	at	our	own	peril	.
So	,	in	1998	,	along	with	my	mentors	Don	Burke	and	Colonel	Mpoudi-Ngole	,	we	went	to	actually	start	this	work	in	Central	Africa	,	to	work	with	hunters	in	this	part	of	the	world	.
And	my	job	--	at	that	time	I	was	a	post-doctoral	fellow	,	and	I	was	really	tasked	with	setting	this	up	.
So	I	said	to	myself	,	``	OK	,	great	--	we	're	gon	na	collect	all	kinds	of	specimens	.	We	're	gon	na	go	to	all	these	different	locations	.	It	's	going	to	be	wonderful	.	''
You	know	,	I	looked	at	the	map	;	I	picked	out	17	sites	;	I	figured	,	no	problem	.
Needless	to	say	,	I	was	drastically	wrong	.	This	is	challenging	work	to	do	.
Fortunately	,	I	had	and	continue	to	have	an	absolutely	wonderful	team	of	colleagues	and	collaborators	in	my	own	team	,	and	that	's	the	only	way	that	this	work	can	really	occur	.
We	have	a	whole	range	of	challenges	about	this	work	.
One	of	them	is	just	obtaining	trust	from	individuals	that	we	work	with	in	the	field	.
The	person	you	see	on	the	right	hand	side	is	Paul	DeLong-Minutu	.
He	's	one	of	the	best	communicators	that	I	've	really	ever	dealt	with	.
When	I	arrived	I	did	n't	speak	a	word	of	French	,	and	I	still	seemed	to	understand	what	it	was	he	was	saying	.
Paul	worked	for	years	on	the	Cameroonian	national	radio	and	television	,	and	he	spoke	about	health	issues	.	He	was	a	health	correspondent	.
So	we	figured	we	'd	hire	this	person	--	when	we	got	there	he	could	be	a	great	communicator	.
When	we	would	get	to	these	rural	villages	,	though	,	what	we	found	out	is	that	no	one	had	television	,	so	they	would	n't	recognize	his	face	.
But	--	when	he	began	to	speak	they	would	actually	recognize	his	voice	from	the	radio	.
And	this	was	somebody	who	had	incredible	potential	to	spread	aspects	of	our	message	,	whether	it	be	with	regards	to	wildlife	conservation	or	health	prevention	.
Often	we	run	into	obstacles	.	This	is	us	coming	back	from	one	of	these	very	rural	sites	,	with	specimens	from	200	individuals	that	we	needed	to	get	back	to	the	lab	within	48	hours	.
I	like	to	show	this	shot	--	this	is	Ubald	Tamoufe	,	who	's	the	lead	investigator	in	our	Cameroon	site	.
Ubald	laughs	at	me	when	I	show	this	photo	because	of	course	you	ca	n't	see	his	face	.
But	the	reason	I	like	to	show	the	shot	is	because	you	can	see	that	he	's	about	to	solve	this	problem	.
Which	--	which	he	did	,	which	he	did	.
Just	a	few	quick	before	and	after	shots	.
This	was	our	laboratory	before	.
This	is	what	it	looks	like	now	.
Early	on	,	in	order	to	ship	our	specimens	,	we	had	to	have	dry	ice	.	To	get	dry	ice	we	had	to	go	to	the	breweries	--	beg	,	borrow	,	steal	to	get	these	folks	to	give	it	to	us	.
Now	we	have	our	own	liquid	nitrogen	.
I	like	to	call	our	laboratory	the	coldest	place	in	Central	Africa	--	it	might	be	.
And	here	's	a	shot	of	me	,	this	is	the	before	shot	of	me	.
No	comment	.
So	what	happened	?	So	during	the	10	years	that	we	've	been	doing	this	work	,	we	actually	surprised	ourselves	.
We	made	a	number	of	discoveries	.
And	what	we	've	found	is	that	if	you	look	in	the	right	place	,	you	can	actually	monitor	the	flow	of	these	viruses	into	human	populations	.
That	gave	us	a	tremendous	amount	of	hope	.
What	we	've	found	is	a	whole	range	of	new	viruses	in	these	individuals	,	including	new	viruses	in	the	same	group	as	HIV	--	so	,	brand	new	retroviruses	.
And	let	's	face	it	,	any	new	retrovirus	in	the	human	population	--	it	's	something	we	should	be	aware	of	.
It	's	something	we	should	be	following	.	It	's	not	something	that	we	should	be	surprised	by	.
Needless	to	say	in	the	past	these	viruses	entering	into	these	rural	communities	might	very	well	have	gone	extinct	.
That	's	no	longer	the	case	.	Logging	roads	provide	access	to	urban	areas	.
And	critically	,	what	happens	in	central	Africa	does	n't	stay	in	Central	Africa	.
So	,	once	we	discovered	that	it	was	really	possible	that	we	could	actually	do	this	monitoring	,	we	decided	to	move	this	from	research	,	to	really	attempt	to	phase	up	to	a	global	monitoring	effort	.
Through	generous	support	and	partnership	scientifically	with	Google.org	and	the	Skoll	Foundation	,	we	were	able	to	start	the	Global	Viral	Forecasting	Initiative	and	begin	work	in	four	different	sites	in	Africa	and	Asia	.
Needless	to	say	,	different	populations	from	different	parts	of	the	world	have	different	sorts	of	contact	.
So	it	's	not	just	hunters	in	Central	Africa	.
It	's	also	working	in	live	animal	markets	--	these	wet	markets	--	which	is	exactly	the	place	where	SARS	emerged	in	Asia	.
But	really	,	this	is	just	the	beginning	from	our	perspective	.
Our	objective	right	now	,	in	addition	to	deploying	to	these	sites	and	getting	everything	moving	,	is	to	identify	new	partners	because	we	feel	like	this	effort	needs	to	be	extended	to	probably	20	or	more	sites	throughout	the	world	--	to	viral	hotspots	--	because	really	the	idea	here	is	to	cast	an	incredibly	wide	net	so	that	we	can	catch	these	things	,	ideally	,	before	they	make	it	to	blood	banks	,	sexual	networks	,	airplanes	.	And	that	's	really	our	objective	.
There	was	a	time	not	very	long	ago	when	the	discovery	of	unknown	organisms	was	something	that	held	incredible	awe	for	us	.
It	had	potential	to	really	change	the	way	that	we	saw	ourselves	,	and	thought	about	ourselves	.
Many	people	,	I	think	,	on	our	planet	right	now	despair	,	and	they	think	we	've	reached	a	point	where	we	've	discovered	most	of	the	things	.
I	'm	going	tell	you	right	now	:	please	do	n't	despair	.
If	an	intelligent	extra-terrestrial	was	taxed	with	writing	the	encyclopedia	of	life	on	our	planet	,	27	out	of	30	of	these	volumes	would	be	devoted	to	bacteria	and	virus	,	with	just	a	few	of	the	volumes	left	for	plants	,	fungus	and	animals	,	humans	being	a	footnote	;	interesting	footnote	but	a	footnote	nonetheless	.
This	is	honestly	the	most	exciting	period	ever	for	the	study	of	unknown	life	forms	on	our	planet	.
The	dominant	things	that	exist	here	we	know	almost	nothing	about	.
And	yet	finally	,	we	have	the	tools	,	which	will	allow	us	to	actually	explore	that	world	and	understand	them	.
Thank	you	very	much	.
Hello	!	My	name	is	Golan	Levin	.
I	'm	an	artist	and	an	engineer	,
which	is	,	increasingly	,	a	more	common	kind	of	hybrid	.
But	I	still	fall	into	this	weird	crack	where	people	do	n't	seem	to	understand	me	.
And	I	was	looking	around	and	I	found	this	wonderful	picture	.
It	's	a	letter	from	``	Artforum	''	in	1967	saying	``	We	ca	n't	imagine	ever	doing	a	special	issue	on	electronics	or	computers	in	art	.	''	And	they	still	have	n't	.
And	lest	you	think	that	you	all	,	as	the	digerati	,	are	more	enlightened	,	I	went	to	the	Apple	iPhone	app	store	the	other	day	.
Where	's	art	?	I	got	productivity	.	I	got	sports	.
And	somehow	the	idea	that	one	would	want	to	make	art	for	the	iPhone	,	which	my	friends	and	I	are	doing	now	,	is	still	not	reflected	in	our	understanding	of	what	computers	are	for	.
So	,	from	both	directions	,	there	is	kind	of	,	I	think	,	a	lack	of	understanding	about	what	it	could	mean	to	be	an	artist	who	uses	the	materials	of	his	own	day	,	or	her	own	day	,
which	I	think	artists	are	obliged	to	do	,	is	to	really	explore	the	expressive	potential	of	the	new	tools	that	we	have	.
In	my	own	case	,	I	'm	an	artist	,	and	I	'm	really	interested	in	expanding	the	vocabulary	of	human	action	,	and	basically	empowering	people	through	interactivity	.
I	want	people	to	discover	themselves	as	actors	,	as	creative	actors	,	by	having	interactive	experiences	.
A	lot	of	my	work	is	about	trying	to	get	away	from	this	.
This	a	photograph	of	the	desktop	of	a	student	of	mine	.
And	when	I	say	desktop	,	I	do	n't	just	mean	the	actual	desk	where	his	mouse	has	worn	away	the	surface	of	the	desk	.
If	you	look	carefully	,	you	can	even	see	a	hint	of	the	Apple	menu	,	up	here	in	the	upper	left	,	where	the	virtual	world	has	literally	punched	through	to	the	physical	.
So	this	is	,	as	Joy	Mountford	once	said	,	``	The	mouse	is	probably	the	narrowest	straw	you	could	try	to	suck	all	of	human	expression	through	.	''
And	the	thing	I	'm	really	trying	to	do	is	enabling	people	to	have	more	rich	kinds	of	interactive	experiences	.
How	can	we	get	away	from	the	mouse	and	use	our	full	bodies	as	a	way	of	exploring	aesthetic	experiences	,	not	necessarily	utilitarian	ones	.
So	I	write	software	.	And	that	's	how	I	do	it	.
And	a	lot	of	my	experiences	resemble	mirrors	in	some	way	.
Because	this	is	,	in	some	sense	,	the	first	way	,	that	people	discover	their	own	potential	as	actors	,	and	discover	their	own	agency	.
By	saying	``	Who	is	that	person	in	the	mirror	?	Oh	it	's	actually	me	.	''
And	so	,	to	give	an	example	,	this	is	a	project	from	last	year	,
which	is	called	the	Interstitial	Fragment	Processor	.
And	it	allows	people	to	explore	the	negative	shapes	that	they	create	when	they	're	just	going	about	their	everyday	business	.
So	as	people	make	shapes	with	their	hands	or	their	heads	and	so	forth	,	or	with	each	other	,	these	shapes	literally	produce	sounds	and	drop	out	of	thin	air	--
basically	taking	what	's	often	this	,	kind	of	,	unseen	space	,	or	this	undetected	space	,	and	making	it	something	real	,	that	people	then	can	appreciate	and	become	creative	with	.
So	again	,	people	discover	their	creative	agency	in	this	way	.
And	their	own	personalities	come	out	in	totally	unique	ways	.
So	in	addition	to	using	full-body	input	,	something	that	I	've	explored	now	,	for	a	while	,	has	been	the	use	of	the	voice	,
which	is	an	immensely	expressive	system	for	us	,	vocalizing	.
Song	is	one	of	our	oldest	ways	of	making	ourselves	heard	and	understood	.
And	I	came	across	this	fantastic	research	by	Wolfgang	Köhler	,	the	so-called	father	of	gestalt	psychology	,	from	1927	,	who	submitted	to	an	audience	like	yourselves	the	following	two	shapes	.
And	he	said	one	of	them	is	called	Maluma	.
And	one	of	them	is	called	Taketa	.	Which	is	which	?
Anyone	want	to	hazard	a	guess	?
Maluma	is	on	top	.	Yeah	.	So	.
As	he	says	here	,	most	people	answer	without	any	hesitation	.
So	what	we	're	really	seeing	here	is	a	phenomenon	called	phonaesthesia	,
which	is	a	kind	of	synesthesia	that	all	of	you	have	.
And	so	,	whereas	Dr.	Oliver	Sacks	has	talked	about	how	perhaps	one	person	in	a	million	actually	has	true	synesthesia	,	where	they	hear	colors	or	taste	shapes	,	and	things	like	this	,
phonaesthesia	is	something	we	can	all	experience	to	some	extent	.
It	's	about	mappings	between	different	perceptual	domains	,	like	hardness	,	sharpness	,	brightness	and	darkness	,	and	the	phonemes	that	we	're	able	to	speak	with	.
So	70	years	on	,	there	's	been	some	research	where	cognitive	psychologists	have	actually	sussed	out	the	extent	to	which	,	you	know	,	L	,	M	and	B	are	more	associated	with	shapes	that	look	like	this	,
and	P	,	T	and	K	are	perhaps	more	associated	with	shapes	like	this	.
And	here	we	suddenly	begin	to	have	a	mapping	between	curvature	that	we	can	exploit	numerically	,	a	relative	mapping	between	curvature	and	shape	.
So	it	occurred	to	me	,	what	happens	if	we	could	run	these	backwards	?
And	thus	was	born	the	project	called	Remark	,
which	is	a	collaboration	with	Zachary	Lieberman	and	the	Ars	Electronica	Futurelab	.
And	this	is	an	interactive	installation	which	presents	the	fiction	that	speech	casts	visible	shadows	.
So	the	idea	is	you	step	into	a	kind	of	a	magic	light	.	And	as	you	do	,	you	see	the	shadows	of	your	own	speech	.
And	they	sort	of	fly	away	,	out	of	your	head	.
If	a	computer	speech	recognition	system	is	able	to	recognize	what	you	're	saying	,	then	it	spells	it	out	.
And	if	it	is	n't	then	it	produces	a	shape	which	is	very	phonaesthetically	tightly	coupled	to	the	sounds	you	made	.
So	let	's	bring	up	a	video	of	that	.
Thanks	.	So	.	And	this	project	here	,	I	was	working	with	the	great	abstract	vocalist	,	Jaap	Blonk	.
And	he	is	a	world	expert	in	performing	``	The	Ursonate	,	''	which	is	a	half-an-hour	nonsense	poem	by	Kurt	Schwitters	,	written	in	the	1920s	,
which	is	half	an	hour	of	very	highly	patterned	nonsense	.
And	it	's	almost	impossible	to	perform	.
But	Jaap	is	one	of	the	world	experts	in	performing	it	.
And	in	this	project	we	've	developed	a	form	of	intelligent	real-time	subtitles	.
So	these	are	our	live	subtitles	,	that	are	being	produced	by	a	computer	that	knows	the	text	of	``	The	Ursonate	''	--	fortunately	Jaap	does	too	,	very	well	--
and	it	is	delivering	that	text	at	the	same	time	as	Jaap	is	.
So	all	the	text	you	're	going	to	see	is	real-time	generated	by	the	computer	,	visualizing	what	he	's	doing	with	his	voice	.
Here	you	can	see	the	set-up	where	there	is	a	screen	with	the	subtitles	behind	him	.
Okay	.	So	...
The	full	videos	are	online	if	you	are	interested	.
I	got	a	split	reaction	to	that	during	the	live	performance	,
because	there	is	some	people	who	understand	live	subtitles	are	a	kind	of	an	oxymoron	,
because	usually	there	is	someone	making	them	afterwards	.
And	then	a	bunch	of	people	who	were	like	,	``	What	's	the	big	deal	?
I	see	subtitles	all	the	time	on	television	.	''
You	know	?	They	do	n't	imagine	the	person	in	the	booth	,	typing	it	all	.
So	in	addition	to	the	full	body	,	and	in	addition	to	the	voice	,	another	thing	that	I	've	been	really	interested	in	,	most	recently	,	is	the	use	of	the	eyes	,	or	the	gaze	,	in	terms	of	how	people	relate	to	each	other	.
It	's	a	really	profound	amount	of	nonverbal	information	that	's	communicated	with	the	eyes	.
And	it	's	one	of	the	most	interesting	technical	challenges	that	's	very	currently	active	in	the	computer	sciences	:
being	able	to	have	a	camera	that	can	understand	,	from	a	fairly	big	distance	away	,	how	these	little	tiny	balls	are	actually	pointing	in	one	way	or	another	to	reveal	what	you	're	interested	in	,	and	where	your	attention	is	directed	.
So	there	is	a	lot	of	emotional	communication	that	happens	there	.
And	so	I	've	been	beginning	,	with	a	variety	of	different	projects	,	to	understand	how	people	can	relate	to	machines	with	their	eyes	.
And	basically	to	ask	the	questions	:	What	if	art	was	aware	that	we	were	looking	at	it	?
How	could	it	respond	,	in	a	way	,	to	acknowledge	or	subvert	the	fact	that	we	're	looking	at	it	?
And	what	could	it	do	if	it	could	look	back	at	us	?
And	so	those	are	the	questions	that	are	happening	in	the	next	projects	.
In	the	first	one	which	I	'm	going	to	show	you	,	called	Eyecode	,	it	's	a	piece	of	interactive	software	in	which	,	if	we	read	this	little	circle	,	``	the	trace	left	by	the	looking	of	the	previous	observer	looks	at	the	trace	left	by	the	looking	of	previous	observer	.	''
The	idea	is	that	it	's	an	image	wholly	constructed	from	its	own	history	of	being	viewed	by	different	people	in	an	installation	.
So	let	me	just	switch	over	so	we	can	do	the	live	demo	.
So	let	's	run	this	and	see	if	it	works	.
Okay	.	Ah	,	there	is	lots	of	nice	bright	video	.
There	is	just	a	little	test	screen	that	shows	that	it	's	working	.
And	what	I	'm	just	going	to	do	is	--	I	'm	going	to	hide	that	.	And	you	can	see	here	that	what	it	's	doing	is	it	's	recording	my	eyes	every	time	I	blink	.
Hello	?	And	I	can	...	hello	...	okay	.
And	no	matter	where	I	am	,	what	's	really	going	on	here	is	that	it	's	an	eye-tracking	system	that	tries	to	locate	my	eyes	.
And	if	I	get	really	far	away	I	'm	blurry	.
You	know	,	you	're	going	to	have	these	kind	of	blurry	spots	like	this	that	maybe	only	resemble	eyes	in	a	very	very	abstract	way	.
But	if	I	come	up	really	close	and	stare	directly	at	the	camera	on	this	laptop	then	you	'll	see	these	nice	crisp	eyes	.
You	can	think	of	it	as	a	way	of	,	sort	of	,	typing	,	with	your	eyes	.
And	what	you	're	typing	are	recordings	of	your	eyes	as	you	're	looking	at	other	peoples	'	eyes	.
So	each	person	is	looking	at	the	looking	of	everyone	else	before	them	.
And	this	exists	in	larger	installations	where	there	are	thousands	and	thousands	of	eyes	that	people	could	be	staring	at	,	as	you	see	who	's	looking	at	the	people	looking	at	the	people	looking	before	them	.
So	I	'll	just	add	a	couple	more	.	Blink	.	Blink	.
And	you	can	see	,	just	once	again	,	how	it	's	sort	of	finding	my	eyes	and	doing	its	best	to	estimate	when	it	's	blinking	.
Alright	.	Let	's	leave	that	.
So	that	's	this	kind	of	recursive	observation	system	.
Thank	you	.
The	last	couple	pieces	I	'm	going	to	show	are	basically	in	the	new	realm	of	robotics	--	for	me	,	new	for	me	.
It	's	called	Opto-Isolator	.
And	I	'm	going	to	show	a	video	of	the	older	version	of	it	,	which	is	just	a	minute	long	.	Okay	.
In	this	case	,	the	Opto-Isolator	is	blinking	in	response	to	one	's	own	blinks	.
So	it	blinks	one	second	after	you	do	.
This	is	a	device	which	is	intended	to	reduce	the	phenomenon	of	gaze	down	to	the	simplest	possible	materials	.
Just	one	eye	,	looking	at	you	,	and	eliminating	everything	else	about	a	face	,
but	just	to	consider	gaze	in	an	isolated	way	as	a	kind	of	,	as	an	element	.
And	at	the	same	time	,	it	attempts	to	engage	in	what	you	might	call	familiar	psycho-social	gaze	behaviors	.
Like	looking	away	if	you	look	at	it	too	long	because	it	gets	shy	,
or	things	like	that	.
Okay	.	So	the	last	project	I	'm	going	to	show	is	this	new	one	called	Snout	.
It	's	an	eight-foot	snout	,	with	a	googly	eye	.
And	inside	it	's	got	an	800-pound	robot	arm	that	I	borrowed	,	from	a	friend	.
It	helps	to	have	good	friends	.
I	'm	at	Carnegie	Mellon	;	we	've	got	a	great	Robotics	Institute	there	.
I	'd	like	to	show	you	thing	called	Snout	,	which	is	--
The	idea	behind	this	project	is	to	make	a	robot	that	appears	as	if	it	's	continually	surprised	to	see	you	.
The	idea	is	that	basically	--
if	it	's	constantly	like	``	Huh	?	...	Huh	?	''
That	's	why	its	other	name	is	Doubletaker	,	Taker	of	Doubles	.
It	's	always	kind	of	doing	a	double	take	:	``	What	?	''
And	the	idea	is	basically	,	can	it	look	at	you	and	make	you	feel	as	if	like	,	``	What	?	Is	it	my	shoes	?	''
``	Got	something	on	my	hair	?	''	Here	we	go	.	Alright	.
Checking	him	out	...
For	you	nerds	,	here	's	a	little	behind-the-scenes	.
It	's	got	a	computer	vision	system	,
and	it	tries	to	look	at	the	people	who	are	moving	around	the	most	.
Those	are	its	targets	.
Up	there	is	the	skeleton	,
which	is	actually	what	it	's	trying	to	do	.	It	's	really	about	trying	to	create	a	novel	body	language	for	a	new	creature	.
Hollywood	does	this	all	the	time	,	of	course	.
But	also	have	the	body	language	communicate	something	to	the	person	who	is	looking	at	it	.
This	language	is	communicating	that	it	is	surprised	to	see	you	,	and	it	's	interested	in	looking	at	you	.
Thank	you	very	much	.	That	's	all	I	've	got	for	today	.
And	I	'm	really	happy	to	be	here	.	Thank	you	so	much	.
Four	years	ago	,	on	the	TED	stage	,	I	announced	a	company	I	was	working	with	at	the	time	called	Odeo	.
And	because	of	that	announcement	,	we	got	a	big	article	in	the	New	York	Times	,	which	led	to	more	press	,	which	led	to	more	attention	,	and	me	deciding	to	become	CEO	of	that	company	--	whereas	I	was	just	an	adviser	--	and	raising	a	round	of	venture	capital	and	ramping	up	hiring	.	One	of	the	guys	I	hired	was	an	engineer	named	Jack	Dorsey	,	and	a	year	later	we	were	trying	to	decide	which	way	to	go	with	Odeo	,	and	Jack	presented	an	idea	he	'd	been	tinkering	around	with	for	a	number	of	years	that	was	based	around	sending	simple	status	updates	to	friends	.
We	were	also	playing	with	SMS	at	the	time	at	Odeo	,	so	we	kind	of	put	two	and	two	together	,	and	in	early	2006	we	launched	Twitter	as	a	side	project	at	Odeo	.
Now	,	it	's	hard	to	justify	doing	a	side	project	at	a	startup	,	where	focus	is	so	critical	,	but	I	had	actually	launched	Blogger	as	a	side	project	to	my	previous	company	,	thinking	it	was	just	a	little	thing	we	'd	do	on	the	side	,	and	it	ended	up	taking	over	not	only	the	company	,	but	my	life	over	the	next	five	or	six	years	.
So	I	learned	to	follow	hunches	even	though	you	ca	n't	necessarily	justify	them	or	know	where	they	're	going	to	go	.
And	that	's	kind	of	what	's	happened	with	Twitter	,	time	after	time	.
So	,	for	those	of	you	unfamiliar	,	Twitter	is	based	around	a	very	simple	,	seemingly	trivial	concept	.
You	say	what	you	're	doing	in	140	characters	or	less	,	and	people	who	are	interested	in	you	get	those	updates	.
If	they	're	really	interested	,	they	get	the	update	as	a	text	message	on	their	cell	phone	.
So	,	for	instance	,	I	may	Twitter	right	now	that	I	'm	giving	a	talk	at	TED	.
It	's	a	normal	everyday	thing	.
And	in	my	case	,	when	I	hit	send	,	up	to	60,000	people	will	receive	that	message	in	a	matter	of	seconds	.
Now	,	the	fundamental	idea	is	that	Twitter	lets	people	share	moments	of	their	lives	whenever	they	want	,	be	they	momentous	occasions	or	mundane	ones	.
It	is	by	sharing	these	moments	as	they	're	happening	that	lets	people	feel	more	connected	and	in	touch	,	despite	distance	,	and	in	real	time	.
This	was	the	primary	use	we	saw	for	Twitter	from	the	beginning	,	and	what	got	us	excited	.
What	we	did	n't	anticipate	was	the	many	,	many	other	uses	that	would	evolve	from	this	very	simple	system	.	One	of	the	things	we	realized	was	how	important	Twitter	could	be	during	real-time	events	.
When	the	wildfires	broke	out	in	San	Diego	,	in	October	of	2007	,	people	turned	to	Twitter	to	report	what	was	happening	and	to	find	information	from	neighbors	about	what	was	happening	around	them	.
But	it	was	n't	just	individuals	.
The	L.A.	Times	actually	turned	to	Twitter	to	dispense	information	as	well	,	and	put	a	Twitter	feed	on	the	front	page	,	and	the	L.A.	Fire	Department	and	Red	Cross	used	it	to	dispense	news	and	updates	as	well	.	At	this	event	,	dozens	of	people	are	Twittering	and	thousands	of	people	are	following	along	because	they	want	to	know	what	it	feels	like	to	be	here	and	what	's	happening	.	Among	the	other	interesting	things	that	have	cropped	up	are	many	things	from	businesses	,	from	marketing	and	communications	and	predictable	things	,	to	an	insanely	popular	Korean-barbecue	taco	truck	that	drives	around	L.A.	and	Twitters	where	it	stops	,	causing	a	line	to	form	around	the	block	.	Politicians	have	recently	begun	Twittering	.	In	fact	,	there	are	47	members	of	Congress	who	currently	have	Twitter	accounts	.	And	they	're	tweeting	,	in	some	cases	,	from	behind	closed-door	sessions	with	the	President	.	In	this	case	,	this	guy	's	not	liking	what	he	's	hearing	.
The	President	himself	is	our	most	popular	Twitter	user	,	although	his	tweets	have	dropped	off	as	of	late	,	while	Senator	McCain	's	have	picked	up	.
As	have	this	guy	's	.
Twitter	was	originally	designed	as	a	broadcast	medium	:
you	send	one	message	and	it	goes	out	to	everybody	,	and	you	receive	the	messages	you	're	interested	in	.
One	of	the	many	ways	that	users	shaped	the	evolution	of	Twitter	was	by	inventing	a	way	to	reply	to	a	specific	person	or	a	specific	message	.	So	,	this	syntax	,	the	``	@	username	''	that	Shaquille	O'Neal	's	using	here	to	reply	to	one	of	his	fans	,	was	completely	invented	by	users	,	and	we	did	n't	build	it	into	the	system	until	it	already	became	popular	and	then	we	made	it	easier	.
This	is	one	of	the	many	ways	that	users	have	shaped	the	system	.
Another	is	via	the	API	.
We	built	an	application-programming	interface	,	which	basically	means	that	programmers	can	write	software	that	interacts	with	Twitter	.
We	currently	know	about	over	2,000	pieces	of	software	that	can	send	Twitter	updates	--	interfaces	for	Mac	,	Windows	,	your	iPhone	,	your	BlackBerry	--
as	well	as	things	like	a	device	that	lets	an	unborn	baby	Twitter	when	it	kicks	or	a	plant	Twitter	when	it	needs	water	.	Probably	the	most	important	third-party	development	came	from	a	little	company	in	Virginia	called	Summize	.	Summize	built	a	Twitter	search	engine	.	And	they	tapped	into	the	fact	that	,	if	you	have	millions	of	people	around	the	world	talking	about	what	they	're	doing	and	what	's	around	them	,	you	have	an	incredible	resource	to	find	out	about	any	topic	or	event	while	it	's	going	on	.	This	really	changed	how	we	perceived	Twitter	.	For	instance	,	here	's	what	people	are	saying	about	TED	.	This	is	another	way	that	our	mind	was	shifted	,	and	Twitter	was	n't	what	we	thought	it	was	.	We	liked	this	so	much	we	actually	bought	the	company	and	are	folding	it	into	the	main	product	.	This	not	only	lets	you	view	Twitters	in	different	ways	,	but	it	introduces	new	use	cases	as	well	.
One	of	my	favorites	is	what	happened	a	few	months	ago	when	there	was	a	gas	shortage	in	Atlanta	.	Some	users	figured	out	that	they	would	Twitter	when	they	found	gas	--	where	it	was	,	and	how	much	it	cost	--	and	then	appended	the	keyword	``	#	atlgas	''	so	that	other	people	search	for	that	and	find	gas	themselves	.	And	this	trend	of	people	using	this	communication	network	to	help	each	other	out	goes	far	beyond	the	original	idea	of	just	keeping	up	with	family	and	friends	.	It	's	happened	more	and	more	lately	,	whether	it	's	raising	money	for	homeless	people	or	to	dig	wells	in	Africa	or	for	a	family	in	crisis	.	People	have	raised	tens	of	thousands	of	dollars	over	Twitter	in	a	matter	of	days	on	several	occasions	.	It	seems	like	when	you	give	people	easier	ways	to	share	information	,	more	good	things	happen	.	I	have	no	idea	what	will	happen	next	with	Twitter	.
I	've	learned	to	follow	the	hunch	,	but	never	assume	where	it	will	go	.	Thanks	.
Chris	Anderson	:	We	're	not	quite	done	yet	.
So	,	look	,	if	we	could	have	this	screen	live	...
This	is	actually	the	most	terrifying	thing	that	any	speaker	can	do	after	they	've	been	to	an	event	.	It	's	totally	intimidating	.
So	,	this	would	be	the	Twitter	search	screen	.	Let	's	type	a	couple	of	random	words	into	Twitter	.
For	example	:	``	Evan	Williams	.	''	``	...	give	people	more	information	and	follow	your	hunch	@	#	TED	.	''
``	...	currently	listening	to	Evan	Williams	.	''
Oh	...	``	Evan	Williams	is	just	dying	on	stage	here	at	TED	.
Worst	talk	ever	!	''	Evan	Williams	:	Nice	.	Thanks	.
CA	:	Just	kidding	.	But	,	literally	in	the	eight	minutes	he	was	talking	,	there	are	about	fifty	tweets	that	already	came	on	the	talk	.
So	he	'll	see	every	aspect	of	the	reaction	:	the	fact	that	Barack	Obama	is	the	biggest	Twitterer	,	the	fact	that	it	came	out	of	TED	...	I	do	n't	think	there	's	any	other	way	of	getting	instant	feedback	that	way	.	You	have	build	something	very	fascinating	,	and	it	looks	like	its	best	times	are	still	ahead	of	it	.
So	,	thank	you	very	much	,	Evan	.
That	was	very	interesting	.	EW	:	Thank	you	.
I	'm	a	storyteller	.
And	I	would	like	to	tell	you	a	few	personal	stories	about	what	I	like	to	call	``	the	danger	of	the	single	story	.	''
I	grew	up	on	a	university	campus	in	eastern	Nigeria	.
My	mother	says	that	I	started	reading	at	the	age	of	two	,	although	I	think	four	is	probably	close	to	the	truth	.
So	I	was	an	early	reader	,	and	what	I	read	were	British	and	American	children	's	books	.
I	was	also	an	early	writer	,
and	when	I	began	to	write	,	at	about	the	age	of	seven	,	stories	in	pencil	with	crayon	illustrations	that	my	poor	mother	was	obligated	to	read	,	I	wrote	exactly	the	kinds	of	stories	I	was	reading	:
All	my	characters	were	white	and	blue-eyed	,
they	played	in	the	snow	,	they	ate	apples	,
how	lovely	it	was	that	the	sun	had	come	out	.
Now	,	this	despite	the	fact	that	I	lived	in	Nigeria	.
I	had	never	been	outside	Nigeria	.
We	did	n't	have	snow	,	we	ate	mangoes	,
and	we	never	talked	about	the	weather	,	because	there	was	no	need	to	.
My	characters	also	drank	a	lot	of	ginger	beer	because	the	characters	in	the	British	books	I	read	drank	ginger	beer	.
Never	mind	that	I	had	no	idea	what	ginger	beer	was	.
And	for	many	years	afterwards	,	I	would	have	a	desperate	desire	to	taste	ginger	beer	.
But	that	is	another	story	.
What	this	demonstrates	,	I	think	,	is	how	impressionable	and	vulnerable	we	are	in	the	face	of	a	story	,	particularly	as	children	.
Because	all	I	had	read	were	books	in	which	characters	were	foreign	,	I	had	become	convinced	that	books	by	their	very	nature	had	to	have	foreigners	in	them	and	had	to	be	about	things	with	which	I	could	not	personally	identify	.
Things	changed	when	I	discovered	African	books	.
There	were	n't	many	of	them	available	,	and	they	were	n't	quite	as	easy	to	find	as	the	foreign	books	.
But	because	of	writers	like	Chinua	Achebe	and	Camara	Laye	I	went	through	a	mental	shift	in	my	perception	of	literature	.
I	realized	that	people	like	me	,	girls	with	skin	the	color	of	chocolate	,	whose	kinky	hair	could	not	form	ponytails	,	could	also	exist	in	literature	.
I	started	to	write	about	things	I	recognized	.
Now	,	I	loved	those	American	and	British	books	I	read	.
They	stirred	my	imagination	.	They	opened	up	new	worlds	for	me	.
But	the	unintended	consequence	was	that	I	did	not	know	that	people	like	me	could	exist	in	literature	.
So	what	the	discovery	of	African	writers	did	for	me	was	this	:	It	saved	me	from	having	a	single	story	of	what	books	are	.
I	come	from	a	conventional	,	middle-class	Nigerian	family	.
My	father	was	a	professor	.
My	mother	was	an	administrator	.
And	so	we	had	,	as	was	the	norm	,	live-in	domestic	help	,	who	would	often	come	from	nearby	rural	villages	.
So	the	year	I	turned	eight	we	got	a	new	house	boy	.
His	name	was	Fide	.
The	only	thing	my	mother	told	us	about	him	was	that	his	family	was	very	poor	.
My	mother	sent	yams	and	rice	,	and	our	old	clothes	,	to	his	family	.
And	when	I	did	n't	finish	my	dinner	my	mother	would	say	,	``	Finish	your	food	!	Do	n't	you	know	?	People	like	Fide	's	family	have	nothing	.	''
So	I	felt	enormous	pity	for	Fide	's	family	.
Then	one	Saturday	we	went	to	his	village	to	visit	,
and	his	mother	showed	us	a	beautifully	patterned	basket	made	of	dyed	raffia	that	his	brother	had	made	.
I	was	startled	.
It	had	not	occurred	to	me	that	anybody	in	his	family	could	actually	make	something	.
All	I	had	heard	about	them	was	how	poor	they	were	,	so	that	it	had	become	impossible	for	me	to	see	them	as	anything	else	but	poor	.
Their	poverty	was	my	single	story	of	them	.
Years	later	,	I	thought	about	this	when	I	left	Nigeria	to	go	to	university	in	the	United	States	.
I	was	19	.
My	American	roommate	was	shocked	by	me	.
She	asked	where	I	had	learned	to	speak	English	so	well	,	and	was	confused	when	I	said	that	Nigeria	happened	to	have	English	as	its	official	language	.
She	asked	if	she	could	listen	to	what	she	called	my	``	tribal	music	,	''	and	was	consequently	very	disappointed	when	I	produced	my	tape	of	Mariah	Carey	.
She	assumed	that	I	did	not	know	how	to	use	a	stove	.
What	struck	me	was	this	:	She	had	felt	sorry	for	me	even	before	she	saw	me	.
Her	default	position	toward	me	,	as	an	African	,	was	a	kind	of	patronizing	,	well-meaning	pity	.
My	roommate	had	a	single	story	of	Africa	:
a	single	story	of	catastrophe	.
In	this	single	story	there	was	no	possibility	of	Africans	being	similar	to	her	in	any	way	,
no	possibility	of	feelings	more	complex	than	pity	,
no	possibility	of	a	connection	as	human	equals	.
I	must	say	that	before	I	went	to	the	U.S	.	I	did	n't	consciously	identify	as	African	.	But	in	the	U.S.	whenever	Africa	came	up	people	turned	to	me	.
Never	mind	that	I	knew	nothing	about	places	like	Namibia	.
But	I	did	come	to	embrace	this	new	identity	,
and	in	many	ways	I	think	of	myself	now	as	African	.
Although	I	still	get	quite	irritable	when	Africa	is	referred	to	as	a	country	,
the	most	recent	example	being	my	otherwise	wonderful	flight	from	Lagos	two	days	ago	,	in	which	there	was	an	announcement	on	the	Virgin	flight	about	the	charity	work	in	``	India	,	Africa	and	other	countries	.	''
So	after	I	had	spent	some	years	in	the	U.S.	as	an	African	,	I	began	to	understand	my	roommate	's	response	to	me	.	If	I	had	not	grown	up	in	Nigeria	,	and	if	all	I	knew	about	Africa	were	from	popular	images	,	I	too	would	think	that	Africa	was	a	place	of	beautiful	landscapes	,	beautiful	animals	,	and	incomprehensible	people	,	fighting	senseless	wars	,	dying	of	poverty	and	AIDS	,	unable	to	speak	for	themselves	and	waiting	to	be	saved	by	a	kind	,	white	foreigner	.
I	would	see	Africans	in	the	same	way	that	I	,	as	a	child	,	had	seen	Fide	's	family	.
This	single	story	of	Africa	ultimately	comes	,	I	think	,	from	Western	literature	.
Now	,	here	is	a	quote	from	the	writing	of	a	London	merchant	called	John	Locke	,	who	sailed	to	west	Africa	in	1561	and	kept	a	fascinating	account	of	his	voyage	.
After	referring	to	the	black	Africans	as	``	beasts	who	have	no	houses	,	''	he	writes	,	``	They	are	also	people	without	heads	,	having	their	mouth	and	eyes	in	their	breasts	.	''
Now	,	I	've	laughed	every	time	I	've	read	this	.
And	one	must	admire	the	imagination	of	John	Locke	.
But	what	is	important	about	his	writing	is	that	it	represents	the	beginning	of	a	tradition	of	telling	African	stories	in	the	West	:
A	tradition	of	Sub-Saharan	Africa	as	a	place	of	negatives	,	of	difference	,	of	darkness	,	of	people	who	,	in	the	words	of	the	wonderful	poet	Rudyard	Kipling	,	are	``	half	devil	,	half	child	.	''
And	so	I	began	to	realize	that	my	American	roommate	must	have	throughout	her	life	seen	and	heard	different	versions	of	this	single	story	,	as	had	a	professor	,	who	once	told	me	that	my	novel	was	not	``	authentically	African	.	''
Now	,	I	was	quite	willing	to	contend	that	there	were	a	number	of	things	wrong	with	the	novel	,	that	it	had	failed	in	a	number	of	places	,
but	I	had	not	quite	imagined	that	it	had	failed	at	achieving	something	called	African	authenticity	.
In	fact	I	did	not	know	what	African	authenticity	was	.
The	professor	told	me	that	my	characters	were	too	much	like	him	,	an	educated	and	middle-class	man	.
My	characters	drove	cars	.
They	were	not	starving	.
Therefore	they	were	not	authentically	African	.
But	I	must	quickly	add	that	I	too	am	just	as	guilty	in	the	question	of	the	single	story	.
A	few	years	ago	,	I	visited	Mexico	from	the	U.S	.
The	political	climate	in	the	U.S.	at	the	time	was	tense	,
and	there	were	debates	going	on	about	immigration	.
And	,	as	often	happens	in	America	,	immigration	became	synonymous	with	Mexicans	.
There	were	endless	stories	of	Mexicans	as	people	who	were	fleecing	the	healthcare	system	,	sneaking	across	the	border	,	being	arrested	at	the	border	,	that	sort	of	thing	.
I	remember	walking	around	on	my	first	day	in	Guadalajara	,	watching	the	people	going	to	work	,	rolling	up	tortillas	in	the	marketplace	,	smoking	,	laughing	.
I	remember	first	feeling	slight	surprise	.
And	then	I	was	overwhelmed	with	shame	.
I	realized	that	I	had	been	so	immersed	in	the	media	coverage	of	Mexicans	that	they	had	become	one	thing	in	my	mind	,	the	abject	immigrant	.
I	had	bought	into	the	single	story	of	Mexicans	and	I	could	not	have	been	more	ashamed	of	myself	.
So	that	is	how	to	create	a	single	story	,	show	a	people	as	one	thing	,	as	only	one	thing	,	over	and	over	again	,	and	that	is	what	they	become	.
It	is	impossible	to	talk	about	the	single	story	without	talking	about	power	.
There	is	a	word	,	an	Igbo	word	,	that	I	think	about	whenever	I	think	about	the	power	structures	of	the	world	,	and	it	is	``	nkali	.	''
It	's	a	noun	that	loosely	translates	to	``	to	be	greater	than	another	.	''
Like	our	economic	and	political	worlds	,	stories	too	are	defined	by	the	principle	of	nkali	:
How	they	are	told	,	who	tells	them	,	when	they	're	told	,	how	many	stories	are	told	,	are	really	dependent	on	power	.
Power	is	the	ability	not	just	to	tell	the	story	of	another	person	,	but	to	make	it	the	definitive	story	of	that	person	.
The	Palestinian	poet	Mourid	Barghouti	writes	that	if	you	want	to	dispossess	a	people	,	the	simplest	way	to	do	it	is	to	tell	their	story	and	to	start	with	,	``	secondly	.	''
Start	the	story	with	the	arrows	of	the	Native	Americans	,	and	not	with	the	arrival	of	the	British	,	and	you	have	an	entirely	different	story	.
Start	the	story	with	the	failure	of	the	African	state	,	and	not	with	the	colonial	creation	of	the	African	state	,	and	you	have	an	entirely	different	story	.
I	recently	spoke	at	a	university	where	a	student	told	me	that	it	was	such	a	shame	that	Nigerian	men	were	physical	abusers	like	the	father	character	in	my	novel	.
I	told	him	that	I	had	just	read	a	novel	called	American	Psycho	--	--	and	that	it	was	such	a	shame	that	young	Americans	were	serial	murderers	.
Now	,	obviously	I	said	this	in	a	fit	of	mild	irritation	.
But	it	would	never	have	occurred	to	me	to	think	that	just	because	I	had	read	a	novel	in	which	a	character	was	a	serial	killer	that	he	was	somehow	representative	of	all	Americans	.
This	is	not	because	I	am	a	better	person	than	that	student	,	but	because	of	America	's	cultural	and	economic	power	,	I	had	many	stories	of	America	.
I	had	read	Tyler	and	Updike	and	Steinbeck	and	Gaitskill	.
I	did	not	have	a	single	story	of	America	.
When	I	learned	,	some	years	ago	,	that	writers	were	expected	to	have	had	really	unhappy	childhoods	to	be	successful	,	I	began	to	think	about	how	I	could	invent	horrible	things	my	parents	had	done	to	me	.
But	the	truth	is	that	I	had	a	very	happy	childhood	,	full	of	laughter	and	love	,	in	a	very	close-knit	family	.
But	I	also	had	grandfathers	who	died	in	refugee	camps	.
My	cousin	Polle	died	because	he	could	not	get	adequate	healthcare	.
One	of	my	closest	friends	,	Okoloma	,	died	in	a	plane	crash	because	our	fire	trucks	did	not	have	water	.
I	grew	up	under	repressive	military	governments	that	devalued	education	,	so	that	sometimes	my	parents	were	not	paid	their	salaries	.
And	so	,	as	a	child	,	I	saw	jam	disappear	from	the	breakfast	table	,	then	margarine	disappeared	,	then	bread	became	too	expensive	,	then	milk	became	rationed	.
And	most	of	all	,	a	kind	of	normalized	political	fear	invaded	our	lives	.
All	of	these	stories	make	me	who	I	am	.
But	to	insist	on	only	these	negative	stories	is	to	flatten	my	experience	and	to	overlook	the	many	other	stories	that	formed	me	.
The	single	story	creates	stereotypes	,
and	the	problem	with	stereotypes	is	not	that	they	are	untrue	,	but	that	they	are	incomplete	.
They	make	one	story	become	the	only	story	.
Of	course	,	Africa	is	a	continent	full	of	catastrophes	:
There	are	immense	ones	,	such	as	the	horrific	rapes	in	Congo
and	depressing	ones	,	such	as	the	fact	that	5,000	people	apply	for	one	job	vacancy	in	Nigeria	.
But	there	are	other	stories	that	are	not	about	catastrophe	,
and	it	is	very	important	,	it	is	just	as	important	,	to	talk	about	them	.
I	've	always	felt	that	it	is	impossible	to	engage	properly	with	a	place	or	a	person	without	engaging	with	all	of	the	stories	of	that	place	and	that	person	.
The	consequence	of	the	single	story	is	this	:	It	robs	people	of	dignity	.
It	makes	our	recognition	of	our	equal	humanity	difficult	.
It	emphasizes	how	we	are	different	rather	than	how	we	are	similar	.
So	what	if	before	my	Mexican	trip	I	had	followed	the	immigration	debate	from	both	sides	,	the	U.S.	and	the	Mexican	?
What	if	my	mother	had	told	us	that	Fide	's	family	was	poor	and	hardworking	?
What	if	we	had	an	African	television	network	that	broadcast	diverse	African	stories	all	over	the	world	?
What	the	Nigerian	writer	Chinua	Achebe	calls	``	a	balance	of	stories	.	''
What	if	my	roommate	knew	about	my	Nigerian	publisher	,	Mukta	Bakaray	,	a	remarkable	man	who	left	his	job	in	a	bank	to	follow	his	dream	and	start	a	publishing	house	?
Now	,	the	conventional	wisdom	was	that	Nigerians	do	n't	read	literature	.
He	disagreed	.	He	felt	that	people	who	could	read	,	would	read	,	if	you	made	literature	affordable	and	available	to	them	.
Shortly	after	he	published	my	first	novel	I	went	to	a	TV	station	in	Lagos	to	do	an	interview	,
and	a	woman	who	worked	there	as	a	messenger	came	up	to	me	and	said	,	``	I	really	liked	your	novel	.	I	did	n't	like	the	ending	.
Now	you	must	write	a	sequel	,	and	this	is	what	will	happen	...	''
And	she	went	on	to	tell	me	what	to	write	in	the	sequel	.
I	was	not	only	charmed	,	I	was	very	moved	.
Here	was	a	woman	,	part	of	the	ordinary	masses	of	Nigerians	,	who	were	not	supposed	to	be	readers	.
She	had	not	only	read	the	book	,	but	she	had	taken	ownership	of	it	and	felt	justified	in	telling	me	what	to	write	in	the	sequel	.
Now	,	what	if	my	roommate	knew	about	my	friend	Fumi	Onda	,	a	fearless	woman	who	hosts	a	TV	show	in	Lagos	,	and	is	determined	to	tell	the	stories	that	we	prefer	to	forget	?
What	if	my	roommate	knew	about	the	heart	procedure	that	was	performed	in	the	Lagos	hospital	last	week	?
What	if	my	roommate	knew	about	contemporary	Nigerian	music	,
talented	people	singing	in	English	and	Pidgin	,	and	Igbo	and	Yoruba	and	Ijo	,	mixing	influences	from	Jay-Z	to	Fela	to	Bob	Marley	to	their	grandfathers	.
What	if	my	roommate	knew	about	the	female	lawyer	who	recently	went	to	court	in	Nigeria	to	challenge	a	ridiculous	law	that	required	women	to	get	their	husband	's	consent	before	renewing	their	passports	?
What	if	my	roommate	knew	about	Nollywood	,	full	of	innovative	people	making	films	despite	great	technical	odds	,
films	so	popular	that	they	really	are	the	best	example	of	Nigerians	consuming	what	they	produce	?
What	if	my	roommate	knew	about	my	wonderfully	ambitious	hair	braider	,	who	has	just	started	her	own	business	selling	hair	extensions	?
Or	about	the	millions	of	other	Nigerians	who	start	businesses	and	sometimes	fail	,	but	continue	to	nurse	ambition	?
Every	time	I	am	home	I	am	confronted	with	the	usual	sources	of	irritation	for	most	Nigerians	:	our	failed	infrastructure	,	our	failed	government	,
but	also	by	the	incredible	resilience	of	people	who	thrive	despite	the	government	,	rather	than	because	of	it	.
I	teach	writing	workshops	in	Lagos	every	summer	,
and	it	is	amazing	to	me	how	many	people	apply	,	how	many	people	are	eager	to	write	,	to	tell	stories	.
My	Nigerian	publisher	and	I	have	just	started	a	non-profit	called	Farafina	Trust	,
and	we	have	big	dreams	of	building	libraries	and	refurbishing	libraries	that	already	exist
and	providing	books	for	state	schools	that	do	n't	have	anything	in	their	libraries	,
and	also	of	organizing	lots	and	lots	of	workshops	,	in	reading	and	writing	,	for	all	the	people	who	are	eager	to	tell	our	many	stories	.
Stories	matter	.
Many	stories	matter	.
Stories	have	been	used	to	dispossess	and	to	malign	,
but	stories	can	also	be	used	to	empower	and	to	humanize	.
Stories	can	break	the	dignity	of	a	people	,
but	stories	can	also	repair	that	broken	dignity	.
The	American	writer	Alice	Walker	wrote	this	about	her	Southern	relatives	who	had	moved	to	the	North	.
She	introduced	them	to	a	book	about	the	Southern	life	that	they	had	left	behind	:
``	They	sat	around	,	reading	the	book	themselves	,	listening	to	me	read	the	book	,	and	a	kind	of	paradise	was	regained	.	''
I	would	like	to	end	with	this	thought	:	That	when	we	reject	the	single	story	,	when	we	realize	that	there	is	never	a	single	story	about	any	place	,	we	regain	a	kind	of	paradise	.
Thank	you	.
It	's	Monday	morning	.
In	Washington	,	the	president	of	the	United	States	is	sitting	in	the	Oval	Office	,	assessing	whether	or	not	to	strike	Al	Qaeda	in	Yemen	.
At	Number	10	Downing	Street	,	David	Cameron	is	trying	to	work	out	whether	to	cut	more	public	sector	jobs	in	order	to	stave	off	a	double-dip	recession	.
In	Madrid	,	Maria	Gonzalez	is	standing	at	the	door	,	listening	to	her	baby	crying	and	crying	,	trying	to	work	out	whether	she	should	let	it	cry	until	it	falls	asleep	or	pick	it	up	and	hold	it	.
And	I	am	sitting	by	my	father	's	bedside	in	hospital	,	trying	to	work	out	whether	I	should	let	him	drink	the	one-and-a-half-liter	bottle	of	water	that	his	doctors	just	came	in	and	said	,	``	You	must	make	him	drink	today	,	''	--	my	father	's	been	nil	by	mouth	for	a	week	--	or	whether	,	by	giving	him	this	bottle	,	I	might	actually	kill	him	.
We	face	momentous	decisions	with	important	consequences	throughout	our	lives	,
and	we	have	strategies	for	dealing	with	these	decisions	.
We	talk	things	over	with	our	friends	,	we	scour	the	Internet	,	we	search	through	books	.	But	still	,	even	in	this	age	of	Google	and	TripAdvisor	and	Amazon	Recommends	,	it	's	still	experts	that	we	rely	upon	most	--	especially	when	the	stakes	are	high	and	the	decision	really	matters	.
Because	in	a	world	of	data	deluge	and	extreme	complexity	,	we	believe	that	experts	are	more	able	to	process	information	than	we	can	--	that	they	are	able	to	come	to	better	conclusions	than	we	could	come	to	on	our	own	.
And	in	an	age	that	is	sometimes	nowadays	frightening	or	confusing	,	we	feel	reassured	by	the	almost	parental-like	authority	of	experts	who	tell	us	so	clearly	what	it	is	we	can	and	can	not	do	.
But	I	believe	that	this	is	a	big	problem	,	a	problem	with	potentially	dangerous	consequences	for	us	as	a	society	,	as	a	culture	and	as	individuals	.
It	's	not	that	experts	have	not	massively	contributed	to	the	world	--	of	course	they	have	.
The	problem	lies	with	us	:	we	've	become	addicted	to	experts	.
We	've	become	addicted	to	their	certainty	,	their	assuredness	,	their	definitiveness	,	and	in	the	process	,	we	have	ceded	our	responsibility	,	substituting	our	intellect	and	our	intelligence	for	their	supposed	words	of	wisdom	.
We	've	surrendered	our	power	,	trading	off	our	discomfort	with	uncertainty	for	the	illusion	of	certainty	that	they	provide	.
This	is	no	exaggeration	.
In	a	recent	experiment	,	a	group	of	adults	had	their	brains	scanned	in	an	MRI	machine	as	they	were	listening	to	experts	speak	.
The	results	were	quite	extraordinary	.
As	they	listened	to	the	experts	'	voices	,	the	independent	decision-making	parts	of	their	brains	switched	off	.
It	literally	flat-lined	.
And	they	listened	to	whatever	the	experts	said	and	took	their	advice	,	however	right	or	wrong	.
But	experts	do	get	things	wrong	.
Did	you	know	that	studies	show	that	doctors	misdiagnose	four	times	out	of	10	?
Did	you	know	that	if	you	file	your	tax	returns	yourself	,	you	're	statistically	more	likely	to	be	filing	them	correctly	than	if	you	get	a	tax	adviser	to	do	it	for	you	?
And	then	there	's	,	of	course	,	the	example	that	we	're	all	too	aware	of	:	financial	experts	getting	it	so	wrong	that	we	're	living	through	the	worst	recession	since	the	1930s	.
For	the	sake	of	our	health	,	our	wealth	and	our	collective	security	,	it	's	imperative	that	we	keep	the	independent	decision-making	parts	of	our	brains	switched	on	.
And	I	'm	saying	this	as	an	economist	who	,	over	the	past	few	years	,	has	focused	my	research	on	what	it	is	we	think	and	who	it	is	we	trust	and	why	,
but	also	--	and	I	'm	aware	of	the	irony	here	--	as	an	expert	myself	,	as	a	professor	,	as	somebody	who	advises	prime	ministers	,	heads	of	big	companies	,	international	organizations	,	but	an	expert	who	believes	that	the	role	of	experts	needs	to	change	,	that	we	need	to	become	more	open-minded	,	more	democratic	and	be	more	open	to	people	rebelling	against	our	points	of	view	.
So	in	order	to	help	you	understand	where	I	'm	coming	from	,	let	me	bring	you	into	my	world	,	the	world	of	experts	.
Now	there	are	,	of	course	,	exceptions	,	wonderful	,	civilization-enhancing	exceptions	.	But	what	my	research	has	shown	me	is	that	experts	tend	on	the	whole	to	form	very	rigid	camps	,	that	within	these	camps	,	a	dominant	perspective	emerges	that	often	silences	opposition	,	that	experts	move	with	the	prevailing	winds	,	often	hero-worshipping	their	own	gurus	.
Alan	Greenspan	's	proclamations	that	the	years	of	economic	growth	would	go	on	and	on	,	not	challenged	by	his	peers	,	until	after	the	crisis	,	of	course	.
You	see	,	we	also	learn	that	experts	are	located	,	are	governed	,	by	the	social	and	cultural	norms	of	their	times	--	whether	it	be	the	doctors	in	Victorian	England	,	say	,	who	sent	women	to	asylums	for	expressing	sexual	desire	,	or	the	psychiatrists	in	the	United	States	who	,	up	until	1973	,	were	still	categorizing	homosexuality	as	a	mental	illness	.
And	what	all	this	means	is	that	paradigms	take	far	too	long	to	shift	,	that	complexity	and	nuance	are	ignored	and	also	that	money	talks	--	because	we	've	all	seen	the	evidence	of	pharmaceutical	companies	funding	studies	of	drugs	that	conveniently	leave	out	their	worst	side	effects	,	or	studies	funded	by	food	companies	of	their	new	products	,	massively	exaggerating	the	health	benefits	of	the	products	they	're	about	to	bring	by	market	.
The	study	showed	that	food	companies	exaggerated	typically	seven	times	more	than	an	independent	study	.
And	we	've	also	got	to	be	aware	that	experts	,	of	course	,	also	make	mistakes	.
They	make	mistakes	every	single	day	--	mistakes	born	out	of	carelessness	.
A	recent	study	in	the	Archives	of	Surgery	reported	surgeons	removing	healthy	ovaries	,	operating	on	the	wrong	side	of	the	brain	,	carrying	out	procedures	on	the	wrong	hand	,	elbow	,	eye	,	foot	,	and	also	mistakes	born	out	of	thinking	errors	.
A	common	thinking	error	of	radiologists	,	for	example	--	when	they	look	at	CT	scans	--	is	that	they	're	overly	influenced	by	whatever	it	is	that	the	referring	physician	has	said	that	he	suspects	the	patient	's	problem	to	be	.
So	if	a	radiologist	is	looking	at	the	scan	of	a	patient	with	suspected	pneumonia	,	say	,	what	happens	is	that	,	if	they	see	evidence	of	pneumonia	on	the	scan	,	they	literally	stop	looking	at	it	--	thereby	missing	the	tumor	sitting	three	inches	below	on	the	patient	's	lungs	.
I	've	shared	with	you	so	far	some	insights	into	the	world	of	experts	.
These	are	,	of	course	,	not	the	only	insights	I	could	share	,	but	I	hope	they	give	you	a	clear	sense	at	least	of	why	we	need	to	stop	kowtowing	to	them	,	why	we	need	to	rebel	and	why	we	need	to	switch	our	independent	decision-making	capabilities	on	.
But	how	can	we	do	this	?
Well	for	the	sake	of	time	,	I	want	to	focus	on	just	three	strategies	.
First	,	we	've	got	to	be	ready	and	willing	to	take	experts	on	and	dispense	with	this	notion	of	them	as	modern-day	apostles	.
This	does	n't	mean	having	to	get	a	Ph.D.	in	every	single	subject	,	you	'll	be	relieved	to	hear	.
But	it	does	mean	persisting	in	the	face	of	their	inevitable	annoyance	when	,	for	example	,	we	want	them	to	explain	things	to	us	in	language	that	we	can	actually	understand	.
Why	was	it	that	,	when	I	had	an	operation	,	my	doctor	said	to	me	,	``	Beware	,	Ms.	Hertz	,	of	hyperpyrexia	,	''	when	he	could	have	just	as	easily	said	,	``	Watch	out	for	a	high	fever	.	''
You	see	,	being	ready	to	take	experts	on	is	about	also	being	willing	to	dig	behind	their	graphs	,	their	equations	,	their	forecasts	,	their	prophecies	,	and	being	armed	with	the	questions	to	do	that	--	questions	like	:	What	are	the	assumptions	that	underpin	this	?
What	is	the	evidence	upon	which	this	is	based	?
What	has	your	investigation	focused	on	?
And	what	has	it	ignored	?
It	recently	came	out	that	experts	trialing	drugs	before	they	come	to	market	typically	trial	drugs	first	,	primarily	on	male	animals	and	then	,	primarily	on	men	.
It	seems	that	they	've	somehow	overlooked	the	fact	that	over	half	the	world	's	population	are	women	.
And	women	have	drawn	the	short	medical	straw	because	it	now	turns	out	that	many	of	these	drugs	do	n't	work	nearly	as	well	on	women	as	they	do	on	men	--	and	the	drugs	that	do	work	well	work	so	well	that	they	're	actively	harmful	for	women	to	take	.
Being	a	rebel	is	about	recognizing	that	experts	'	assumptions	and	their	methodologies	can	easily	be	flawed	.
Second	,	we	need	to	create	the	space	for	what	I	call	``	managed	dissent	.	''
If	we	are	to	shift	paradigms	,	if	we	are	to	make	breakthroughs	,	if	we	are	to	destroy	myths	,	we	need	to	create	an	environment	in	which	expert	ideas	are	battling	it	out	,	in	which	we	're	bringing	in	new	,	diverse	,	discordant	,	heretical	views	into	the	discussion	,	fearlessly	,	in	the	knowledge	that	progress	comes	about	,	not	only	from	the	creation	of	ideas	,	but	also	from	their	destruction	--	and	also	from	the	knowledge	that	,	by	surrounding	ourselves	by	divergent	,	discordant	,	heretical	views	.	All	the	research	now	shows	us	that	this	actually	makes	us	smarter	.
Encouraging	dissent	is	a	rebellious	notion	because	it	goes	against	our	very	instincts	,	which	are	to	surround	ourselves	with	opinions	and	advice	that	we	already	believe	or	want	to	be	true	.
And	that	's	why	I	talk	about	the	need	to	actively	manage	dissent	.
Google	CEO	Eric	Schmidt	is	a	practical	practitioner	of	this	philosophy	.
In	meetings	,	he	looks	out	for	the	person	in	the	room	--	arms	crossed	,	looking	a	bit	bemused	--	and	draws	them	into	the	discussion	,	trying	to	see	if	they	indeed	are	the	person	with	a	different	opinion	,	so	that	they	have	dissent	within	the	room	.
Managing	dissent	is	about	recognizing	the	value	of	disagreement	,	discord	and	difference	.
But	we	need	to	go	even	further	.
We	need	to	fundamentally	redefine	who	it	is	that	experts	are	.
The	conventional	notion	is	that	experts	are	people	with	advanced	degrees	,	fancy	titles	,	diplomas	,	best-selling	books	--	high-status	individuals	.
But	just	imagine	if	we	were	to	junk	this	notion	of	expertise	as	some	sort	of	elite	cadre	and	instead	embrace	the	notion	of	democratized	expertise	--	whereby	expertise	was	not	just	the	preserve	of	surgeons	and	CEO	's	,	but	also	shop-girls	--	yeah	.
Best	Buy	,	the	consumer	electronics	company	,	gets	all	its	employees	--	the	cleaners	,	the	shop	assistants	,	the	people	in	the	back	office	,	not	just	its	forecasting	team	--	to	place	bets	,	yes	bets	,	on	things	like	whether	or	not	a	product	is	going	to	sell	well	before	Christmas	,	on	whether	customers	'	new	ideas	are	going	to	be	or	should	be	taken	on	by	the	company	,	on	whether	a	project	will	come	in	on	time	.
By	leveraging	and	by	embracing	the	expertise	within	the	company	,	Best	Buy	was	able	to	discover	,	for	example	,	that	the	store	that	it	was	going	to	open	in	China	--	its	big	,	grand	store	--	was	not	going	to	open	on	time	.
Because	when	it	asked	its	staff	,	all	its	staff	,	to	place	their	bets	on	whether	they	thought	the	store	would	open	on	time	or	not	,	a	group	from	the	finance	department	placed	all	their	chips	on	that	not	happening	.
It	turned	out	that	they	were	aware	,	as	no	one	else	within	the	company	was	,	of	a	technological	blip	that	neither	the	forecasting	experts	,	nor	the	experts	on	the	ground	in	China	,	were	even	aware	of	.
The	strategies	that	I	have	discussed	this	evening	--	embracing	dissent	,	taking	experts	on	,	democratizing	expertise	,	rebellious	strategies	--	are	strategies	that	I	think	would	serve	us	all	well	to	embrace	as	we	try	to	deal	with	the	challenges	of	these	very	confusing	,	complex	,	difficult	times	.
For	if	we	keep	our	independent	decision-making	part	of	our	brains	switched	on	,	if	we	challenge	experts	,	if	we	're	skeptical	,	if	we	devolve	authority	,	if	we	are	rebellious	,	but	also	if	we	become	much	more	comfortable	with	nuance	,	uncertainty	and	doubt	,	and	if	we	allow	our	experts	to	express	themselves	using	those	terms	too	,	we	will	set	ourselves	up	much	better	for	the	challenges	of	the	21st	century	.
For	now	,	more	than	ever	,	is	not	the	time	to	be	blindly	following	,	blindly	accepting	,	blindly	trusting	.
Now	is	the	time	to	face	the	world	with	eyes	wide	open	--	yes	,	using	experts	to	help	us	figure	things	out	,	for	sure	--	I	do	n't	want	to	completely	do	myself	out	of	a	job	here	--	but	being	aware	of	their	limitations	and	,	of	course	,	also	our	own	.
Thank	you	.
So	how	would	you	run	a	whole	country	without	oil	?
That	's	the	question	that	sort	of	hit	me	in	the	middle	of	a	Davos	afternoon	about	four	years	ago	.
It	never	left	my	brain	.
And	I	started	playing	with	it	more	like	a	puzzle	.
The	original	thought	I	had	:	this	must	be	ethanol	.
So	I	went	out	and	researched	ethanol	,
and	found	out	you	need	the	Amazon	in	your	backyard	in	every	country	.
About	six	months	later	I	figured	out	it	must	be	hydrogen	,	until	some	scientist	told	me	the	unfortunate	truth	,	which	is	,	you	actually	use	more	clean	electrons	than	the	ones	you	get	inside	a	car	,	if	you	use	hydrogen	.
So	that	is	not	going	to	be	the	path	to	go	.
And	then	sort	of	through	a	process	of	wandering	around	,	I	got	to	the	thought	that	actually	if	you	could	convert	an	entire	country	to	electric	cars	,	in	a	way	that	is	convenient	and	affordable	,	you	could	get	to	a	solution	.
Now	I	started	this	from	a	point	of	view	that	it	has	to	be	something	that	scales	en	masse	.
Not	how	do	you	build	one	car	,
but	how	do	you	scale	this	so	that	it	can	become	something	that	is	used	by	99	percent	of	the	population	?
The	thought	that	came	to	mind	is	that	it	needs	to	be	as	good	as	any	car	that	you	would	have	today	.
So	one	,	it	has	to	be	more	convenient	than	a	car	.
And	two	,	it	has	be	more	affordable	than	today	's	cars	.
Affordable	is	not	a	40,000	dollar	sedan	,	right	?
Alright	?	That	's	not	something	that	we	can	finance	or	buy	today	.
And	convenient	is	not	something	that	you	drive	for	an	hour	and	charge	for	eight	.
So	we	're	bound	with	the	laws	of	physics	and	the	laws	of	economics	.
And	so	the	thought	that	I	started	with	was	how	do	you	do	this	,	still	within	the	boundary	of	the	science	we	know	today	--	no	time	for	science	fair	,	no	time	for	playing	around	with	things	or	waiting	for	the	magic	battery	to	show	up	.
How	do	you	do	it	within	the	economics	that	we	have	today	?
How	do	you	do	it	from	the	power	of	the	consumer	up	?
And	not	from	the	power	of	an	edict	down	.
On	a	random	visit	to	Tesla	on	some	afternoon	,	I	actually	found	out	that	the	answer	comes	from	separating	between	the	car	ownership	and	the	battery	ownership	.
In	a	sense	if	you	want	to	think	about	it	this	is	the	classic	``	batteries	not	included	.	''
Now	if	you	separate	between	the	two	,	you	could	actually	answer	the	need	for	a	convenient	car	by	creating	a	network	,	by	creating	a	network	before	the	cars	show	up	.
The	network	has	two	components	in	them	.
First	component	is	you	charge	the	car	whenever	you	stop	--
ends	up	that	cars	are	these	strange	beasts	that	drive	for	about	two	hours	and	park	for	about	22	hours	.
If	you	drive	a	car	in	the	morning	and	drive	it	back	in	the	afternoon	the	ratio	of	charge	to	drive	is	about	a	minute	for	a	minute	.
And	so	the	first	thought	that	came	to	mind	is	,	everywhere	we	park	we	have	electric	power	.
Now	it	sounds	crazy	.	But	in	some	places	around	the	world	,	like	Scandinavia	,	you	already	have	that	.
If	you	park	your	car	and	did	n't	plug	in	the	heater	,	when	you	come	back	you	do	n't	have	a	car	.	It	just	does	n't	work	.
Now	that	last	mile	,	last	foot	,	in	a	sense	,	is	the	first	step	of	the	infrastructure	.
The	second	step	of	the	infrastructure	needs	to	take	care	of	the	range	extension	.
See	we	're	bound	by	today	's	technology	on	batteries	,	which	is	about	120	miles	if	you	want	to	stay	within	reasonable	space	and	weight	limitations	.
120	miles	is	a	good	enough	range	for	a	lot	of	people	.
But	you	never	want	to	get	stuck	.
So	what	we	added	is	a	second	element	to	our	network	,	which	is	a	battery	swap	system	.
You	drive	.	You	take	your	depleted	battery	out	.
A	full	battery	comes	on	.	And	you	drive	on	.
You	do	n't	do	it	as	a	human	being	.	You	do	it	as	a	machine	.
It	looks	like	a	car	wash.	You	come	into	your	car	wash	.
And	a	plate	comes	up	,	holds	your	battery	,	takes	it	out	,	puts	it	back	in	,	and
within	two	minutes	you	're	back	on	the	road
and	you	can	go	again	.
If	you	had	charge	spots	everywhere	,	and	you	had	battery	swap	stations	everywhere	,	how	often	would	you	do	it	?	And	it	ends	up	that	you	'd	do	swapping	less	times	than	you	stop	at	a	gas	station	.
As	a	matter	of	fact	,	we	added	to	the	contract	.
We	said	that	if	you	stop	to	swap	your	battery	more	than	50	times	a	year	we	start	paying	you	money	because	it	's	an	inconvenience	.
Then	we	looked	at	the	question	of	the	affordability	.
We	looked	at	the	question	,	what	happens	when	the	battery	is	disconnected	from	the	car	.
What	is	the	cost	of	that	battery	?
Everybody	tells	us	batteries	are	so	expensive	.
What	we	found	out	,	when	you	move	from	molecules	to	electrons	,	something	interesting	happens	.
We	can	go	back	to	the	original	economics	of	the	car	and	look	at	it	again	.
The	battery	is	not	the	gas	tank	,	in	a	sense	.
Remember	in	your	car	you	have	a	gas	tank	.
You	have	the	crude	oil	.
And	you	have	refining	and	delivery	of	that	crude	oil	as	what	we	call	petrol	or	gasoline	.
The	battery	in	this	sense	,	is	the	crude	oil	.
We	have	a	battery	bay	.	It	costs	the	same	hundred	dollars	as	the	gas	tank	.
But	the	crude	oil	is	replaced	with	a	battery	.	Just	it	does	n't	burn	.	It	consumes	itself
step	after	step	after	step	.
It	has	2,000	life	cycles	these	days	.
And	so	it	's	sort	of	a	mini	well	.
We	were	asked	in	the	past	when	we	bought	an	electric	car	to	pay	for	the	entire	well	,	for	the	life	of	the	car	.
Nobody	wants	to	buy	a	mini	well	when	they	buy	a	car	.
In	a	sense	what	we	've	done	is	we	've	created	a	new	consumable	.
You	,	today	,	buy	gasoline	miles	.
And	we	created	electric	miles	.
And	the	price	of	electric	miles	ends	up	being	a	very	interesting	number	.
Today	2010	,	in	volume	,	when	we	come	to	market	,	it	is	eight	cents	a	mile	.
Those	of	you	who	have	a	hard	time	calculating	what	that	means	--	in	the	average	consumer
environment	we	're	in	in	the	U.S	.
20	miles	per	gallon	that	's	a	buck	50	,	a	buck	60	a	gallon	.
That	's	cheaper	than	today	's	gasoline	,	even	in	the	U.S	.
In	Europe	where	taxes	are	in	place	,	that	's	the	equivalent	to	a	minus	60	dollar	barrel	.
But	e-miles	follow	Moore	's	Law	.
They	go	from	eight	cents	a	mile	in	2010	,	to	four	cents	a	mile	in	2015	,	to	two	cents	a	mile	by	2020	.
Why	?	Because	batteries	life	cycle	improve	--	a	bit	of	improvement	on	energy	density	,	which	reduces	the	price	.
And	these	prices	are	actually	with	clean	electrons	.
We	do	not	use	any	electrons	that	come	from	coal	.
So	in	a	sense	this	is	an	absolute	zero-carbon	,	zero-fossil	fuel	electric	mile	at	two	cents	a	mile	by	2020	.
Now	even	if	we	get	to	40	miles	per	gallon	by	2020	,	which	is	our	desire	.
Imagine	only	40	miles	per	gallon	cars	would	be	on	the	road	.
That	is	an	80	cent	gallon	.
An	80	cent	gallon	means	,	if	the	entire	Pacific	would	convert	to	crude	oil	,	and	we	'd	let	any	oil	company	bring	it	out	and	refine	it	,	they	still	ca	n't	compete	with	two	cents	a	mile	.
That	's	a	new	economic	factor	,	which	is	fascinating	to	most	people	.
Now	this	would	have	been	a	wonderful	paper	.
That	's	how	I	solved	it	in	my	head	.	It	was	a	white	paper	I	handed	out	to	governments	.
And	some	governments	told	me	that	it	's	fascinating	that	the	younger	generation	actually	thinks	about	these	things	.
Until	I	got	to	the	true	young	global	leader	,	Shimon	Peres	,	President	of	Israel	,
and	he	ran	a	beautiful	manipulation	on	me	.
First	he	let	me	go	to	the	prime	minister	of	the	country	,
who	told	me	,	if	you	can	find	the	money	you	need	for	this	network	,	200	million	dollars	,	and	if	you	can	find	a	car	company	that	will	build	that	car	in	mass	volume	,	in	two	million	cars	--	that	's	what	we	needed	in	Israel	--
I	'll	give	you	country	to	invest	the	200	million	into	.
Peres	thought	that	was	a	great	idea	.
So	we	went	out	,	and	we	looked	at	all	the	car	companies	.
We	sent	letters	to	all	the	car	companies	.
Three	of	them	never	showed	up	.	One	of	them	asked	us
if	we	would	stay	with	hybrids	and	they	would	give	us	a	discount	.
But	one	of	them	Carlos	Ghosn	,	CEO	of	Renault	and	Nissan	,	when	asked	about	hybrids	said	something	very	fascinating	.
He	said	hybrids	are	like	mermaids	.
When	you	want	a	fish	you	get	a	woman	and	when	you	need	a	woman	you	get	a	fish	.
And	Ghosn	came	up	and	said	,	``	I	have	the	car	,	Mr.	Peres	;	I	will	build	you	the	cars	.	''
And	actually	true	to	form	,	Renault	has	put	a	billion	and	a	half	dollars	in	building	nine	different	types	of	cars	that	fit	this	kind	of	model	that	will	come	into	the	market	in	mass	volume	--	mass	volume	being	the	first	year	,	100	thousand	cars	.
It	's	the	first	mass-volume	electric	car	,
zero-emission	electric	car	in	the	market	.
I	was	running	,	as	Chris	said	,	to	be	the	CEO	of	a	large	software	company	called	SAP	And	then	Peres	said	,	``	Well	wo	n't	you	run	this	project	?	''
And	I	said	,	``	I	'm	ready	for	CEO	''	And	he	said	,	``	Oh	no	no	no	no	no	.	You	've	got	to	explain	to	me	,	what	is	more	important	than	saving	your	country	and	saving	the	world	,	that	you	would	go	and	do	?	''
And	I	had	to	quit	and	come	and	do	this	thing	called	A	Better	Place	.
We	then	decided	to	scale	it	up	.
We	went	to	other	countries	.	As	I	said	we	went	to	Denmark	.
And	Denmark	set	this	beautiful	policy	;	it	's	called	the	IQ	test	.
It	's	inversely	proportional	to	taxes	.
They	put	180	percent	tax	on	gasoline	cars
and	zero	tax	on	zero-emission	cars	.
So	if	you	want	to	buy	a	gasoline	car	in	Denmark	,	it	costs	you	about	60,000	Euros	.
If	you	buy	our	car	it	's	about	20,000	Euros	.
If	you	fail	the	IQ	test	they	ask	you	to	leave	the	country	.
We	then	were	sort	of	coined	as	the	guys	who	run	only	in	small	islands	.
I	know	most	people	do	n't	think	of	Israel	as	a	small	island	,
but	Israel	is	an	island	--	it	's	a	transportation	island	.
If	your	car	is	driving	outside	Israel	it	's	been	stolen	.
If	you	're	thinking	about	it	in	terms	of	islands	,	we	decided	to	go	to	the	biggest	island	that	we	could	find	,
and	that	was	Australia	.	The	third	country	we	announced	was	Australia	.
It	's	got	three	centers	--	in	Brisbane	,	in	Melbourne	,	in	Sydney	--	and	one	freeway	,	one	electric	freeway	that	connects	them	.
The	next	island	was	not	too	hard	to	find	,	and	that	was	Hawaii	.
We	decided	to	come	into	the	U.S.	and	pick	the	two	best	places	--	the	one	where	you	did	n't	need	any	range	extension	.
Hawaii	you	can	drive	around	the	island	on	one	battery	.
And	if	you	really	have	a	long	day	you	can	switch	,	and	keep	on	driving	around	the	island	.
The	second	one	was	the	San	Francisco	Bay	Area
where	Gavin	Newsom	created	a	beautiful	policy	across	all	the	mayors	.
He	decided	that	he	's	going	to	take	over	the	state	,	unofficially	,	and	then	officially	,
and	then	created	this	beautiful	Region	One	policy	.
In	the	San	Francisco	Bay	Area	not	only	do	you	have	the	highest	concentration	of	Priuses	,	but	you	also	have	the	perfect	range	extender	.
It	's	called	the	other	car	.
As	we	stared	scaling	it	up	we	looked	at	what	is	the	problem	to	come	up	to	the	U.S.	?
Why	is	this	a	big	issue	?
And	the	most	fascinating	thing	we	've	learned	is	that	,	when	you	have	small	problems	on	the	individual	level	,	like	the	price	of	gasoline	to	drive	every	morning	.
You	do	n't	notice	it	,	but	when	the	aggregate	comes	up	you	're	dead	.	Alright	?
So	the	price	of	oil	,	much	like	lots	of	other	curves	that	we	've	seen	,	goes	along	a	depletion	curve	.
The	foundation	of	this	curve	is	that	we	keep	losing	the	wells	that	are	close	to	the	ground	.
And	we	keep	getting	wells	that	are	farther	away	from	the	ground	.
It	becomes	more	and	more	and	more	expensive	to	dig	them	out	.
You	think	,	well	it	's	been	up	,	it	's	been	down	,	its	been	up	,	it	's	going	to	keep	on	going	up	and	down	.
Here	is	the	problem	:	at	147	dollars	a	barrel	,	which	we	were	in	six	months	ago	,	the	U.S.	spent	a	ton	of	money	to	get	oil	.
Then	we	lost	our	economy	and	we	went	back	down	to	47	--
sometimes	it	's	40	,	sometimes	it	's	50	.
Now	we	're	running	a	stimulus	package	.
It	's	called	the	trillion-dollar	stimulus	package	.
We	're	going	to	revive	the	economy	.	Hopefully	it	happens	between	now	and	2015	,	somewhere	in	that	space	.
What	happens	when	the	economy	recovers	?
By	2015	we	would	have	had	at	least	250	million	new	cars	even	at	the	pace	we	're	going	at	right	now	.
That	's	another	30	percent	demand	on	oil	.
That	is	another	25	million	barrels	a	day	.
That	's	all	the	U.S.	usage	today	.
In	other	words	at	some	point	when	we	've	recovered	we	go	up	to	the	peak	.
And	then	we	do	the	OPEC	stimulus	package	also	known	as	200	dollars	a	barrel	.
We	take	our	money	and	we	give	it	away	.
You	know	what	happens	at	that	point	?
We	go	back	down	.	It	's	going	to	go	up	and	down	.
And	the	downs	are	going	to	be	much	longer
and	the	ups	are	going	to	be	much	shorter	.
And	that	's	the	difference	between	problems	that	are	additive	,	like	CO2	,	which	we	go	slowly	up	and	then	we	tip	,	and	problems	that	are	depletive	,	in	which	we	lose	what	we	have	,	which	oscillate	,	and	they	oscillate	until	we	lose	everything	we	've	got	.
Now	we	actually	looked	at	what	the	answer	would	be	.
Right	?	Remember	in	the	campaign	:	one	million	hybrid	cars	by	2015	.
That	is	0.5	percent	of	the	U.S.	oil	consumption	.
That	is	oh	point	oh	well	percent	of	the	rest	of	the	world	.
That	wo	n't	do	much	difference	.
We	looked	at	an	MIT	study	:	ten	million	electric	cars	on	the	global	roads	.
Ten	million	out	of	500	million	we	will	add	between	now	and	then	.
That	is	the	most	pessimistic	number	you	can	have	.
It	's	also	the	most	optimistic	number
because	it	means	we	will	scale	this	industry	from	100	thousand	cars	is	2011	,	to	10	million	cars	by	2016	--	100	x	growth	in	less	than	five	years	.
You	have	to	remember	that	the	world	today	is	bringing	in	so	many	cars	.
We	have	10	million	cars	by	region	.
That	's	an	enormous	amount	of	cars	.
China	is	adding	those	cars	--	India	,	Russia	,	Brazil	.
We	have	all	these	regions	.
Europe	has	solved	it	.	They	just	put	a	tax	on	gasoline	.
They	'll	be	the	first	in	line	to	get	off
because	their	prices	are	high	.
China	solves	it	by	an	edict	.	At	some	point	they	'll	just	declare	that	no	gasoline	car	will	come	into	a	city	,	and	that	will	be	it	.
The	Indians	do	n't	even	understand	why	we	think	of	it	as	a	problem	because	most	people	in	India	fill	two	or	three	gallons	every	time	.
For	them	to	get	a	battery	that	goes	120	miles	is	an	extension	on	range	,	not	a	reduction	in	range	.
We	're	the	only	ones	who	do	n't	have	the	price	set	right	.
We	do	n't	have	the	industry	set	right	.
We	do	n't	have	any	incentive	to	go	and	resolve	it	across	the	U.S	.
Now	where	is	the	car	industry	on	that	?
Very	interesting	.	The	car	industry	has	been	focused	just	on	themselves	.
They	basically	looked	at	it	and	said	,	``	Car	1.0	we	'll	solve	everything	within	the	car	itself	.	''
No	infrastructure	,	no	problem	.
We	forgot	about	the	entire	chain	around	us	.
All	this	stuff	that	happens	around	.
We	are	looking	at	the	emergence	of	a	car	2.0	--	a	whole	new	market	,	a	whole	new	business	model	.
The	business	model	in	which	the	money	that	is	actually	coming	in	,	to	drive	the	car	--	the	minutes	,	the	miles	if	you	want	,	that	you	are	all	familiar	with	--	subsidize	the	price	of	the	car	,	just	like	cellphones	.	You	'll	pay	for	the	miles	.
And	some	of	it	will	go	back	to	the	car	maker	.
Some	of	it	will	go	back	to	your	own	pocket	.
But	our	cars	are	actually	going	to	be	cheaper	than	gasoline	cars	.
You	're	looking	at	a	world	where	cars	are	matched	with	windmills	.
In	Denmark	,	we	will	drive	all	the	cars	in	Denmark	from	windmills	,	not	from	oil	.
In	Israel	,	we	've	asked	to	put	a	solar	farm	in	the	south	of	Israel	.
And	people	said	,	``	Oh	that	's	a	very	very	large	space	that	you	're	asking	for	.	''
And	we	said	,	``	What	if	we	had	proven	that	in	the	same	space	we	found	oil	for	the	country	for	the	next	hundred	years	?	''
And	they	said	,	``	We	tried	.	There	is	n't	any	.	''
We	said	,	``	No	no	,	but	what	if	we	prove	it	?	''
And	they	said	,	``	Well	you	can	dig	.	''	And	we	decided	to	dig	up	,
instead	of	digging	down	.
These	are	perfect	matches	to	one	another	.
Now	all	you	need	is	about	10	percent	of	the	electricity	generated	.
Think	of	it	as	a	project	that	spans	over	about	10	years	.
That	's	one	percent	a	year	.
Now	when	we	're	looking	at	solving	big	problems	,	we	need	to	start	thinking	in	two	numbers	.
And	those	are	not	20	percent	by	2020	.
The	two	numbers	are	zero	--	as	in	zero	footprint	or	zero	oil	--
and	scale	it	infinity	.
And	when	we	go	to	COP15	at	the	end	of	this	year
we	ca	n't	stop	thinking	of	padding	CO2	.
We	have	to	start	thinking	about	giving	kickers	to	countries	that	are	willing	to	go	to	this	kind	of	scale	.
One	car	emits	four	tons	.
And	actually	700	and	change	million	cars	today	emit	2.8	billion	tons	of	CO2	.
That	's	,	in	the	additive	,	about	25	percent	of	our	problem	.
Cars	and	trucks	add	up	to	about	25	percent	of	the	world	's	CO2	emissions	.
We	have	to	come	and	attack	this	problem	with	a	focus	,	with	an	effort	that	actually	says	,	we	're	going	to	go	to	zero	before	the	world	ends	.
I	actually	shared	that	with	some	legislators	here	in	the	U.S	.
I	shared	it	with	a	gentleman	called	Bobby	Kennedy	Jr.	,	who	is	one	of	my	idols	.
I	told	him	one	of	the	reasons	that	his	uncle	was	remembered	is	because	he	said	we	're	going	to	send	a	man	to	the	moon	,	and	we	'll	do	it	by	the	end	of	the	decade	.
We	did	n't	say	we	're	going	to	send	a	man	20	percent	to	the	moon	.
And	there	will	be	about	a	20	percent	chance	we	'll	recover	him	.
He	actually	shared	with	me	another	story	,	which	is	from	about	200	years	ago	.
200	years	ago	,	in	Parliament	,	in	Great	Britain	,	there	was	a	long	argument
over	economy	versus	morality	.
25	percent	--	just	like	25	percent	emissions	today	comes	from	cars	--
25	percent	of	their	energy	for	the	entire	industrial	world	in	the	U.K.	came	from	a	source	of	energy	that	was	immoral	:	human	slaves	.
And	there	was	an	argument	.	Should	we	stop	using	slaves	?
And	what	would	it	do	to	our	economy	?
And	people	said	,	``	Well	we	need	to	take	time	to	do	it	.
Let	's	not	do	it	immediately	.	Maybe	we	free	the	kids
and	keep	the	slaves	.
And	after	a	month	of	arguments	they	decided	to	stop	slavery	,
and	the	industrial	revolution	started	within	less	than	one	year	.
And	the	U.K.	had	100	years	of	economic	growth	.
We	have	to	make	the	right	moral	decision	.
We	have	to	make	it	immediately	.
We	need	to	have	presidential	leadership
just	like	we	had	in	Israel	that	said	we	will	end	oil	.
And	we	need	to	do	it	not	within	20	years	or	50	years	,	but	within	this	presidential	term
because	if	we	do	n't	,	we	will	lose	our	economy	,	right	after	we	'd	lost	our	morality	.
Thank	you	all	very	much	.
That	splendid	music	,	the	coming-in	music	--	``	The	Elephant	March	''	from	``	Aida	''	--	is	the	music	I	've	chosen	for	my	funeral	--	--	and	you	can	see	why	.	It	's	triumphal	.
I	wo	n't	feel	anything	,	but	if	I	could	,	I	would	feel	triumphal	at	having	lived	at	all	,	and	at	having	lived	on	this	splendid	planet	,	and	having	been	given	the	opportunity	to	understand	something	about	why	I	was	here	in	the	first	place	,	before	not	being	here	.
Can	you	understand	my	quaint	English	accent	?
Like	everybody	else	,	I	was	entranced	yesterday	by	the	animal	session	.
Robert	Full	and	Frans	Lanting	and	others	--	the	beauty	of	the	things	they	showed	.
The	only	slight	jarring	note	was	when	Jeffrey	Katzenberg	said	of	the	mustang	,	``	the	most	splendid	creatures	that	God	put	on	this	earth	.	''	Now	of	course	,	we	know	that	he	did	n't	really	mean	that	,	but	in	this	country	at	the	moment	,	you	ca	n't	be	too	careful	.
I	'm	a	biologist	,	and	the	central	theorem	of	our	subject	:	the	theory	of	design	,	Darwin	's	theory	of	evolution	by	natural	selection	.
In	professional	circles	everywhere	,	it	's	of	course	universally	accepted	.
In	non-professional	circles	outside	America	,	it	's	largely	ignored	.
But	in	non-professional	circles	within	America	,	it	arouses	so	much	hostility	--	--	that	it	's	fair	to	say	that	American	biologists	are	in	a	state	of	war	.
The	war	is	so	worrying	at	present	,	with	court	cases	coming	up	in	one	state	after	another	,	that	I	felt	I	had	to	say	something	about	it	.
If	you	want	to	know	what	I	have	to	say	about	Darwinism	itself	,	I	'm	afraid	you	're	going	to	have	to	look	at	my	books	,	which	you	wo	n't	find	in	the	bookstore	outside	.
Contemporary	court	cases	often	concern	an	allegedly	new	version	of	creationism	,	called	``	Intelligent	Design	,	''	or	ID	.
Do	n't	be	fooled	.	There	's	nothing	new	about	ID	.
It	's	just	creationism	under	another	name	,	rechristened	--	I	choose	the	word	advisedly	--	--	for	tactical	,	political	reasons	.
The	arguments	of	so-called	ID	theorists	are	the	same	old	arguments	that	had	been	refuted	again	and	again	,	since	Darwin	down	to	the	present	day	.
There	is	an	effective	evolution	lobby	coordinating	the	fight	on	behalf	of	science	,	and	I	try	to	do	all	I	can	to	help	them	,	but	they	get	quite	upset	when	people	like	me	dare	to	mention	that	we	happen	to	be	atheists	as	well	as	evolutionists	.
They	see	us	as	rocking	the	boat	,	and	you	can	understand	why	.
Creationists	,	lacking	any	coherent	scientific	argument	for	their	case	,	fall	back	on	the	popular	phobia	against	atheism	.
Teach	your	children	evolution	in	biology	class	,	and	they	'll	soon	move	on	to	drugs	,	grand	larceny	and	sexual	pre-version	.
In	fact	,	of	course	,	educated	theologians	from	the	Pope	down	are	firm	in	their	support	of	evolution	.
This	book	,	``	Finding	Darwin	's	God	,	''	by	Kenneth	Miller	,	is	one	of	the	most	effective	attacks	on	Intelligent	Design	that	I	know	,	and	it	's	all	the	more	effective	because	it	's	written	by	a	devout	Christian	.
People	like	Kenneth	Miller	could	be	called	a	``	godsend	''	to	the	evolution	lobby	--	--	because	they	expose	the	lie	that	evolutionism	is	,	as	a	matter	of	fact	,	tantamount	to	atheism	.	People	like	me	,	on	the	other	hand	,	rock	the	boat	.
But	here	,	I	want	to	say	something	nice	about	creationists	.
It	's	not	a	thing	I	often	do	,	so	listen	carefully	.
I	think	they	're	right	about	one	thing	.
I	think	they	're	right	that	evolution	is	fundamentally	hostile	to	religion	.
I	've	already	said	that	many	individual	evolutionists	,	like	the	Pope	,	are	also	religious	,	but	I	think	they	're	deluding	themselves	.
I	believe	a	true	understanding	of	Darwinism	is	deeply	corrosive	to	religious	faith	.
Now	,	it	may	sound	as	though	I	'm	about	to	preach	atheism	,	and	I	want	to	reassure	you	that	that	's	not	what	I	'm	going	to	do	.
In	an	audience	as	sophisticated	as	this	one	,	that	would	be	preaching	to	the	choir	.
No	,	what	I	want	to	urge	upon	you	--
--	instead	what	I	want	to	urge	upon	you	is	militant	atheism	.
But	that	's	putting	it	too	negatively	.
If	I	was	a	person	who	were	interested	in	preserving	religious	faith	,	I	would	be	very	afraid	of	the	positive	power	of	evolutionary	science	,	and	indeed	science	generally	,	but	evolution	in	particular	,	to	inspire	and	enthrall	,	precisely	because	it	is	atheistic	.
Now	,	the	difficult	problem	for	any	theory	of	biological	design	is	to	explain	the	massive	statistical	improbability	of	living	things	.
Statistical	improbability	in	the	direction	of	good	design	--	``	complexity	''	is	another	word	for	this	.
The	standard	creationist	argument	--	there	is	only	one	;	they	all	reduce	to	this	one	--	takes	off	from	a	statistical	improbability	.
Living	creatures	are	too	complex	to	have	come	about	by	chance	;	therefore	,	they	must	have	had	a	designer	.
This	argument	of	course	,	shoots	itself	in	the	foot	.
Any	designer	capable	of	designing	something	really	complex	has	to	be	even	more	complex	himself	,	and	that	's	before	we	even	start	on	the	other	things	he	's	expected	to	do	,	like	forgive	sins	,	bless	marriages	,	listen	to	prayers	--
favor	our	side	in	a	war	--
--	disapprove	of	our	sex	lives	and	so	on	.
Complexity	is	the	problem	that	any	theory	of	biology	has	to	solve	,	and	you	ca	n't	solve	it	by	postulating	an	agent	that	is	even	more	complex	,	thereby	simply	compounding	the	problem	.
Darwinian	natural	selection	is	so	stunningly	elegant	because	it	solves	the	problem	of	explaining	complexity	in	terms	of	nothing	but	simplicity	.
Essentially	,	it	does	it	by	providing	a	smooth	ramp	of	gradual	step-by-step	increment	.
But	here	,	I	only	want	to	make	the	point	that	the	elegance	of	Darwinism	is	corrosive	to	religion	precisely	because	it	is	so	elegant	,	so	parsimonious	,	so	powerful	,	so	economically	powerful	.
It	has	the	sinewy	economy	of	a	beautiful	suspension	bridge	.
The	God	theory	is	not	just	a	bad	theory	.
It	turns	out	to	be	,	in	principle	,	incapable	of	doing	the	job	required	of	it	.
So	,	returning	to	tactics	and	the	evolution	lobby	,	I	want	to	argue	that	rocking	the	boat	may	be	just	the	right	thing	to	do	.
My	approach	to	attacking	creationism	is	unlike	the	evolution	lobby	.
My	approach	to	attacking	creationism	is	to	attack	religion	as	a	whole	,	and	at	this	point	I	need	to	acknowledge	the	remarkable	taboo	against	speaking	ill	of	religion	,
and	I	'm	going	to	do	so	in	the	words	of	the	late	Douglas	Adams	,	a	dear	friend	who	,	if	he	never	came	to	TED	,	certainly	should	have	been	invited	.
Richard	Dawkins	:	He	was	.	Good	.	I	thought	he	must	have	been	.
He	begins	this	speech	which	was	tape-recorded	in	Cambridge	shortly	before	he	died	.
He	begins	by	explaining	how	science	works	through	the	testing	of	hypotheses	that	are	framed	to	be	vulnerable	to	disproof	,	and	then	he	goes	on	.
I	quote	,	``	Religion	does	n't	seem	to	work	like	that	.
It	has	certain	ideas	at	the	heart	of	it	,	which	we	call	'sacred	'	or	'holy	.	'	What	it	means	is	:	here	is	an	idea	or	a	notion	that	you	're	not	allowed	to	say	anything	bad	about	.
You	're	just	not	.	Why	not	?	Because	you	're	not	.
Why	should	it	be	that	it	's	perfectly	legitimate	to	support	the	Republicans	or	Democrats	,	this	model	of	economics	versus	that	,	Macintosh	instead	of	Windows	,	but	to	have	an	opinion	about	how	the	universe	began	,	about	who	created	the	universe	--	no	,	that	's	holy	.
So	,	we	're	used	to	not	challenging	religious	ideas	and	it	's	very	interesting	how	much	of	a	furor	Richard	creates	when	he	does	it	.	''	He	meant	me	,	not	that	one	.
``	Everybody	gets	absolutely	frantic	about	it	,	because	you	're	not	allowed	to	say	these	things	,	yet	when	you	look	at	it	rationally	,	there	is	no	reason	why	those	ideas	should	n't	be	as	open	to	debate	as	any	other	,	except	that	we	've	agreed	somehow	between	us	that	they	should	n't	be	.	''	And	that	's	the	end	of	the	quote	from	Douglas	.
In	my	view	,	not	only	is	science	corrosive	to	religion	;	religion	is	corrosive	to	science	.
It	teaches	people	to	be	satisfied	with	trivial	,	supernatural	non-explanations	and	blinds	them	to	the	wonderful	real	explanations	that	we	have	within	our	grasp	.
It	teaches	them	to	accept	authority	,	revelation	and	faith	instead	of	always	insisting	on	evidence	.
There	's	Douglas	Adams	,	magnificent	picture	from	his	book	,	``	Last	Chance	to	See	.	''
Now	,	there	's	a	typical	scientific	journal	,	the	Quarterly	Review	of	Biology	.
And	I	'm	going	to	put	together	,	as	guest	editor	,	a	special	issue	on	the	question	,	``	Did	an	asteroid	kill	the	dinosaurs	?	''
And	the	first	paper	is	a	standard	scientific	paper	presenting	evidence	,	``	Iridium	Layer	at	the	K-T	Boundary	,	Potassium-Argon	Dated	Crater	in	Yucatan	,	Indicate	That	an	Asteroid	Killed	the	Dinosaurs	.	''
Perfectly	ordinary	scientific	paper	.
Now	,	the	next	one	,	``	The	President	of	The	Royal	Society	Has	Been	Vouchsafed	a	Strong	Inner	Conviction	''	--	--	``	...	That	an	Asteroid	Killed	the	Dinosaurs	.	''
``	It	Has	Been	Privately	Revealed	to	Professor	Huxtane	That	an	Asteroid	Killed	the	Dinosaurs	.	''
``	Professor	Hordley	Was	Brought	Up	to	Have	Total	and	Unquestioning	Faith	''	--	--	``	...	That	an	Asteroid	Killed	the	Dinosaurs	.	''
``	Professor	Hawkins	Has	Promulgated	an	Official	Dogma	Binding	on	All	Loyal	Hawkinsians	That	an	Asteroid	Killed	the	Dinosaurs	.	''
That	's	inconceivable	,	of	course	.
But	suppose	--
--	in	1987	,	a	reporter	asked	George	Bush	,	Sr.	whether	he	recognized	the	equal	citizenship	and	patriotism	of	Americans	who	are	atheists	.
Mr.	Bush	's	reply	has	become	infamous	.
``	No	,	I	do	n't	know	that	atheists	should	be	considered	citizens	,	nor	should	they	be	considered	patriots	.
This	is	one	nation	under	God	.	''	Bush	's	bigotry	was	not	an	isolated	mistake	,	blurted	out	in	the	heat	of	the	moment	and	later	retracted	.
He	stood	by	it	in	the	face	of	repeated	calls	for	clarification	or	withdrawal	.
He	really	meant	it	.
More	to	the	point	,	he	knew	it	posed	no	threat	to	his	election	,	quite	the	contrary	.
Democrats	as	well	as	Republicans	parade	their	religiousness	if	they	want	to	get	elected	.	Both	parties	invoke	``	one	nation	under	God	.	''
What	would	Thomas	Jefferson	have	said	?
Incidentally	,	I	'm	not	usually	very	proud	of	being	British	,	but	you	ca	n't	help	making	the	comparison	.
In	practice	,	what	is	an	atheist	?
An	atheist	is	just	somebody	who	feels	about	Yahweh	the	way	any	decent	Christian	feels	about	Thor	or	Baal	or	the	golden	calf	.
As	has	been	said	before	,	we	are	all	atheists	about	most	of	the	gods	that	humanity	has	ever	believed	in	.	Some	of	us	just	go	one	god	further	.
And	however	we	define	atheism	,	it	's	surely	the	kind	of	academic	belief	that	a	person	is	entitled	to	hold	without	being	vilified	as	an	unpatriotic	,	unelectable	non-citizen	.
Nevertheless	,	it	's	an	undeniable	fact	that	to	own	up	to	being	an	atheist	is	tantamount	to	introducing	yourself	as	Mr.	Hitler	or	Miss	Beelzebub	.
And	that	all	stems	from	the	perception	of	atheists	as	some	kind	of	weird	,	way-out	minority	.
Natalie	Angier	wrote	a	rather	sad	piece	in	the	New	Yorker	,	saying	how	lonely	she	felt	as	an	atheist	.
She	clearly	feels	in	a	beleaguered	minority	,	but	actually	,	how	do	American	atheists	stack	up	numerically	?
The	latest	survey	makes	surprisingly	encouraging	reading	.
Christianity	,	of	course	,	takes	a	massive	lion	's	share	of	the	population	,	with	nearly	160	million	.
But	what	would	you	think	was	the	second	largest	group	,	convincingly	outnumbering	Jews	with	2.8	million	,	Muslims	at	1.1	million	,	and	Hindus	,	Buddhists	and	all	other	religions	put	together	?
The	second	largest	group	,	of	nearly	30	million	,	is	the	one	described	as	non-religious	or	secular	.
You	ca	n't	help	wondering	why	vote-seeking	politicians	are	so	proverbially	overawed	by	the	power	of	,	for	example	,	the	Jewish	lobby	.
The	state	of	Israel	seems	to	owe	its	very	existence	to	the	American	Jewish	vote	,	while	at	the	same	time	consigning	the	non-religious	to	political	oblivion	.
This	secular	non-religious	vote	,	if	properly	mobilized	,	is	nine	times	as	numerous	as	the	Jewish	vote	.
Why	does	this	far	more	substantial	minority	not	make	a	move	to	exercise	its	political	muscle	?
Well	,	so	much	for	quantity	.	How	about	quality	?
Is	there	any	correlation	,	positive	or	negative	,	between	intelligence	and	tendency	to	be	religious	?
The	survey	that	I	quoted	,	which	is	the	ARIS	survey	,	did	n't	break	down	its	data	by	socio-economic	class	or	education	,	IQ	or	anything	else	.
But	a	recent	article	by	Paul	G.	Bell	in	the	Mensa	magazine	provides	some	straws	in	the	wind	.
Mensa	,	as	you	know	,	is	an	international	organization	for	people	with	very	high	IQ	.
And	from	a	meta-analysis	of	the	literature	,	Bell	concludes	that	,	I	quote	,	``	Of	43	studies	carried	out	since	1927	on	the	relationship	between	religious	belief	and	one	's	intelligence	or	educational	level	,	all	but	four	found	an	inverse	connection	.
That	is	,	the	higher	one	's	intelligence	or	educational	level	,	the	less	one	is	likely	to	be	religious	.	''
Well	,	I	have	n't	seen	the	original	42	studies	and	I	ca	n't	comment	on	that	meta-anaysis	but	I	would	like	to	see	more	studies	done	along	those	lines	.
And	I	know	that	there	are	,	if	I	could	put	a	little	plug	here	,	there	are	people	in	this	audience	easily	capable	of	financing	a	massive	research	survey	to	settle	the	question	,	and	I	put	the	suggestion	up	--	for	what	it	's	worth	.
But	let	me	know	show	you	some	data	that	have	been	properly	published	and	analyzed	on	one	special	group	,	namely	,	top	scientists	.
In	1998	,	Larson	and	Witham	polled	the	cream	of	American	scientists	,	those	who	'd	been	honored	by	election	to	the	National	Academy	of	Sciences	,	and	among	this	select	group	,	belief	in	a	personal	God	dropped	to	a	shattering	seven	percent	.
About	20	percent	are	agnostic	,	and	the	rest	could	fairly	be	called	atheists	.
Similar	figures	obtained	for	belief	in	personal	immortality	.
Among	biological	scientists	,	the	figures	are	even	lower	:	5.5	percent	,	only	,	believe	in	God	.	Physical	scientists	:	it	's	7.5	percent	.
I	've	not	seen	corresponding	figures	for	elite	scholars	in	other	fields	,	such	history	or	philosophy	,	but	I	'd	be	surprised	if	they	were	different	.
So	,	we	've	reached	a	truly	remarkable	situation	,	a	grotesque	mismatch	between	the	American	intelligentsia	and	the	American	electorate	.
A	philosophical	opinion	about	the	nature	of	the	universe	,	which	is	held	by	the	vast	majority	of	top	American	scientists	and	probably	the	majority	of	the	intelligentsia	generally	,	is	so	abhorrent	to	the	American	electorate	that	no	candidate	for	popular	election	dare	affirm	it	in	public	.
If	I	'm	right	,	this	means	that	high	office	in	the	greatest	country	in	the	world	is	barred	to	the	very	people	best	qualified	to	hold	it	--	the	intelligentsia	--	unless	they	are	prepared	to	lie	about	their	beliefs	.
To	put	it	bluntly	,	American	political	opportunities	are	heavily	loaded	against	those	who	are	simultaneously	intelligent	and	honest	.
I	'm	not	a	citizen	of	this	country	,	so	I	hope	it	wo	n't	be	thought	unbecoming	if	I	suggest	that	something	needs	to	be	done	.
And	I	've	already	hinted	what	that	something	is	.
From	what	I	've	seen	of	TED	,	I	think	this	may	be	the	ideal	place	to	launch	it	.
Again	,	I	fear	it	will	cost	money	.
We	need	a	consciousness-raising	,	coming-out	campaign	for	American	atheists	.
This	could	be	similar	to	the	campaign	organized	by	homosexuals	a	few	years	ago	,	although	heaven	forbid	that	we	should	stoop	to	public	outing	of	people	against	their	will	.
In	most	cases	,	people	who	out	themselves	will	help	to	destroy	the	myth	that	there	is	something	wrong	with	atheists	.
On	the	contrary	,	they	'll	demonstrate	that	atheists	are	often	the	kinds	of	people	that	could	serve	as	decent	role	models	for	your	children	,
the	kinds	of	people	an	advertising	agent	could	use	to	recommend	a	product	,
the	kinds	of	people	who	are	sitting	in	this	room	.
There	should	be	a	snowball	effect	,	a	positive	feedback	,	such	that	the	more	names	we	have	,	the	more	we	get	.
There	could	be	non-linearities	,	threshold	effects	.
When	a	critical	mass	has	been	attained	,	there	's	an	abrupt	acceleration	in	recruitment	.
And	again	,	it	will	need	money	.
I	suspect	that	the	word	``	atheist	''	itself	contains	or	remains	a	stumbling	block	far	out	of	proportion	to	what	it	actually	means	,	and	a	stumbling	block	to	people	who	otherwise	might	be	happy	to	out	themselves	.
So	,	what	other	words	might	be	used	to	smooth	the	path	,	oil	the	wheels	,	sugar	the	pill	?	Darwin	himself	preferred	``	agnostic	''	--	and	not	only	out	of	loyalty	to	his	friend	Huxley	,	who	coined	the	term	.
Darwin	said	,	``	I	have	never	been	an	atheist	in	the	same	sense	of	denying	the	existence	of	a	God	.
I	think	that	generally	an	'agnostic	'	would	be	the	most	correct	description	of	my	state	of	mind	.	''
He	even	became	uncharacteristically	tetchy	with	Edward	Aveling	.
Aveling	was	a	militant	atheist	who	failed	to	persuade	Darwin	to	accept	the	dedication	of	his	book	on	atheism	--	incidentally	,	giving	rise	to	a	fascinating	myth	that	Karl	Marx	tried	to	dedicate	``	Das	Kapital	''	to	Darwin	,	which	he	did	n't	.	It	was	actually	Edward	Aveling	.
What	happened	was	that	Aveling	's	mistress	was	Marx	's	daughter	,	and	when	both	Darwin	and	Marx	were	dead	,	Marx	's	papers	became	muddled	up	with	Aveling	's	papers	and	a	letter	from	Darwin	saying	,	``	My	dear	sir	,	thank	you	very	much	but	I	do	n't	want	you	to	dedicate	your	book	to	me	,	''	was	mistakenly	supposed	to	be	addressed	to	Marx	,	and	that	gave	rise	to	this	whole	myth	,	which	you	've	probably	heard	.
It	's	a	sort	of	urban	myth	,	that	Marx	tried	to	dedicate	``	Kapital	''	to	Darwin	.
Anyway	,	it	was	Aveling	,	and	when	they	met	,	Darwin	challenged	Aveling	,	``	Why	do	you	call	yourselves	atheists	?	''
``	'Agnostic	,	'	''	retorted	Aveling	,	``	was	simply	'atheist	'	writ	respectable	,	and	'atheist	'	was	simply	'agnostic	'	writ	aggressive	.	''
Darwin	complained	,	``	But	why	should	you	be	so	aggressive	?	''
Darwin	thought	that	atheism	might	be	well	and	good	for	the	intelligentsia	,	but	that	ordinary	people	were	not	,	quote	,	``	ripe	for	it	.	''
Which	is	,	of	course	,	our	old	friend	,	the	``	do	n't	rock	the	boat	''	argument	.
It	's	not	recorded	whether	Aveling	told	Darwin	to	come	down	off	his	high	horse	.
But	in	any	case	,	that	was	more	than	100	years	ago	.	You	think	we	might	have	grown	up	since	then	.
Now	,	a	friend	,	an	intelligent	lapsed	Jew	,	who	incidentally	observed	the	Sabbath	for	reasons	of	cultural	solidarity	,	describes	himself	as	a	``	tooth	fairy	agnostic	.	''
He	wo	n't	call	himself	an	atheist	because	it	's	,	in	principle	,	impossible	to	prove	a	negative	,	but	agnostic	on	its	own	might	suggest	that	God	's	existence	was	therefore	on	equal	terms	of	likelihood	as	his	non-existence	.
So	,	my	friend	is	strictly	agnostic	about	the	tooth	fairy	,	but	it	is	n't	very	likely	,	is	it	?	Like	God	.
Hence	the	phrase	,	``	tooth	fairy	agnostic	.	''	Bertrand	Russell	made	the	same	point	using	a	hypothetical	teapot	in	orbit	about	Mars	.
You	would	strictly	have	to	be	agnostic	about	whether	there	is	a	teapot	in	orbit	about	Mars	,	but	that	does	n't	mean	you	treat	the	likelihood	of	its	existence	as	on	all	fours	with	its	non-existence	.
The	list	of	things	which	we	strictly	have	to	be	agnostic	about	does	n't	stop	at	tooth	fairies	and	teapots	.	It	's	infinite	.
If	you	want	to	believe	one	particular	one	of	them	--	unicorns	or	tooth	fairies	or	teapots	or	Yahweh	--	the	onus	is	on	you	to	say	why	.
The	onus	is	not	on	the	rest	of	us	to	say	why	not	.
We	,	who	are	atheists	,	are	also	a-fairiests	and	a-teapotists	.
But	we	do	n't	bother	to	say	so	,	and	this	is	why	my	friend	uses	``	tooth	fairy	agnostic	''	as	a	label	for	what	most	people	would	call	atheist	.
Nonetheless	,	if	we	want	to	attract	deep	down	atheists	to	come	out	publicly	,	we	're	going	to	have	find	something	better	to	stick	on	our	banner	than	``	tooth	fairy	''	or	``	teapot	agnostic	.	''
So	,	how	about	``	humanist	''	?
This	has	the	advantage	of	a	worldwide	network	of	well-organized	associations	and	journals	and	things	already	in	place	.
My	problem	with	it	only	is	its	apparent	anthropocentrism	.
One	of	the	things	we	've	learned	from	Darwin	is	that	the	human	species	is	only	one	among	millions	of	cousins	,	some	close	,	some	distant	.
And	there	are	other	possibilities	like	``	naturalist	,	''
but	that	also	has	problems	of	confusion	,	because	Darwin	would	have	thought	naturalist	--	``	naturalist	''	means	,	of	course	,	as	opposed	to	``	supernaturalist	''	--
and	it	is	used	sometimes	--
Darwin	would	have	been	confused	by	the	other	sense	of	``	naturalist	,	''	which	he	was	,	of	course	,	and	I	suppose	there	might	be	others	who	would	confuse	it	with	nudism	.
Such	people	might	be	those	belonging	to	the	British	lynch	mob	which	last	year	attacked	a	pediatrician	in	mistake	for	a	pedophile	.
I	think	the	best	of	the	available	alternatives	for	``	atheist	''	is	simply	``	non-theist	.	''
It	lacks	the	strong	connotation	that	there	's	definitely	no	God	,	and	it	could	therefore	easily	be	embraced	by	teapot	or	tooth	fairy	agnostics	.
It	's	completely	compatible	with	the	God	of	the	physicists	.
When	atheists	like	Stephen	Hawking	and	Albert	Einstein	use	the	word	``	God	,	''	they	use	it	of	course	as	a	metaphorical	shorthand	for	that	deep	,	mysterious	part	of	physics	which	we	do	n't	yet	understand	.
``	Non-theist	''	will	do	for	all	that	,	yet	unlike	``	atheist	,	''	it	does	n't	have	the	same	phobic	,	hysterical	responses	.
But	I	think	,	actually	,	the	alternative	is	to	grasp	the	nettle	of	the	word	``	atheism	''	itself	,	precisely	because	it	is	a	taboo	word	carrying	frissons	of	hysterical	phobia	.
Critical	mass	may	be	harder	to	achieve	with	the	word	``	atheist	''	than	with	the	word	``	non-theist	,	''	or	some	other	non-confrontational	word	.
But	if	we	did	achieve	it	with	that	dread	word	--	``	atheist	''	itself	--	the	political	impact	would	be	even	greater	.
Now	,	I	said	that	if	I	were	religious	,	I	'd	be	very	afraid	of	evolution	.	I	'd	go	further	.
I	would	fear	science	in	general	if	properly	understood	.
And	this	is	because	the	scientific	worldview	is	so	much	more	exciting	,	more	poetic	,	more	filled	with	sheer	wonder	than	anything	in	the	poverty-stricken	arsenals	of	the	religious	imagination	.
As	Carl	Sagan	,	another	recently	dead	hero	,	put	it	,	``	How	is	it	that	hardly	any	major	religion	has	looked	at	science	and	concluded	,	'This	is	better	than	we	thought	!
The	universe	is	much	bigger	than	our	prophet	said	,	grander	,	more	subtle	,	more	elegant	?	'	Instead	they	say	,	'No	,	no	,	no	!
My	god	is	a	little	god	,	and	I	want	him	to	stay	that	way	.	'
A	religion	,	old	or	new	,	that	stressed	the	magnificence	of	the	universe	as	revealed	by	modern	science	might	be	able	to	draw	forth	reserves	of	reverence	and	awe	hardly	tapped	by	the	conventional	faiths	.	''
Now	,	this	is	an	elite	audience	,	and	I	would	therefore	expect	about	10	percent	of	you	to	be	religious	.
Many	of	you	probably	subscribe	to	our	polite	cultural	belief	that	we	should	respect	religion	,	but	I	also	suspect	that	a	fair	number	of	those	secretly	despise	religion	as	much	as	I	do	.
If	you	're	one	of	them	,	and	of	course	many	of	you	may	not	be	,	but	if	you	are	one	of	them	,	I	'm	asking	you	to	stop	being	polite	,	come	out	and	say	so	,	and	if	you	happen	to	be	rich	,	give	some	thought	to	ways	in	which	you	might	make	a	difference	.
The	religious	lobby	in	this	country	is	massively	financed	by	foundations	--	to	say	nothing	of	all	the	tax	benefits	--	by	foundations	such	as	the	Templeton	Foundation	and	the	Discovery	Institute	.
We	need	an	anti-Templeton	to	step	forward	.
If	my	books	sold	as	well	as	Stephen	Hawking	's	books	,	instead	of	only	as	well	as	Richard	Dawkins	'	books	,	I	'd	do	it	myself	.
People	are	always	going	on	about	,	``	How	did	September	the	11th	change	you	?	''
Well	,	here	's	how	it	changed	me	.
Let	's	all	stop	being	so	damned	respectful	.
Thank	you	very	much	.
Thank	you	very	much	,	Chris	.	Everybody	who	came	up	here	said	they	were	scared	.	I	do	n't	know	if	I	'm	scared	,	but	this	is	my	first	time	of	addressing	an	audience	like	this	.
And	I	do	n't	have	any	smart	technology	for	you	to	look	at	.
There	are	no	slides	,	so	you	'll	just	have	to	be	content	with	me	.
What	I	want	to	do	this	morning	is	share	with	you	a	couple	of	stories	and	talk	about	a	different	Africa	.
Already	this	morning	there	were	some	allusions	to	the	Africa	that	you	hear	about	all	the	time	:	the	Africa	of	HIV/AIDS	,	the	Africa	of	malaria	,	the	Africa	of	poverty	,	the	Africa	of	conflict	,	and	the	Africa	of	disasters	.
While	it	is	true	that	those	things	are	going	on	,	there	's	an	Africa	that	you	do	n't	hear	about	very	much	.
And	sometimes	I	'm	puzzled	,	and	I	ask	myself	why	.
This	is	the	Africa	that	is	changing	,	that	Chris	alluded	to	.
This	is	the	Africa	of	opportunity	.
This	is	the	Africa	where	people	want	to	take	charge	of	their	own	futures	and	their	own	destinies	.
And	this	is	the	Africa	where	people	are	looking	for	partnerships	to	do	this	.	That	's	what	I	want	to	talk	about	today	.
And	I	want	to	start	by	telling	you	a	story	about	that	change	in	Africa	.
On	15th	of	September	2005	,	Mr.	Diepreye	Alamieyeseigha	,	a	governor	of	one	of	the	oil-rich	states	of	Nigeria	,	was	arrested	by	the	London	Metropolitan	Police	on	a	visit	to	London	.
He	was	arrested	because	there	were	transfers	of	eight	million	dollars	that	went	into	some	dormant	accounts	that	belonged	to	him	and	his	family	.
This	arrest	occurred	because	there	was	cooperation	between	the	London	Metropolitan	Police	and	the	Economic	and	Financial	Crimes	Commission	of	Nigeria	--	led	by	one	of	our	most	able	and	courageous	people	:	Mr.	Nuhu	Ribadu	.
Alamieyeseigha	was	arraigned	in	London	.
Due	to	some	slip-ups	,	he	managed	to	escape	dressed	as	a	woman	and	ran	from	London	back	to	Nigeria	where	,	according	to	our	constitution	,	those	in	office	as	governors	,	president	--	as	in	many	countries	--	have	immunity	and	can	not	be	prosecuted	.	But	what	happened	:	people	were	so	outraged	by	this	behavior	that	it	was	possible	for	his	state	legislature	to	impeach	him	and	get	him	out	of	office	.
Today	,	Alams	--	as	we	call	him	for	short	--	is	in	jail	.
This	is	a	story	about	the	fact	that	people	in	Africa	are	no	longer	willing	to	tolerate	corruption	from	their	leaders	.
This	is	a	story	about	the	fact	that	people	want	their	resources	managed	properly	for	their	good	,	and	not	taken	out	to	places	where	they	'll	benefit	just	a	few	of	the	elite	.
And	therefore	,	when	you	hear	about	the	corrupt	Africa	--	corruption	all	the	time	--	I	want	you	to	know	that	the	people	and	the	governments	are	trying	hard	to	fight	this	in	some	of	the	countries	,	and	that	some	successes	are	emerging	.
Does	it	mean	the	problem	is	over	?	The	answer	is	no	.
There	's	still	a	long	way	to	go	,	but	that	there	's	a	will	there	.
And	that	successes	are	being	chalked	up	on	this	very	important	fight	.
So	when	you	hear	about	corruption	,	do	n't	just	feel	that	nothing	is	being	done	about	this	--	that	you	ca	n't	operate	in	any	African	country	because	of	the	overwhelming	corruption	.	That	is	not	the	case	.
There	's	a	will	to	fight	,	and	in	many	countries	,	that	fight	is	ongoing	and	is	being	won	.	In	others	,	like	mine	,	where	there	has	been	a	long	history	of	dictatorship	in	Nigeria	,	the	fight	is	ongoing	and	we	have	a	long	way	to	go	.
But	the	truth	of	the	matter	is	that	this	is	going	on	.
The	results	are	showing	:	independent	monitoring	by	the	World	Bank	and	other	organizations	show	that	in	many	instances	the	trend	is	downwards	in	terms	of	corruption	,	and	governance	is	improving	.
A	study	by	the	Economic	Commission	for	Africa	showed	a	clear	trend	upwards	in	governance	in	28	African	countries	.
And	let	me	say	just	one	more	thing	before	I	leave	this	area	of	governance	.
That	is	that	people	talk	about	corruption	,	corruption	.
All	the	time	when	they	talk	about	it	you	immediately	think	about	Africa	.
That	's	the	image	:	African	countries	.	But	let	me	say	this	:	if	Alams	was	able	to	export	eight	million	dollars	into	an	account	in	London	--	if	the	other	people	who	had	taken	money	,	estimated	at	20	to	40	billion	now	of	developing	countries	'	monies	sitting	abroad	in	the	developed	countries	--	if	they	're	able	to	do	this	,	what	is	that	?	Is	that	not	corruption	?
In	this	country	,	if	you	receive	stolen	goods	,	are	you	not	prosecuted	?
So	when	we	talk	about	this	kind	of	corruption	,	let	us	also	think	about	what	is	happening	on	the	other	side	of	the	globe	--	where	the	money	's	going	and	what	can	be	done	to	stop	it	.
I	'm	working	on	an	initiative	now	,	along	with	the	World	Bank	,	on	asset	recovery	,	trying	to	do	what	we	can	to	get	the	monies	that	have	been	taken	abroad	--	developing	countries	'	moneys	--	to	get	that	sent	back	.
Because	if	we	can	get	the	20	billion	dollars	sitting	out	there	back	,	it	may	be	far	more	for	some	of	these	countries	than	all	the	aid	that	is	being	put	together	.
The	second	thing	I	want	to	talk	about	is	the	will	for	reform	.
Africans	,	after	--	they	're	tired	,	we	're	tired	of	being	the	subject	of	everybody	's	charity	and	care	.
We	are	grateful	,	but	we	know	that	we	can	take	charge	of	our	own	destinies	if	we	have	the	will	to	reform	.
And	what	is	happening	in	many	African	countries	now	is	a	realization	that	no	one	can	do	it	but	us	.	We	have	to	do	it	.
We	can	invite	partners	who	can	support	us	,	but	we	have	to	start	.
We	have	to	reform	our	economies	,	change	our	leadership	,	become	more	democratic	,	be	more	open	to	change	and	to	information	.
And	this	is	what	we	started	to	do	in	one	of	the	largest	countries	on	the	continent	,	Nigeria	.
In	fact	,	if	you	're	not	in	Nigeria	,	you	're	not	in	Africa	.
I	want	to	tell	you	that	.
One	in	four	sub-Saharan	Africans	is	Nigerian	,	and	it	has	140	million	dynamic	people	--	chaotic	people	--	but	very	interesting	people	.	You	'll	never	be	bored	.
What	we	started	to	do	was	to	realize	that	we	had	to	take	charge	and	reform	ourselves	.
And	with	the	support	of	a	leader	who	was	willing	,	at	the	time	,	to	do	the	reforms	,	we	put	forward	a	comprehensive	reform	program	,	which	we	developed	ourselves	.
Not	the	International	Monetary	Fund	.	Not	the	World	Bank	,	where	I	worked	for	21	years	and	rose	to	be	a	vice	president	.
No	one	can	do	it	for	you	.	You	have	to	do	it	for	yourself	.
We	put	together	a	program	that	would	,	one	:	get	the	state	out	of	businesses	it	had	nothing	--	it	had	no	business	being	in	.
The	state	should	not	be	in	the	business	of	producing	goods	and	services	because	it	's	inefficient	and	incompetent	.
So	we	decided	to	privatize	many	of	our	enterprises	.
We	--	as	a	result	,	we	decided	to	liberalize	many	of	our	markets	.
Can	you	believe	that	prior	to	this	reform	--	which	started	at	the	end	of	2003	,	when	I	left	Washington	to	go	and	take	up	the	post	of	Finance	Minister	--	we	had	a	telecommunications	company	that	was	only	able	to	develop	4,500	landlines	in	its	entire	30-year	history	?
Having	a	telephone	in	my	country	was	a	huge	luxury	.
You	could	n't	get	it	.	You	had	to	bribe	.
You	had	to	do	everything	to	get	your	phone	.
When	President	Obasanjo	supported	and	launched	the	liberalization	of	the	telecommunications	sector	,	we	went	from	4,500	landlines	to	32	million	GSM	lines	,	and	counting	.
Nigeria	's	telecoms	market	is	the	second-fastest	growing	in	the	world	,	after	China	.	We	are	getting	investments	of	about	a	billion	dollars	a	year	in	telecoms	.	And	nobody	knows	,	except	a	few	smart	people	.
The	smartest	one	,	first	to	come	in	,	was	the	MTN	company	of	South	Africa	.
And	in	the	three	years	that	I	was	Finance	Minister	,	they	made	an	average	of	360	million	dollars	profit	per	year	.
360	million	in	a	market	--	in	a	country	that	is	a	poor	country	,	with	an	average	per	capita	income	just	under	500	dollars	per	capita	.
So	the	market	is	there	.
When	they	kept	this	under	wraps	,	but	soon	others	got	to	know	.
Nigerians	themselves	began	to	develop	some	wireless	telecommunications	companies	,	and	three	or	four	others	have	come	in	.
But	there	's	a	huge	market	out	there	,	and	people	do	n't	know	about	it	,	or	they	do	n't	want	to	know	.
So	privatization	is	one	of	the	things	we	've	done	.
The	other	thing	we	've	also	done	is	to	manage	our	finances	better	.
Because	nobody	's	going	to	help	you	and	support	you	if	you	're	not	managing	your	own	finances	well	.
And	Nigeria	,	with	the	oil	sector	,	had	the	reputation	of	being	corrupt	and	not	managing	its	own	public	finances	well	.
So	what	did	we	try	to	do	?	We	introduced	a	fiscal	rule	that	de-linked	our	budget	from	the	oil	price	.
Before	we	used	to	just	budget	on	whatever	oil	we	bring	in	,	because	oil	is	the	biggest	,	most	revenue-earning	sector	in	the	economy	:	70	percent	of	our	revenues	come	from	oil	.
We	de-linked	that	,	and	once	we	did	it	,	we	began	to	budget	at	a	price	slightly	lower	than	the	oil	price	and	save	whatever	was	above	that	price	.
We	did	n't	know	we	could	pull	it	off	;	it	was	very	controversial	.
But	what	it	immediately	did	was	that	the	volatility	that	had	been	present	in	terms	of	our	economic	development	--	where	,	even	if	oil	prices	were	high	,	we	would	grow	very	fast	.
When	they	crashed	,	we	crashed	.
And	we	could	hardly	even	pay	anything	,	any	salaries	,	in	the	economy	.
That	smoothened	out	.	We	were	able	to	save	,	just	before	I	left	,	27	billion	dollars	.	Whereas	--	and	this	went	to	our	reserves	--	when	I	arrived	in	2003	,	we	had	seven	billion	dollars	in	reserves	.
By	the	time	I	left	,	we	had	gone	up	to	almost	30	billion	dollars	.	And	as	we	speak	now	,	we	have	about	40	billion	dollars	in	reserves	due	to	proper	management	of	our	finances	.
And	that	shores	up	our	economy	,	makes	it	stable	.
Our	exchange	rate	that	used	to	fluctuate	all	the	time	is	now	fairly	stable	and	being	managed	so	that	business	people	have	a	predictability	of	prices	in	the	economy	.
We	brought	inflation	down	from	28	percent	to	about	11	percent	.
And	we	had	GDP	grow	from	an	average	of	2.3	percent	the	previous	decade	to	about	6.5	percent	now	.
So	all	the	changes	and	reforms	we	were	able	to	make	have	shown	up	in	results	that	are	measurable	in	the	economy	.
And	what	is	more	important	,	because	we	want	to	get	away	from	oil	and	diversify	--	and	there	are	so	many	opportunities	in	this	one	big	country	,	as	in	many	countries	in	Africa	--	what	was	remarkable	is	that	much	of	this	growth	came	not	from	the	oil	sector	alone	,	but	from	non-oil	.
Agriculture	grew	at	better	than	eight	percent	.
As	telecoms	sector	grew	,	housing	and	construction	,	and	I	could	go	on	and	on	.	And	this	is	to	illustrate	to	you	that	once	you	get	the	macro-economy	straightened	out	,	the	opportunities	in	various	other	sectors	are	enormous	.
We	have	opportunities	in	agriculture	,	like	I	said	.
We	have	opportunities	in	solid	minerals	.	We	have	a	lot	of	minerals	that	no	one	has	even	invested	in	or	explored	.	And	we	realized	that	without	the	proper	legislation	to	make	that	possible	,	that	would	n't	happen	.	So	we	've	now	got	a	mining	code	that	is	comparable	with	some	of	the	best	in	the	world	.
We	have	opportunities	in	housing	and	real	estate	.
There	was	nothing	in	a	country	of	140	million	people	--	no	shopping	malls	as	you	know	them	here	.
This	was	an	investment	opportunity	for	someone	that	excited	the	imagination	of	people	.
And	now	,	we	have	a	situation	in	which	the	businesses	in	this	mall	are	doing	four	times	the	turnover	that	they	had	projected	.
So	,	huge	things	in	construction	,	real	estate	,	mortgage	markets	.	Financial	services	:	we	had	89	banks	.	Too	many	not	doing	their	real	business	.
We	consolidated	them	from	89	to	25	banks	by	requiring	that	they	increase	their	capital	--	share	capital	.
And	it	went	from	about	25	million	dollars	to	150	million	dollars	.
The	banks	--	these	banks	are	now	consolidated	,	and	that	strengthening	of	the	banking	system	has	attracted	a	lot	of	investment	from	outside	.
Barclays	Bank	of	the	U.K.	is	bringing	in	500	million	.
Standard	Chartered	has	brought	in	140	million	.
And	I	can	go	on	.	Dollars	,	on	and	on	,	into	the	system	.
We	are	doing	the	same	with	the	insurance	sector	.
So	in	financial	services	,	a	great	deal	of	opportunity	.
In	tourism	,	in	many	African	countries	,	a	great	opportunity	.
And	that	's	what	many	people	know	East	Africa	for	:	the	wildlife	,	the	elephants	,	and	so	on	.
But	managing	the	tourism	market	in	a	way	that	can	really	benefit	the	people	is	very	important	.
So	what	am	I	trying	to	say	?	I	'm	trying	to	tell	you	that	there	's	a	new	wave	on	the	continent	.
A	new	wave	of	openness	and	democratization	in	which	,	since	2000	,	more	than	two-thirds	of	African	countries	have	had	multi-party	democratic	elections	.
Not	all	of	them	have	been	perfect	,	or	will	be	,	but	the	trend	is	very	clear	.
I	'm	trying	to	tell	you	that	since	the	past	three	years	,	the	average	rate	of	growth	on	the	continent	has	moved	from	about	2.5	percent	to	about	five	percent	per	annum	.
This	is	better	than	the	performance	of	many	OECD	countries	.
So	it	's	clear	that	things	are	changing	.
Conflicts	are	down	on	the	continent	;	from	about	12	conflicts	a	decade	ago	,	we	are	down	to	three	or	four	conflicts	--	one	of	the	most	terrible	,	of	course	,	of	which	is	Darfur	.
And	,	you	know	,	you	have	the	neighborhood	effect	where	if	something	is	going	on	in	one	part	of	the	continent	,	it	looks	like	the	entire	continent	is	affected	.
But	you	should	know	that	this	continent	is	not	--	is	a	continent	of	many	countries	,	not	one	country	.
And	if	we	are	down	to	three	or	four	conflicts	,	it	means	that	there	are	plenty	of	opportunities	to	invest	in	stable	,	growing	,	exciting	economies	where	there	's	plenty	of	opportunity	.
And	I	want	to	just	make	one	point	about	this	investment	.
The	best	way	to	help	Africans	today	is	to	help	them	to	stand	on	their	own	feet	.
And	the	best	way	to	do	that	is	by	helping	create	jobs	.
There	's	no	issue	with	fighting	malaria	and	putting	money	in	that	and	saving	children	's	lives	.	That	's	not	what	I	'm	saying	.	That	is	fine	.
But	imagine	the	impact	on	a	family	:	if	the	parents	can	be	employed	and	make	sure	that	their	children	go	to	school	,	that	they	can	buy	the	drugs	to	fight	the	disease	themselves	.
If	we	can	invest	in	places	where	you	yourselves	make	money	whilst	creating	jobs	and	helping	people	stand	on	their	own	feet	,	is	n't	that	a	wonderful	opportunity	?	Is	n't	that	the	way	to	go	?
And	I	want	to	say	that	some	of	the	best	people	to	invest	in	on	the	continent	are	the	women	.
I	have	a	CD	here	.	I	'm	sorry	that	I	did	n't	say	anything	on	time	.
Otherwise	,	I	would	have	liked	you	to	have	seen	this	.
It	says	,	``	Africa	:	Open	for	Business	.	''	And	this	is	a	video	that	has	actually	won	an	award	as	the	best	documentary	of	the	year	.
Understand	that	the	woman	who	made	it	is	going	to	be	in	Tanzania	,	where	they	're	having	the	session	in	June	.
But	it	shows	you	Africans	,	and	particularly	African	women	,	who	against	all	odds	have	developed	businesses	,	some	of	them	world-class	.
One	of	the	women	in	this	video	,	Adenike	Ogunlesi	,	making	children	's	clothes	--	which	she	started	as	a	hobby	and	grew	into	a	business	.
Mixing	African	materials	,	such	as	we	have	,	with	materials	from	elsewhere	.
So	,	she	'll	make	a	little	pair	of	dungarees	with	corduroys	,	with	African	material	mixed	in	.	Very	creative	designs	,
has	reached	a	stage	where	she	even	had	an	order	from	Wal-Mart	.
For	10,000	pieces	.
So	that	shows	you	that	we	have	people	who	are	capable	of	doing	.
And	the	women	are	diligent	.	They	are	focused	;	they	work	hard	.
I	could	go	on	giving	examples	:	Beatrice	Gakuba	of	Rwanda	,	who	opened	up	a	flower	business	and	is	now	exporting	to	the	Dutch	auction	in	Amsterdam	each	morning	and	is	employing	200	other	women	and	men	to	work	with	her	.
However	,	many	of	these	are	starved	for	capital	to	expand	,	because	nobody	believes	outside	of	our	countries	that	we	can	do	what	is	necessary	.	Nobody	thinks	in	terms	of	a	market	.
Nobody	thinks	there	's	opportunity	.
But	I	'm	standing	here	saying	that	those	who	miss	the	boat	now	,	will	miss	it	forever	.
So	if	you	want	to	be	in	Africa	,	think	about	investing	.
Think	about	the	Beatrices	,	think	about	the	Adenikes	of	this	world	,	who	are	doing	incredible	things	,	that	are	bringing	them	into	the	global	economy	,	whilst	at	the	same	time	making	sure	that	their	fellow	men	and	women	are	employed	,	and	that	the	children	in	those	households	get	educated	because	their	parents	are	earning	adequate	income	.
So	I	invite	you	to	explore	the	opportunities	.
When	you	go	to	Tanzania	,	listen	carefully	,	because	I	'm	sure	you	will	hear	of	the	various	openings	that	there	will	be	for	you	to	get	involved	in	something	that	will	do	good	for	the	continent	,	for	the	people	and	for	yourselves	.
Thank	you	very	much	.
One	of	the	problems	of	writing	,	and	working	,	and	looking	at	the	Internet	is	that	it	's	very	hard	to	separate	fashion	from	deep	change	.
And	so	,	to	start	helping	that	,	I	want	to	take	us	back	to	1835	.
In	1835	,	James	Gordon	Bennett	founded	the	first	mass-circulation	newspaper	in	New	York	City	.
And	it	cost	about	500	dollars	to	start	it	,	which	was	about	the	equivalent	of	10,000	dollars	of	today	.
By	15	years	later	,	by	1850	,	doing	the	same	thing	--	starting	what	was	experienced	as	a	mass	--	circulation	daily	paper	--	would	come	to	cost	two	and	a	half	million	dollars	.
10,000	,	two	and	a	half	million	,	15	years	.
That	's	the	critical	change	that	is	being	inverted	by	the	Net	.
And	that	's	what	I	want	to	talk	about	today	,	and	how	that	relates	to	the	emergence	of	social	production	.
Starting	with	newspapers	,	what	we	saw	was	high	cost	as	an	initial	requirement	for	making	information	,	knowledge	and	culture	,	which	led	to	a	stark	bifurcation	between	producers	--	who	had	to	be	able	to	raise	financial	capital	,	just	like	any	other	industrial	organization	--	and	passive	consumers	that	could	choose	from	a	certain	set	of	things	that	this	industrial	model	could	produce	.
Now	,	the	term	``	information	society	,	''	``	information	economy	,	''	for	a	very	long	time	has	been	used	as	the	thing	that	comes	after
the	industrial	revolution	.	But	in	fact	,	for	purposes	of	understanding	what	's	happening
today	,	that	's	wrong	.	Because	for	150	years	,	we	've	had	an	information	economy	.
It	's	just	been	industrial	,
which	means	those	who	were	producing	had	to	have	a	way	of	raising	money	to	pay	those	two	and	a	half	million	dollars	,	and	later	,	more	for	the	telegraph	,	and	the	radio	transmitter	,	and	the	television	,	and	eventually	the	mainframe	.
And	that	meant	they	were	market	based	,	or	they	were	government	owned	,	depending	on	what	kind	of	system	they	were	in	.	And	this	characterized	and	anchored	the	way	information	and	knowledge	were	produced	for	the	next	150	years	.
Now	,	let	me	tell	you	a	different	story	.	Around	June	2002	,	the	world	of	supercomputers	had	a	bombshell	.
The	Japanese	had	,	for	the	first	time	,	created	the	fastest	supercomputer	--	the	NEC	Earth	Simulator	--	taking	the	primary	from	the	U.S.	,	and	about	two	years	later	--	this	,	by	the	way	,	is	measuring	the	trillion	floating-point	operations	per	second	that	the	computer	's	capable	of	running	--
sigh	of	relief	:	IBM	[	Blue	Gene	]	has	just	edged	ahead	of	the	NEC	Earth	Simulator	.
All	of	this	completely	ignores	the	fact	that	throughout	this	period	,	there	's	another	supercomputer	running	in	the	world	--	SETI	@	home	.	Four	and	a	half	million	users	around	the	world	,	contributing	their	leftover	computer	cycles	,	whenever	their	computer	is	n't	working	,	by	running	a	screen	saver	,	and	together	sharing	their	resources	to	create	a	massive	supercomputer	that	NASA	harnesses	to	analyze	the	data	coming	from	radio	telescopes	.
What	this	picture	suggests	to	us	is	that	we	've	got	a	radical	change	in	the	way	information	production	and	exchange	is	capitalized	.	Not	that	it	's	become	less	capital	intensive	--	that	there	's	less	money	that	's	required	--	but	that	the	ownership	of	this	capital	,	the	way	the	capitalization	happens	,	is	radically	distributed	.	Each	of	us	,	in	these	advanced	economies	,	has	one	of	these	,	or	something	rather	like	it	--	a	computer	.
They	're	not	radically	different	from	routers	inside	the	middle	of	the	network	.
And	computation	,	storage	and	communications	capacity	are	in	the	hands	of	practically	every	connected	person	--	and	these	are	the	basic	physical	capital	means	necessary	for	producing	information	,	knowledge	and	culture	,	in	the	hands	of	something	like	600	million	to	a	billion	people	around	the	planet	.
What	this	means	is	that	for	the	first	time	since	the	industrial	revolution	,	the	most	important	means	,	the	most	important	components	of	the	core	economic	activities	--	remember	,	we	are	in	an	information	economy	--	of	the	most	advanced	economies	,	and	there	more	than	anywhere	else	,	are	in	the	hands	of	the	population	at	large	.	This	is	completely	different	than	what	we	've	seen	since	the	industrial	revolution	.	So	we	've	got	communications	and	computation	capacity	in	the	hands	of	the	entire	population	,	and	we	've	got	human	creativity	,	human	wisdom	,	human	experience	--	the	other	major	experience	,	the	other	major	input	--
which	unlike	simple	labor	--	stand	here	turning	this	lever	all	day	long	--	is	not	something	that	's	the	same	or	fungible	among	people	.
Any	one	of	you	who	has	taken	someone	else	's	job	,	or	tried	to	give	yours	to	someone	else	,	no	matter	how	detailed	the	manual	,	you	can	not	transmit	what	you	know	,	what	you	will	intuit	under	a	certain	set	of	circumstances	.
In	that	we	're	unique	,	and	each	of	us	holds	this	critical	input	into	production	as	we	hold	this	machine	.
What	's	the	effect	of	this	?	So	,	the	story	that	most	people	know	is	the	story	of	free	or	open	source	software	.
This	is	market	share	of	Apache	Web	server	--	one	of	the	critical	applications	in	Web-based	communications	.
In	1995	,	two	groups	of	people	said	,	``	Wow	,	this	is	really	important	,	the	Web	!	We	need	a	much	better	Web	server	!	''
One	was	a	motley	collection	of	volunteers	who	just	decided	,	you	know	,	we	really	need	this	,	we	should	write	one	,	and	what	are	we	going	to	do	with	what	--	well	,	we	're	gon	na	share	it	!	And	other	people	will	be	able	to	develop	it	.
The	other	was	Microsoft	.
Now	,	if	I	told	you	that	10	years	later	,	the	motley	crew	of	people	,	who	did	n't	control	anything	that	they	produced	,	acquired	20	percent	of	the	market	and	was	the	red	line	,	it	would	be	amazing	!	Right	?
Think	of	it	in	minivans	.	A	group	of	automobile	engineers	on	their	weekends	are	competing	with	Toyota	.	Right	?
But	,	in	fact	,	of	course	,	the	story	is	it	's	the	70	percent	,	including	the	major	e-commerce	site	--	70	percent	of	a	critical	application	on	which	Web-based	communications	and	applications	work	is	produced	in	this	form	,	in	direct	competition	with	Microsoft	.	Not	in	a	side	issue	--	in	a	central	strategic	decision	to	try	to	capture	a	component	of	the	Net	.
Software	has	done	this	in	a	way	that	's	been	very	visible	,	because	it	's	measurable	.	But	the	thing	to	see	is	that	this	actually	happens	throughout	the	Web	.
So	,	NASA	,	at	some	point	,	did	an	experiment	where	they	took	images	of	Mars	that	they	were	mapping	,	and	they	said	,	instead	of	having	three	or	four	fully	trained	Ph.D.s	doing	this	all	the	time	,	let	's	break	it	up	into	small	components	,	put	it	up	on	the	Web	,	and	see	if	people	,	using	a	very	simple	interface	,	will	actually	spend	five	minutes	here	,	10	minutes	there	,	clicking	.	After	six	months	,	85,000	people	used	this	to	generate	mapping	at	a	faster	rate	than	the	images	were	coming	in	,	which	was	,	quote	,	``	practically	indistinguishable	from	the	markings	of	a	fully-trained	Ph.D.	,	''	once	you	showed	it	to	a	number	of	people	and	computed	the	average	.
Now	,	if	you	have	a	little	girl	,	and	she	goes	and	writes	to	--	well	,	not	so	little	,	medium	little	--	tries	to	do	research	on	Barbie	.
And	she	'll	come	to	Encarta	,	one	of	the	main	online	encyclopedias	.	This	is	what	you	'll	find	out	about	Barbie	.	This	is	it	,	there	's	nothing	more	to	the	definition	,	including	,	``	manufacturers	''	--	plural	--	``	now	more	commonly	produce	ethnically	diverse	dolls	,	like	this	black	Barbie	.	''	Which	is	vastly	better	than	what	you	'll	find	in	the	encyclopedia.com	,	which	is	Barbie	,	Klaus	.
On	the	other	hand	,	if	they	go	to	Wikipedia	,	they	'll	find	a	genuine	article	--	and	I	wo	n't	talk	a	lot	about	Wikipedia	,	because	Jimmy	Wales	is	here	--	but	roughly	equivalent	to	what	you	would	find	in	the	Britannica	,	differently	written	,	including	the	controversies	over	body	image	and	commercialization	,	the	claims	about	the	way	in	which	she	's	a	good	role	model	,	etc	.
Another	portion	is	not	only	how	content	is	produced	,	but	how	relevance	is	produced	.
The	claim	to	fame	of	Yahoo	!	was	,	we	hire	people	to	look	--	originally	,	not	anymore	--	we	hire	people	to	look	at	websites	and	tell	you	--	if	they	're	in	the	index	,	they	're	good	.	This	,	on	the	other	hand	,	is	what	60,000	passionate	volunteers	produce	in	the	Open	Directory	Project	,
each	one	willing	to	spend	an	hour	or	two	on	something	they	really	care	about	,	to	say	,	this	is	good	.	So	,	this	is	the	Open	Directory	Project	,	with	60,000	volunteers	,	each	one	spending	a	little	bit	of	time	,	as	opposed	to	a	few	hundred	fully	paid	employees	.	No	one	owns	it	,	no	one	owns	the	output	,	it	's	free	for	anyone	to	use	and	it	's	the	output	of	people	acting	out	of	social	and	psychological	motivations	to	do	something	interesting	.
This	is	not	only	outside	of	businesses	.	When	you	think	of	what	is	the	critical	innovation	of	Google	,	the	critical	innovation	is	outsourcing	the	one	most	important	thing	--	the	decision	about	what	's	relevant	--	to	the	community	of	the	Web	as	a	whole	,	doing	whatever	they	want	to	do	:	so	,	page	rank	.
The	critical	innovation	here	is	instead	of	our	engineers	,	or	our	people	saying	which	is	the	most	relevant	,	we	're	going	to	go	out	and	count	what	you	,	people	out	there	on	the	Web	,	for	whatever	reason	--	vanity	,	pleasure	--	produced	links	,	and	tied	to	each	other	.	We	're	going	to	count	those	,	and	count	them	up	.
And	again	,	here	,	you	see	Barbie.com	,	but	also	,	very	quickly	,	Adiosbarbie.com	,	the	body	image	for	every	size	.	A	contested	cultural	object	,	which	you	wo	n't	find	anywhere	soon	on	Overture	,	which	is	the	classic	market-based	mechanism	:	whoever	pays	the	most	is	highest	on	the	list	.
So	,	all	of	that	is	in	the	creation	of	content	,	of	relevance	,	basic	human	expression	.
But	remember	,	the	computers	were	also	physical	.	Just	physical	materials	--	our	PCs	--	we	share	them	together	.	We	also	see	this	in	wireless	.
It	used	to	be	wireless	was	one	person	owned	the	license	,	they	transmitted	in	an	area	,	and	it	had	to	be	decided	whether	they	would	be	licensed	or	based	on	property	.
What	we	're	seeing	now	is	that	computers	and	radios	are	becoming	so	sophisticated	that	we	're	developing	algorithms	to	let	people	own	machines	,	like	Wi-Fi	devices	,	and	overlay	them	with	a	sharing	protocol	that	would	allow	a	community	like	this	to	build	its	own	wireless	broadband	network	simply	from	the	simple	principle	:	When	I	'm	listening	,	when	I	'm	not	using	,	I	can	help	you	transfer	your	messages	;
and	when	you	're	not	using	,	you	'll	help	me	transfer	yours	.
And	this	is	not	an	idealized	version	.	These	are	working	models	that	at	least	in	some	places	in	the	United	States	are	being	implemented	,	at	least	for	public	security	.
If	in	1999	I	told	you	,	let	's	build	a	data	storage	and	retrieval	system	.
It	's	got	to	store	terabytes	.	It	's	got	to	be	available	24	hours	a	day	,	seven	days	a	week	.	It	's	got	to	be	available	from	anywhere	in	the	world	.
It	has	to	support	over	100	million	users	at	any	given	moment	.	It	's	got	to	be	robust	to	attack	,	including	closing	the	main	index	,	injecting	malicious	files	,	armed	seizure	of	some	major	nodes	.	You	'd	say	that	would	take	years	.
It	would	take	millions	.	But	of	course	,	what	I	'm	describing	is	P2P	file	sharing	.
Right	?	We	always	think	of	it	as	stealing	music	,	but	fundamentally	,	it	's	a	distributed	data	storage	and	retrieval	system	,	where	people	,	for	very	obvious	reasons	,	are	willing	to	share	their	bandwidth	and	their	storage	to	create	something	.
So	,	essentially	what	we	're	seeing	is	the	emergence	of	a	fourth	transactional	framework	.	It	used	to	be	that	there	were	two	primary	dimensions	along	which
you	could	divide	things	.	They	could	be	market	based	,	or	non-market	based	;	they	could	be	decentralized	,	or	centralized	.
The	price	system	was	a	market-based	and	decentralized	system	.
If	things	worked	better	because	you	actually	had	somebody	organizing	them	,	you	had	firms	,	if	you	wanted	to	be	in	the	market	--	or	you	had	governments	or	sometimes	larger	non-profits	in	the	non-market	.
It	was	too	expensive	to	have	decentralized	social	production	,	to	have	decentralized	action	in	society	.	That	was	not	about	society	itself	.
That	was	,	in	fact	,	economic	.
But	what	we	're	seeing	now	is	the	emergence	of	this	fourth	system	of	social	sharing	and	exchange	.
Not	that	it	's	the	first	time	that	we	do	nice	things	to	each	other	,	or	for	each	other	,	as	social	beings	.	We	do	it	all	the	time	.
It	's	that	it	's	the	first	time	that	it	's	having	major	economic	impact	.
What	characterizes	them	is	decentralized	authority	.
You	do	n't	have	to	ask	permission	,	as	you	do	in	a	property-based	system	.
May	I	do	this	?	It	's	open	for	anyone	to	create	and	innovate	and	share	,	if	they	want	to	,	by	themselves	or	with	others	,	because	property	is	one	mechanism	of	coordination	.	But	it	's	not	the	only	one	.
Instead	,	what	we	see	are	social	frameworks	for	all	of	the	critical	things	that	we	use	property	and	contract	in	the	market	:	information	flows	to	decide	what	are	interesting	problems	;	who	's	available	and	good	for	something	;	motivation	structures	--	remember	,	money	is	n't	always	the	best	motivator	.
If	you	leave	a	$	50	check	after	dinner	with	friends	,	you	do	n't	increase	the	probability	of	being	invited	back	.
And	if	dinner	is	n't	entirely	obvious	,	think	of	sex	.
It	also	requires	certain	new	organizational	approaches	.
And	in	particular	,	what	we	've	seen	is	task	organization	.
You	have	to	hire	people	who	know	what	they	're	doing	.
You	have	to	hire	them	to	spend	a	lot	of	time	.
Now	,	take	the	same	problem	,	chunk	it	into	little	modules	,	and	motivations	become	trivial	.
Five	minutes	,	instead	of	watching	TV	?
Five	minutes	I	'll	spend	just	because	it	's	interesting	.	Just	because	it	's	fun	.
Just	because	it	gives	me	a	certain	sense	of	meaning	,	or	,	in	places	that	are	more	involved	,	like	Wikipedia	,	gives	me	a	certain	set	of	social	relations	.
So	,	a	new	social	phenomenon	is	emerging	.
It	's	creating	,	and	it	's	most	visible	when	we	see	it	as	a	new	form	of	competition	.
Peer-to-peer	networks	assaulting	the	recording	industry	;	free	and	open	source	software	taking	market	share	from	Microsoft	;	Skype	potentially	threatening	traditional	telecoms	;	Wikipedia	competing	with	online	encyclopedias	.
But	it	's	also	a	new	source	of	opportunities	for	businesses	.
As	you	see	a	new	set	of	social	relations	and	behaviors	emerging	,	you	have	new	opportunities	.	Some	of	them	are	toolmakers	.
Instead	of	building	well-behaved	appliances	--	things	that	you	know	what	they	'll	do	in	advance	--	you	begin	to	build	more	open	tools	.	There	's	a	new	set	of	values	,	a	new	set	of	things	people	value	.
You	build	platforms	for	self-expression	and	collaboration	.
Like	Wikipedia	,	like	the	Open	Directory	Project	,	you	're	beginning	to	build	platforms	,	and	you	see	that	as	a	model	.
And	you	see	surfers	,	people	who	see	this	happening	,	and	in	some	sense	build	it	into	a	supply	chain	,	which	is	a	very	curious	one	.	Right	?
You	have	a	belief	:	stuff	will	flow	out	of	connected	human	beings	.
That	'll	give	me	something	I	can	use	,	and	I	'm	going	to	contract	with	someone	.
I	will	deliver	something	based	on	what	happens	.	It	's	very	scary	--	that	's	what	Google	does	,	essentially	.
That	's	what	IBM	does	in	software	services	,	and	they	've	done	reasonably	well	.
So	,	social	production	is	a	real	fact	,	not	a	fad	.
It	is	the	critical	long-term	shift	caused	by	the	Internet	.
Social	relations	and	exchange	become	significantly	more	important	than	they	ever	were	as	an	economic	phenomenon	.	In	some	contexts	,	it	's	even	more	efficient	because	of	the	quality	of	the	information	,	the	ability	to	find	the	best	person	,	the	lower	transaction	costs	.	It	's	sustainable	and	growing	fast	.
But	--	and	this	is	the	dark	lining	--	it	is	threatened	by	--	in	the	same	way	that	it	threatens	--	the	incumbent	industrial	systems	.
So	next	time	you	open	the	paper	,	and	you	see	an	intellectual	property	decision	,	a	telecoms	decision	,	it	's	not	about	something	small	and	technical	.
It	is	about	the	future	of	the	freedom	to	be	as	social	beings	with	each	other	,	and	the	way	information	,	knowledge	and	culture	will	be	produced	.
Because	it	is	in	this	context	that	we	see	a	battle	over	how	easy	or	hard	it	will	be	for	the	industrial	information	economy	to	simply	go	on	as	it	goes	,	or	for	the	new	model	of	production	to	begin	to	develop	alongside	that	industrial	model	,	and	change	the	way	we	begin	to	see	the	world	and	report	what	it	is	that	we	see	.
Thank	you	.
Do	you	worry	about	what	is	going	to	kill	you	?
Heart	disease	,	cancer	,	a	car	accident	?
Most	of	us	worry	about	things	we	ca	n't	control	,	like	war	,	terrorism	,	the	tragic	earthquake	that	just	occurred	in	Haiti	.
But	what	really	threatens	humanity	?
A	few	years	ago	,	Professor	Vaclav	Smil	tried	to	calculate	the	probability	of	sudden	disasters	large	enough	to	change	history	.
He	called	these	,	``	massively	fatal	discontinuities	,	''	meaning	that	they	could	kill	up	to	100	million	people	in	the	next	50	years	.
He	looked	at	the	odds	of	another	world	war	,	of	a	massive	volcanic	eruption	,	even	of	an	asteroid	hitting	the	Earth	.
But	he	placed	the	likelihood	of	one	such	event	above	all	others	at	close	to	100	percent	,	and	that	is	a	severe	flu	pandemic	.
Now	,	you	might	think	of	flu	as	just	a	really	bad	cold	,
but	it	can	be	a	death	sentence	.
Every	year	,	36,000	people	in	the	United	States	die	of	seasonal	flu	.
In	the	developing	world	,	the	data	is	much	sketchier	but	the	death	toll	is	almost	certainly	higher	.
You	know	,	the	problem	is	if	this	virus	occasionally	mutates	so	dramatically	,	it	essentially	is	a	new	virus
and	then	we	get	a	pandemic	.
In	1918	,	a	new	virus	appeared	that	killed	some	50	to	100	million	people	.
It	spread	like	wildfire
and	some	died	within	hours	of	developing	symptoms	.
Are	we	safer	today	?
Well	,	we	seem	to	have	dodged	the	deadly	pandemic	this	year	that	most	of	us	feared	,	but	this	threat	could	reappear	at	any	time	.
The	good	news	is	that	we	're	at	a	moment	in	time	when	science	,	technology	,	globalization	is	converging	to	create	an	unprecedented	possibility	:	the	possibility	to	make	history	by	preventing	infectious	diseases	that	still	account	for	one-fifth	of	all	deaths	and	countless	misery	on	Earth	.	We	can	do	this	.
We	're	already	preventing	millions	of	deaths	with	existing	vaccines	,
and	if	we	get	these	to	more	people	,	we	can	certainly	save	more	lives	.
But	with	new	or	better	vaccines	for	malaria	,	TB	,	HIV	,	pneumonia	,	diarrhea	,	flu	,	we	could	end	suffering	that	has	been	on	the	Earth	since	the	beginning	of	time	.
So	,	I	'm	here	to	trumpet	vaccines	for	you	.	But	first	,	I	have	to	explain	why	they	're	important
because	vaccines	,	the	power	of	them	,	is	really	like	a	whisper	.
When	they	work	,	they	can	make	history	,	but	after	a	while	you	can	barely	hear	them	.
Now	,	some	of	us	are	old	enough	to	have	a	small	,	circular	scar	on	our	arms	from	an	inoculation	we	received	as	children	.
But	when	was	the	last	time	you	worried	about	smallpox	,	a	disease	that	killed	half	a	billion	people	last	century	and	no	longer	is	with	us	?
Or	polio	?	How	many	of	you	remember	the	iron	lung	?
We	do	n't	see	scenes	like	this	anymore	because	of	vaccines	.
Now	,	it	's	interesting	because	there	are	30-odd	diseases	that	can	be	treated	with	vaccines	now	,	but	we	're	still	threatened	by	things	like	HIV	and	flu	.
Why	is	that	?
Well	,	here	's	the	dirty	little	secret	.	Until	recently	,	we	have	n't	had	to	know	exactly	how	a	vaccine	worked	.
We	knew	they	worked	through	old-fashioned	trial	and	error	.
You	took	a	pathogen	,	you	modified	it	,	you	injected	it	into	a	person	or	an	animal	and	you	saw	what	happened	.
This	worked	well	for	most	pathogens	,	somewhat	well	for	crafty	bugs	like	flu	,	but	not	at	all	for	HIV	,	for	which	humans	have	no	natural	immunity	.
So	let	's	explore	how	vaccines	work	.
They	basically	create	a	cache	of	weapons	for	your	immune	system	which	you	can	deploy	when	needed	.
Now	,	when	you	get	a	viral	infection	,	what	normally	happens	is	it	takes	days	or	weeks	for	your	body	to	fight	back	at	full	strength	,	and	that	might	be	too	late	.
When	you	're	pre-immunized	,	what	happens	is	you	have	forces	in	your	body	pre-trained	to	recognize	and	defeat	specific	foes	.
So	that	's	really	how	vaccines	work	.
Now	,	let	's	take	a	look	at	a	video	that	we	're	debuting	at	TED	,	for	the	first	time	,	on	how	an	effective	HIV	vaccine	might	work	.
Narrator	:	A	vaccine	trains	the	body	in	advance	how	to	recognize	and	neutralize	a	specific	invader	.
After	HIV	penetrates	the	body	's	mucosal	barriers	,	it	infects	immune	cells	to	replicate	.
The	invader	draws	the	attention	of	the	immune	system	's	front-line	troops	.
Dendritic	cells	,	or	macrophages	,	capture	the	virus	and	display	pieces	of	it	.
Memory	cells	generated	by	the	HIV	vaccine	are	activated	when	they	learn	HIV	is	present	from	the	front-line	troops	.
These	memory	cells	immediately	deploy	the	exact	weapons	needed	.
Memory	B	cells	turn	into	plasma	cells	,	which	produce	wave	after	wave	of	the	specific	antibodies	that	latch	onto	HIV	to	prevent	it	from	infecting	cells	,	while	squadrons	of	killer	T	cells	seek	out	and	destroy	cells	that	are	already	HIV	infected	.
The	virus	is	defeated	.
Without	a	vaccine	,	these	responses	would	have	taken	more	than	a	week	.
By	that	time	,	the	battle	against	HIV	would	already	have	been	lost	.
Seth	Berkley	:	Really	cool	video	,	is	n't	it	?
The	antibodies	you	just	saw	in	this	video	,	in	action	,	are	the	ones	that	make	most	vaccines	work	.
So	the	real	question	then	is	:	How	do	we	ensure	that	your	body	makes	the	exact	ones	that	we	need	to	protect	against	flu	and	HIV	?
The	principal	challenge	for	both	of	these	viruses	is	that	they	're	always	changing	.
So	let	's	take	a	look	at	the	flu	virus	.
In	this	rendering	of	the	flu	virus	,	these	different	colored	spikes	are	what	it	uses	to	infect	you	.
And	also	,	what	the	antibodies	use	is	a	handle	to	essentially	grab	and	neutralize	the	virus	.
When	these	mutate	,	they	change	their	shape	,	and	the	antibodies	do	n't	know	what	they	're	looking	at	anymore	.
So	that	's	why	every	year	you	can	catch	a	slightly	different	strain	of	flu	.
It	's	also	why	in	the	spring	,	we	have	to	make	a	best	guess	at	which	three	strains	are	going	to	prevail	the	next	year	,	put	those	into	a	single	vaccine	and	rush	those	into	production	for	the	fall	.
Even	worse	,	the	most	common	influenza	--	influenza	A	--	also	infects	animals	that	live	in	close	proximity	to	humans	,	and	they	can	recombine	in	those	particular	animals	.
In	addition	,	wild	aquatic	birds	carry	all	known	strains	of	influenza	.
So	,	you	've	got	this	situation	:
In	2003	,	we	had	an	H5N1	virus	that	jumped	from	birds	into	humans	in	a	few	isolated	cases	with	an	apparent	mortality	rate	of	70	percent	.
Now	luckily	,	that	particular	virus	,	although	very	scary	at	the	time	,	did	not	transmit	from	person	to	person	very	easily	.
This	year	's	H1N1	threat	was	actually	a	human	,	avian	,	swine	mixture	that	arose	in	Mexico	.
It	was	easily	transmitted	,	but	,	luckily	,	was	pretty	mild	.
And	so	,	in	a	sense	,	our	luck	is	holding	out	,	but	you	know	,	another	wild	bird	could	fly	over	at	anytime	.
Now	let	's	take	a	look	at	HIV	.
As	variable	as	flu	is	,	HIV	makes	flu	look	like	the	Rock	of	Gibraltar	.
The	virus	that	causes	AIDS	is	the	trickiest	pathogen	scientists	have	ever	confronted	.
It	mutates	furiously	,
it	has	decoys	to	evade	the	immune	system	,
it	attacks	the	very	cells	that	are	trying	to	fight	it
and	it	quickly	hides	itself	in	your	genome	.
Here	's	a	slide	looking	at	the	genetic	variation	of	flu	and	comparing	that	to	HIV	,	a	much	wilder	target	.	In	the	video	a	moment	ago	,	you	saw	fleets	of	new	viruses	launching	from	infected	cells	.
Now	realize	that	in	a	recently	infected	person	,	there	are	millions	of	these	ships	;	each	one	is	just	slightly	different	.
Finding	a	weapon	that	recognizes	and	sinks	all	of	them	makes	the	job	that	much	harder	.
Now	,	in	the	27	years	since	HIV	was	identified	as	the	cause	of	AIDS	,	we	've	developed	more	drugs	to	treat	HIV	than	all	other	viruses	put	together	.
These	drugs	are	n't	cures	,	but	they	represent	a	huge	triumph	of	science	because	they	take	away	the	automatic	death	sentence	from	a	diagnosis	of	HIV	,	at	least	for	those	who	can	access	them	.
The	vaccine	effort	though	is	really	quite	different	.
Large	companies	moved	away	from	it	because	they	thought	the	science	was	so	difficult	and	vaccines	were	seen	as	poor	business	.
Many	thought	that	it	was	just	impossible	to	make	an	AIDS	vaccine	,	but	today	,	evidence	tells	us	otherwise	.
In	September	,	we	had	surprising	but	exciting	findings	from	a	clinical	trial	that	took	place	in	Thailand	.
For	the	first	time	,	we	saw	an	AIDS	vaccine	work	in	humans	--	albeit	,	quite	modestly	--
and	that	particular	vaccine	was	made	almost	a	decade	ago	.
Newer	concepts	and	early	testing	now	show	even	greater	promise	in	the	best	of	our	animal	models	.
But	in	the	past	few	months	,	researchers	have	also	isolated	several	new	broadly	neutralizing	antibodies	from	the	blood	of	an	HIV	infected	individual	.
Now	,	what	does	this	mean	?
We	saw	earlier	that	HIV	is	highly	variable	,	that	a	broad	neutralizing	antibody	latches	on	and	disables	multiple	variations	of	the	virus	.
If	you	take	these	and	you	put	them	in	the	best	of	our	monkey	models	,	they	provide	full	protection	from	infection	.
In	addition	,	these	researchers	found	a	new	site	on	HIV	where	the	antibodies	can	grab	onto	,
and	what	's	so	special	about	this	spot	is	that	it	changes	very	little	as	the	virus	mutates	.
It	's	like	,	as	many	times	as	the	virus	changes	its	clothes	,	it	's	still	wearing	the	same	socks	,	and	now	our	job	is	to	make	sure	we	get	the	body	to	really	hate	those	socks	.
So	what	we	've	got	is	a	situation	.
The	Thai	results	tell	us	we	can	make	an	AIDS	vaccine	,
and	the	antibody	findings	tell	us	how	we	might	do	that	.
This	strategy	,	working	backwards
from	an	antibody	to	create	a	vaccine	candidate	,	has	never	been	done	before	in	vaccine	research	.
It	's	called	retro-vaccinology	,	and	its	implications	extend	way	beyond	that	of	just	HIV	.
So	think	of	it	this	way	.
We	've	got	these	new	antibodies	we	've	identified	,	and	we	know	that	they	latch	onto	many	,	many	variations	of	the	virus	.
We	know	that	they	have	to	latch	onto	a	specific	part	,
so	if	we	can	figure	out	the	precise	structure	of	that	part	,	present	that	through	a	vaccine	,	what	we	hope	is	we	can	prompt	your	immune	system	to	make	these	matching	antibodies	.
And	that	would	create	a	universal	HIV	vaccine	.
Now	,	it	sounds	easier	than	it	is	because	the	structure	actually	looks	more	like	this	blue	antibody	diagram	attached	to	its	yellow	binding	site	,
and	as	you	can	imagine	,	these	three-dimensional	structures	are	much	harder	to	work	on	.
And	if	you	guys	have	ideas	to	help	us	solve	this	,	we	'd	love	to	hear	about	it	.
But	,	you	know	,	the	research	that	has	occurred	from	HIV	now	has	really	helped	with	innovation	with	other	diseases	.
So	for	instance	,	a	biotechnology	company	has	now	found	broadly	neutralizing	antibodies	to	influenza	,	as	well	as	a	new	antibody	target	on	the	flu	virus	.
They	're	currently	making	a	cocktail	--	an	antibody	cocktail	--	that	can	be	used	to	treat	severe	,	overwhelming	cases	of	flu	.
In	the	longer	term	,	what	they	can	do	is	use	these	tools	of	retro-vaccinology	to	make	a	preventive	flu	vaccine	.
Now	,	retro-vaccinology	is	just	one	technique	within	the	ambit	of	so-called	rational	vaccine	design	.
Let	me	give	you	another	example	.
We	talked	about	before	the	H	and	N	spikes	on	the	surface	of	the	flu	virus	.
Notice	these	other	,	smaller	protuberances	.
These	are	largely	hidden	from	the	immune	system	.
Now	it	turns	out	that	these	spots	also	do	n't	change	much	when	the	virus	mutates	.
If	you	can	cripple	these	with	specific	antibodies	,	you	could	cripple	all	versions	of	the	flu	.
So	far	,	animal	tests	indicate	that	such	a	vaccine	could	prevent	severe	disease	,	although	you	might	get	a	mild	case	.
So	if	this	works	in	humans	,	what	we	're	talking	about	is	a	universal	flu	vaccine	,	one	that	does	n't	need	to	change	every	year	and	would	remove	the	threat	of	death	.
We	really	could	think	of	flu	,	then	,	as	just	a	bad	cold	.
Of	course	,	the	best	vaccine	imaginable	is	only	valuable	to	the	extent	we	get	it	to	everyone	who	needs	it	.
So	to	do	that	,	we	have	to	combine	smart	vaccine	design	with	smart	production	methods	and	,	of	course	,	smart	delivery	methods	.
So	I	want	you	to	think	back	a	few	months	ago	.
In	June	,	the	World	Health	Organization	declared	the	first	global	flu	pandemic	in	41	years	.
The	U.S.	government	promised	150	million	doses	of	vaccine	by	October	15th	for	the	flu	peak	.
Vaccines	were	promised	to	developing	countries	.
Hundreds	of	millions	of	dollars	were	spent	and	flowed	to	accelerating	vaccine	manufacturing	.
So	what	happened	?
Well	,	we	first	figured	out	how	to	make	flu	vaccines	,	how	to	produce	them	,
in	the	early	1940s	.	It	was	a	slow	,	cumbersome	process	that	depended	on	chicken	eggs	,	millions	of	living	chicken	eggs	.
Viruses	only	grow	in	living	things	,	and	so	it	turned	out	that	,	for	flu	,	chicken	eggs	worked	really	well	.
For	most	strains	,	you	could	get	one	to	two	doses	of	vaccine	per	egg	.
Luckily	for	us	,	we	live	in	an	era	of	breathtaking	biomedical	advances	.
So	today	,	we	get	our	flu	vaccines	from	...
chicken	eggs	,	hundreds	of	millions	of	chicken	eggs	.
Almost	nothing	has	changed	.
The	system	is	reliable
but	the	problem	is	you	never	know	how	well	a	strain	is	going	to	grow	.
This	year	's	swine	flu	strain	grew	very	poorly	in	early	production	:	basically	.6	doses	per	egg	.
So	,	here	's	an	alarming	thought	.
What	if	that	wild	bird	flies	by	again	?
You	could	see	an	avian	strain	that	would	infect	the	poultry	flocks	,	and	then	we	would	have	no	eggs	for	our	vaccines	.
So	,	Dan	[	Barber	]	,	if	you	want	billions	of	chicken	pellets	for	your	fish	farm	,	I	know	where	to	get	them	.
So	right	now	,	the	world	can	produce	about	350	million	doses	of	flu	vaccine	for	the	three	strains	,
and	we	can	up	that	to	about	1.2	billion	doses	if	we	want	to	target	a	single	variant	like	swine	flu	.
But	this	assumes	that	our	factories	are	humming	because	,	in	2004	,	the	U.S.	supply	was	cut	in	half	by	contamination	at	one	single	plant	.
And	the	process	still	takes	more	than	half	a	year	.
So	are	we	better	prepared	than	we	were	in	1918	?
Well	,	with	the	new	technologies	emerging	now	,	I	hope	we	can	say	definitively	,	``	Yes	.	''
Imagine	we	could	produce	enough	flu	vaccine	for	everyone	in	the	entire	world	for	less	than	half	of	what	we	're	currently	spending	now	in	the	United	States	.
With	a	range	of	new	technologies	,	we	could	.
Here	's	an	example	:	A	company	I	'm	engaged	with	has	found	a	specific	piece	of	the	H	spike	of	flu	that	sparks	the	immune	system	.
If	you	lop	this	off	and	attach	it	to	the	tail	of	a	different	bacterium	,	which	creates	a	vigorous	immune	response	,	they	've	created	a	very	powerful	flu	fighter	.
This	vaccine	is	so	small	it	can	be	grown	in	a	common	bacteria	,	E.	coli	.	Now	,	as	you	know	,	bacteria	reproduce	quickly	--
it	's	like	making	yogurt	--
and	so	we	could	produce	enough	swine	origin	flu	for	the	entire	world	in	a	few	factories	,	in	a	few	weeks	,	with	no	eggs	,	for	a	fraction	of	the	cost	of	current	methods	.
So	here	's	a	comparison	of	several	of	these	new	vaccine	technologies	.
And	,	aside	from	the	radically	increased	production	and	huge	cost	savings	--	for	example	,	the	E.	coli	method	I	just	talked	about	--	look	at	the	time	saved	:	this	would	be	lives	saved	.
The	developing	world	,	mostly	left	out	of	the	current	response	,	sees	the	potential	of	these	alternate	technologies	and	they	're	leapfrogging	the	West	.
India	,	Mexico	and	others	are	already	making	experimental	flu	vaccines	,	and	they	may	be	the	first	place	we	see	these	vaccines	in	use	.
Because	these	technologies	are	so	efficient	and	relatively	cheap	,	billions	of	people	can	have	access	to	lifesaving	vaccines	if	we	can	figure	out	how	to	deliver	them	.
Now	think	of	where	this	leads	us	.
New	infectious	diseases	appear	or	reappear	every	few	years	.
Some	day	,	perhaps	soon	,	we	'll	have	a	virus	that	is	going	to	threaten	all	of	us	.
Will	we	be	quick	enough	to	react	before	millions	die	?
Luckily	,	this	year	's	flu	was	relatively	mild	.
I	say	,	``	luckily	''	in	part	because	virtually	no	one	in	the	developing	world	was	vaccinated	.
So	if	we	have	the	political	and	financial	foresight	to	sustain	our	investments	,	we	will	master	these	and	new	tools	of	vaccinology	,
and	with	these	tools	we	can	produce	enough	vaccine	for	everyone	at	low	cost	and	ensure	healthy	productive	lives	.
No	longer	must	flu	have	to	kill	half	a	million	people	a	year	.
No	longer	does	AIDS	need	to	kill	two	million	a	year	.
No	longer	do	the	poor	and	vulnerable	need	to	be	threatened	by	infectious	diseases	,	or	indeed	,	anybody	.
Instead	of	having	Vaclav	Smil	's	``	massively	fatal	discontinuity	''	of	life	,	we	can	ensure	the	continuity	of	life	.
What	the	world	needs	now	are	these	new	vaccines	,	and	we	can	make	it	happen	.
Thank	you	very	much	.
Chris	Anderson	:	Thank	you	.
Thank	you	.	So	,	the	science	is	changing	.
In	your	mind	,	Seth	--	I	mean	,	you	must	dream	about	this	--	what	is	the	kind	of	time	scale	on	,	let	's	start	with	HIV	,	for	a	game-changing	vaccine	that	's	actually	out	there	and	usable	?
SB	:	The	game	change	can	come	at	any	time	,	because	the	problem	we	have	now	is	we	've	shown	we	can	get	a	vaccine	to	work	in	humans	;	we	just	need	a	better	one	.
And	with	these	types	of	antibodies	,	we	know	humans	can	make	them	.
So	,	if	we	can	figure	out	how	to	do	that	,	then	we	have	the	vaccine	,	and	what	's	interesting	is	there	already	is	some	evidence	that	we	're	beginning	to	crack	that	problem	.
So	,	the	challenge	is	full	speed	ahead	.
CA	:	In	your	gut	,	do	you	think	it	's	probably	going	to	be	at	least	another	five	years	?
SB	:	You	know	,	everybody	says	it	's	10	years	,	but	it	's	been	10	years	every	10	years	.
So	I	hate	to	put	a	timeline	on	scientific	innovation	,	but	the	investments	that	have	occurred	are	now	paying	dividends	.
CA	:	And	that	's	the	same	with	universal	flu	vaccine	,	the	same	kind	of	thing	?
SB	:	I	think	flu	is	different	.	I	think	what	happened	with	flu	is	we	've	got	a	bunch	--	I	just	showed	some	of	this	--	a	bunch	of	really	cool	and	useful	technologies	that	are	ready	to	go	now	.
They	look	good	.	The	problem	has	been	that	,	what	we	did	is	we	invested	in	traditional	technologies	because	that	's	what	we	were	comfortable	with	.
You	also	can	use	adjuvants	,	which	are	chemicals	you	mix	.
That	's	what	Europe	is	doing	,	so	we	could	have	diluted	out	our	supply	of	flu	and	made	more	available	,
but	,	going	back	to	what	Michael	Specter	said	,	the	anti-vaccine	crowd	did	n't	really	want	that	to	happen	.
CA	:	And	malaria	's	even	further	behind	?
SB	:	No	,	malaria	,	there	is	a	candidate	that	actually	showed	efficacy	in	an	earlier	trial	and	is	currently	in	phase	three	trials	now	.
It	probably	is	n't	the	perfect	vaccine	,	but	it	's	moving	along	.
CA	:	Seth	,	most	of	us	do	work	where	every	month	,	we	produce	something	;	we	get	that	kind	of	gratification	.
You	've	been	slaving	away	at	this	for	more	than	a	decade	,	and	I	salute	you	and	your	colleagues	for	what	you	do	.
The	world	needs	people	like	you	.	Thank	you	.
SB	:	Thank	you	.
Well	,	first	of	all	,	let	me	thank	Emeka	--	as	a	matter	of	fact	,	TED	Global	--	for	putting	this	conference	together	.
This	conference	is	going	to	rank	as	the	most	important	in	the	beginning	of	the	21st	century	.
Think	African	governments	will	put	together	a	conference	like	this	?
You	think	the	A.U	.	will	put	together	a	conference	like	this	?
Even	before	they	do	that	they	will	ask	for	foreign	aid	.
I	would	also	like	to	pay	homage	and	honor	to	the	TED	Fellows	June	Arunga	,	James	Shikwati	,	Andrew	,	and	the	other	TED	Fellows	.
I	call	them	the	Cheetah	Generation	.
The	Cheetah	Generation	is	a	new	breed	of	Africans	who	brook	no	nonsense	about	corruption	.
They	understand	what	accountability	and	democracy	is	.
They	're	not	going	to	wait	for	government	to	do	things	for	them	.
That	's	the	Cheetah	Generation	,
and	Africa	's	salvation	rests	on	the	backs	of	these	Cheetahs	.
In	contrast	,	of	course	,	we	have	the	Hippo	Generation	.
The	Hippo	Generation	are	the	ruling	elites	.	They	are	stuck	in	their	intellectual	patch	.	Complaining	about	colonialism	and	imperialism	,	they	would	n't	move	one	foot	.
If	you	ask	them	to	reform	the	economies	,	they	're	not	going	to	reform	it	because	they	benefit	from	the	rotten	status	quo	.
Now	,	there	are	a	lot	of	Africans	who	are	very	angry	,	angry	at	the	condition	of	Africa	.
Now	,	we	're	talking	about	a	continent	that	is	not	poor	.
It	is	rich	in	mineral	resources	,	natural	mineral	resources	.
But	the	mineral	wealth	of	Africa	is	not	being	utilized	to	lift	its	people	out	of	poverty	.
That	's	what	makes	a	lot	of	Africans	very	angry	.	And	in	a	way	,	Africa	is	more	than	a	tragedy	,	in	more	ways	than	one	.
There	's	another	enduring	tragedy	,	and	that	tragedy	is	that	there	are	so	many	people	,	so	many	governments	,	so	many	organizations	who	want	to	help	the	people	in	Africa	.	They	do	n't	understand	.
Now	,	we	're	not	saying	do	n't	help	Africa	.
Helping	Africa	is	noble	.
But	helping	Africa	has	been	turned	into	a	theater	of	the	absurd	.
It	's	like	the	blind	leading	the	clueless	.
There	are	certain	things	that	we	need	to	recognize	.
Africa	's	begging-bowl	leaks	.
Did	you	know	that	40	percent	of	the	wealth	created	in	Africa	is	not	invested	here	in	Africa	?
It	's	taken	out	of	Africa	.
That	's	what	the	World	Bank	says	.
Look	at	Africa	's	begging-bowl	.
It	leaks	horribly	.
There	are	people	who	think	that	we	should	pour	more	money	,	more	aid	into	this	bowl	which	leaks	.
What	are	the	leakages	?
Corruption	alone	costs	Africa	148	billion	dollars	a	year	.
Yes	,	put	that	aside	.
Capital	flight	out	of	Africa	,	80	billion	a	year	.
Put	that	aside	.
Let	's	take	food	imports	.
Every	year	Africa	spends	20	billion	dollars	to	import	food	.	Just	add	that	up	,	all	these	leakages	.
That	's	far	more	than	the	50	billion	Tony	Blair	wants	to	raise	for	Africa	.
Now	,	back	in	the	1960s	Africa	not	only	fed	itself	,	it	also	exported	food	.
Not	anymore	.
We	know	that	something	has	gone	fundamentally	wrong	.	You	know	it	,	I	know	it	,	but	let	's	not	waste	our	time	talking	about	these	mistakes	because	we	'll	spend	all	day	here	.
Let	's	move	on	,	and	flip	over	to	the	next	chapter	,
and	that	's	what	this	conference	is	all	about	--	the	next	chapter	.
The	next	chapter	begins	with	first	of	all	,	asking	ourselves	this	fundamental	question	,	``	Whom	do	we	want	to	help	in	Africa	?	''
There	is	the	people	,	and	then	there	is	the	government	or	leaders	.
Now	,	the	previous	speaker	before	me	,	Idris	Mohammed	,	indicated	that	we	've	had	abysmal	leadership	in	Africa	.
That	characterization	,	in	my	view	,	is	even	more	charitable	.
I	belong	to	an	Internet	discussion	forum	,	an	African	Internet	discussion	forum	,	and	I	asked	them	,	I	said	,	``	Since	1960	,	we	've	had	exactly	204	African	heads	of	state	,	since	1960	.	''
And	I	asked	them	to	name	me	just	20	good	leaders	,	just	20	good	leaders	--	you	may	want	to	take	this	leadership	challenge	yourself	.
I	asked	them	to	name	me	just	20	.
Everybody	mentioned	Nelson	Mandela	,	of	course	.
Kwame	Nkrumah	,	Nyerere	,	Kenyatta	--	somebody	mentioned	Idi	Amin	.	I	let	that	pass	.
My	point	is	,	they	could	n't	go	beyond	15	.
Even	if	they	had	been	able	to	name	me	20	,	what	does	that	tell	you	?
20	out	of	204	means	that	the	vast	majority	of	the	African	leaders	failed	their	people	.
And	if	you	look	at	them	,	the	slate	of	the	post-colonial	leaders	--	an	assortment	of	military	fufu	heads	,
Swiss-bank	socialists	,	crocodile	liberators	,	vampire	elites	,	quack	revolutionaries	.
Now	,	this	leadership	is	a	far	cry	from	the	traditional	leaders	that	Africans	have	known	for	centuries	.
The	second	false	premise	that	we	make	when	we	're	trying	to	help	Africa	is	that	sometimes	we	think	that	there	is	something	called	a	government	in	Africa	that	cares	about	its	people	,	serves	the	interests	of	the	people	,	and	represents	the	people	.
There	is	one	particular	quote	--	a	Lesotho	chief	once	said	that	``	Here	in	Lesotho	,	we	've	got	two	problems	:	rats	and	the	government	.	''
What	you	and	I	understand	as	a	government	does	n't	exist	in	many	African	countries	.
In	fact	,	what	we	call	our	governments	are	vampire	states	.
Vampires	because	they	suck	the	economic	vitality	out	of	their	people	.
Government	is	the	problem	in	Africa	.
A	vampire	state	is	the	government	--	--	which	has	been	hijacked	by	a	phalanx	of	bandits	and	crooks	who	use	the	instruments	of	state	power	to	enrich	themselves	,	their	cronies	,	and	tribesmen	and	exclude	everybody	else	.
The	richest	people	in	Africa	are	heads-of-state	and	ministers	,	and	quite	often	the	chief	bandit	is	the	head-of-state	himself	.
Where	do	they	get	their	money	?
By	creating	wealth	?
No	.
By	raking	it	off	the	backs	of	their	suffering	people	.
That	's	not	wealth	creation	.	It	's	wealth	redistribution	.
The	third	fundamental	issue	that	we	have	to	recognize	is	that	if	we	want	to	help	the	African	people	,	we	must	know	where	the	African	people	are	.
Take	any	African	economy	.
An	African	economy	can	be	broken	up	into	three	sectors	.
There	is	the	modern	sector	,	there	is	the	informal	sector	and	the	traditional	sector	.
The	modern	sector	is	the	abode	of	the	elites	.
It	's	the	seat	of	government	.
In	many	African	countries	the	modern	sector	is	lost	.
It	's	dysfunctional	.
It	is	a	meretricious	fandango	of	imported	systems	,	which	the	elites	themselves	do	n't	understand	.
That	is	the	source	of	many	of	Africa	's	problems	where	the	struggles	for	political	power	emanate	and	then	spill	over	onto	the	informal	and	the	traditional	sector	,	claiming	innocent	lives	.
Now	the	modern	sector	,	of	course	,	is	where	a	lot	of	the	development	aid	and	resources	went	into	.
More	than	80	percent	of	Ivory	Coast	's	development	went	into	the	modern	sector	.
The	other	sectors	,	the	informal	and	the	traditional	sectors	,	are	where	you	find	the	majority	of	the	African	people	,
the	real	people	in	Africa	.	That	's	where	you	find	them	.
Now	,	obviously	it	makes	common	sense	that	if	you	want	to	help	the	people	,	you	go	where	the	people	are	.
But	that	's	not	what	we	did	.
As	a	matter	of	fact	,	we	neglected	the	informal	and	the	traditional	sectors	.
Now	,	traditional	sector	is	where	Africa	produces	its	agriculture	,	which	is	one	of	the	reasons	why	Africa	ca	n't	feed	itself	,	and	that	's	why	it	must	import	food	.
All	right	,	you	can	not	develop	Africa	by	ignoring	the	informal	and	the	traditional	sectors	.
And	you	ca	n't	develop	the	informal	and	the	traditional	sectors	without	an	operational	understanding	of	how	these	two	sectors	work	.
These	two	sectors	,	let	me	describe	to	you	,	have	their	own	indigenous	institutions	.
First	one	is	the	political	system	.
Traditionally	,	Africans	hate	governments	.	They	hate	tyranny	.
If	you	look	into	their	traditional	systems	,	Africans	organize	their	states	in	two	types	.
The	first	one	belongs	to	those	ethnic	societies	who	believe	that	the	state	was	necessarily	tyrannous	,	so	they	did	n't	want	to	have	anything	to	do	with	any	centralized	authority	.
These	societies	are	the	Ibo	,	the	Somali	,	the	Kikuyus	,	for	example	.	They	have	no	chiefs	.
The	other	ethnic	groups	,	which	did	have	chiefs	,	made	sure	that	they	surrounded	the	chiefs	with	councils	upon	councils	upon	councils	to	prevent	them	from	abusing	their	power	.
In	Ashanti	tradition	,	for	example	,	the	chief	can	not	make	any	decision	without	the	concurrence	of	the	council	of	elders	.
Without	the	council	the	chief	ca	n't	pass	any	law	,	and	if	the	chief	does	n't	govern	according	to	the	will	of	the	people	he	will	be	removed	.
If	not	,	the	people	will	abandon	the	chief	,	go	somewhere	else	and	set	up	a	new	settlement	.
And	even	if	you	look	in	ancient	African	empires	,	they	were	all	organized	around	one	particular	principle	--	the	confederacy	principle	,	which	is	characterized	by	a	great	deal	of	devolution	of	authority	,	decentralization	of	power	.
Now	,	this	is	what	I	have	described	to	you	.	This	is	part	of	Africa	's	indigenous	political	heritage	.
Now	,	compare	that	to	the	modern	systems	the	ruling	elites	established	on	Africa	.
It	is	a	total	far	cry	.
In	the	economic	system	in	traditional	Africa	,	the	means	of	production	is	privately	owned	.
It	's	owned	by	extended	families	.
You	see	,	in	the	West	,	the	basic	economic	and	social	unit	is	the	individual	.
The	American	will	say	,	``	I	am	because	I	am	,	and	I	can	damn	well	do	anything	I	want	,	anytime	.	''
The	accent	is	on	the	``	I	.	''
In	Africa	,	the	Africans	say	,	``	I	am	,	because	we	are	.	''
The	``	we	''	connotes	community	--	the	extended	family	system	.
The	extended	family	system	pools	its	resources	together	.
They	own	farms	.	They	decide	what	to	do	,	what	to	produce	.
They	do	n't	take	any	orders	from	their	chiefs	.	They	decide	what	to	do	.
And	when	they	produce	their	crops	,	they	sell	the	surplus	on	marketplaces	.
When	they	make	a	profit	it	is	theirs	to	keep	,	not	for	the	chief	to	sequester	it	from	them	.
So	,	in	a	nutshell	,	what	we	had	in	traditional	Africa	was	a	free-market	system	.
There	were	markets	in	Africa	before	the	colonialists	stepped	foot	on	the	continent	.
Timbuktu	was	one	great	big	market	town	.
Kano	,	Salaga	--	they	were	all	there	.
Even	if	you	go	to	West	Africa	,	you	notice	that	market	activity	in	West	Africa	has	always	been	dominated	by	women	.
So	,	it	's	quite	appropriate	that	this	section	is	called	a	marketplace	.
The	market	is	not	alien	to	Africa	.
What	Africans	practiced	was	a	different	form	of	capitalism	,	but	then	after	independence	,	all	of	a	sudden	,	markets	,	capitalism	became	a	western	institution	,	and	the	leaders	said	Africans	were	ready	for	socialism	.
Nonsense	.
And	even	then	,	what	kind	of	socialism	did	they	practice	?
The	socialism	that	they	practiced	was	a	peculiar	form	of	Swiss-bank	socialism	,	which	allowed	the	heads	of	states	and	the	ministers	to	rape	and	plunder	Africa	's	treasuries	for	deposit	in	Switzerland	.
That	is	not	the	kind	of	system	Africans	had	known	for	centuries	.
What	do	we	do	now	?
Go	back	to	Africa	's	indigenous	institutions	,	and	this	is	where	we	charge	the	Cheetahs	to	go	into	the	informal	sectors	,	the	traditional	sectors	.	That	's	where	you	find	the	African	people	.
And	I	'd	like	to	show	you	a	quick	little	video	about	the	informal	sector	,	about	the	boat-building	that	I	,	myself	,	tried	to	mobilize	Africans	in	the	Diaspora	to	invest	in	.
Could	you	please	show	that	?
The	men	are	going	fishing	in	these	small	boats	.
Yes	,	it	's	an	enterprise	.
This	is	by	a	local	Ghanaian	entrepreneur	,	using	his	own	capital	.
He	's	getting	no	assistance	from	the	government	,	and	he	's	building	a	second	,	bigger	boat	.
A	bigger	boat	will	mean	more	fish	will	be	caught	and	landed	.
It	means	that	he	will	be	able	to	employ	more	Ghanaians	.
It	also	means	that	he	will	be	able	to	generate	wealth	.
And	then	it	will	have	what	economists	call	external	effects	on	a	local	economy	.
All	that	you	need	to	do	,	all	that	the	elites	need	to	do	,	is	to	move	this	operation	into	something	that	is	enclosed	so	that	the	operation	can	be	made	more	efficient	.
Now	,	it	is	not	just	this	informal	sector	.	There	is	also	traditional	medicine	.
80	percent	of	Africans	still	rely	on	traditional	medicine	.
The	modern	healthcare	sector	has	totally	collapsed	.	Now	,	this	is	an	area	--	I	mean	,	there	is	a	treasure	trove	of	wealth	in	the	traditional	medicine	area	.
This	is	where	we	need	to	mobilize	Africans	,	in	the	Diaspora	especially	,	to	invest	in	this	.
We	also	need	to	mobilize	Africans	in	the	Diaspora	,	not	only	to	go	into	the	traditional	sectors	,	but	to	go	into	agriculture	and	also	to	instigate	change	from	within	.
We	were	able	to	mobilize	Ghanaians	in	the	Diaspora	to	instigate	change	in	Ghana	and	bring	about	democracy	in	Ghana	.
And	I	know	that	with	the	Cheetahs	,	we	can	take	Africa	back	one	village	at	a	time	.
Thank	you	very	much	.
Basically	,	there	's	a	major	demographic	event	going	on	.
And	it	may	be	that	passing	the	50	percent	urban	point	is	an	economic	tipping	point	.	So	the	world	now	is	a	map	of	connectivity	.
It	used	to	be	that	Paris	and	London	and	New	York	were	the	largest	cities	.
What	we	have	now	is	the	end	of	the	rise	of	the	West	.	That	's	over	.
The	aggregate	numbers	are	overwhelming	.
So	what	's	really	going	on	?	Well	,	villages	of	the	world	are	emptying	out	.
The	question	is	,	why	?
And	here	's	the	unromantic	truth	--	and	the	city	air	makes	you	free	,	they	said	in	Renaissance	Germany	.	So	some	people	go	to	places	like	Shanghai	but	most	go	to	the	squatter	cities	where	aesthetics	rule	.
And	these	are	not	really	a	people	oppressed	by	poverty	.
They	're	people	getting	out	of	poverty	as	fast	as	they	can	.
They	're	the	dominant	builders	and	to	a	large	extent	,	the	dominant	designers	.
They	have	home-brewed	infrastructure	and	vibrant	urban	life	.
One-sixth	of	the	GDP	in	India	is	coming	out	of	Mumbai	.
They	are	constantly	upgrading	,	and	in	a	few	cases	,	the	government	helps	.
Education	is	the	main	event	that	can	happen	in	cities	.
What	's	going	on	in	the	street	in	Mumbai	?
Al	Gore	knows	.	It	's	basically	everything	.
There	's	no	unemployment	in	squatter	cities	.	Everyone	works	.
One-sixth	of	humanity	is	there	.	It	's	soon	going	to	be	more	than	that	.
So	here	's	the	first	punch	line	:
cities	have	defused	the	population	bomb	.
And	here	's	the	second	punch	line	.
That	's	the	news	from	downtown	.	Here	it	is	in	perspective	.
Stars	have	shined	down	on	earth	's	life	for	billions	of	years	.
Now	we	're	shining	right	back	up	.
Thank	you	.
Mark	Zuckerberg	,	a	journalist	was	asking	him	a	question	about	the	news	feed	.
And	the	journalist	was	asking	him	,	``	Why	is	this	so	important	?	''
And	Zuckerberg	said	,	``	A	squirrel	dying	in	your	front	yard	may	be	more	relevant	to	your	interests	right	now	than	people	dying	in	Africa	.	''
And	I	want	to	talk	about	what	a	Web	based	on	that	idea	of	relevance	might	look	like	.
So	when	I	was	growing	up	in	a	really	rural	area	in	Maine	,	the	Internet	meant	something	very	different	to	me	.
It	meant	a	connection	to	the	world	.
It	meant	something	that	would	connect	us	all	together	.
And	I	was	sure	that	it	was	going	to	be	great	for	democracy	and	for	our	society	.
But	there	's	this	shift	in	how	information	is	flowing	online	,	and	it	's	invisible	.
And	if	we	do	n't	pay	attention	to	it	,	it	could	be	a	real	problem	.
So	I	first	noticed	this	in	a	place	I	spend	a	lot	of	time	--	my	Facebook	page	.
I	'm	progressive	,	politically	--	big	surprise	--	but	I	've	always	gone	out	of	my	way	to	meet	conservatives	.
I	like	hearing	what	they	're	thinking	about	;	I	like	seeing	what	they	link	to	;	I	like	learning	a	thing	or	two	.
And	so	I	was	surprised	when	I	noticed	one	day	that	the	conservatives	had	disappeared	from	my	Facebook	feed	.
And	what	it	turned	out	was	going	on	was	that	Facebook	was	looking	at	which	links	I	clicked	on	,	and	it	was	noticing	that	,	actually	,	I	was	clicking	more	on	my	liberal	friends	'	links	than	on	my	conservative	friends	'	links	.
And	without	consulting	me	about	it	,	it	had	edited	them	out	.
They	disappeared	.
So	Facebook	is	n't	the	only	place	that	's	doing	this	kind	of	invisible	,	algorithmic	editing	of	the	Web	.
Google	's	doing	it	too	.
If	I	search	for	something	,	and	you	search	for	something	,	even	right	now	at	the	very	same	time	,	we	may	get	very	different	search	results	.
Even	if	you	're	logged	out	,	one	engineer	told	me	,	there	are	57	signals	that	Google	looks	at	--	everything	from	what	kind	of	computer	you	're	on	to	what	kind	of	browser	you	're	using	to	where	you	're	located	--	that	it	uses	to	personally	tailor	your	query	results	.
Think	about	it	for	a	second	:	there	is	no	standard	Google	anymore	.
And	you	know	,	the	funny	thing	about	this	is	that	it	's	hard	to	see	.
You	ca	n't	see	how	different	your	search	results	are	from	anyone	else	's	.
But	a	couple	of	weeks	ago	,	I	asked	a	bunch	of	friends	to	Google	``	Egypt	''	and	to	send	me	screen	shots	of	what	they	got	.
So	here	's	my	friend	Scott	's	screen	shot	.
And	here	's	my	friend	Daniel	's	screen	shot	.
When	you	put	them	side-by-side	,	you	do	n't	even	have	to	read	the	links	to	see	how	different	these	two	pages	are	.
But	when	you	do	read	the	links	,	it	's	really	quite	remarkable	.
Daniel	did	n't	get	anything	about	the	protests	in	Egypt	at	all	in	his	first	page	of	Google	results	.
Scott	's	results	were	full	of	them	.
And	this	was	the	big	story	of	the	day	at	that	time	.
That	's	how	different	these	results	are	becoming	.
So	it	's	not	just	Google	and	Facebook	either	.
This	is	something	that	's	sweeping	the	Web	.
There	are	a	whole	host	of	companies	that	are	doing	this	kind	of	personalization	.
Yahoo	News	,	the	biggest	news	site	on	the	Internet	,	is	now	personalized	--	different	people	get	different	things	.
Huffington	Post	,	the	Washington	Post	,	the	New	York	Times	--	all	flirting	with	personalization	in	various	ways	.
And	this	moves	us	very	quickly	toward	a	world	in	which	the	Internet	is	showing	us	what	it	thinks	we	want	to	see	,	but	not	necessarily	what	we	need	to	see	.
As	Eric	Schmidt	said	,	``	It	will	be	very	hard	for	people	to	watch	or	consume	something	that	has	not	in	some	sense	been	tailored	for	them	.	''
So	I	do	think	this	is	a	problem	.
And	I	think	,	if	you	take	all	of	these	filters	together	,	you	take	all	these	algorithms	,	you	get	what	I	call	a	filter	bubble	.
And	your	filter	bubble	is	your	own	personal	,	unique	universe	of	information	that	you	live	in	online	.
And	what	's	in	your	filter	bubble	depends	on	who	you	are	,	and	it	depends	on	what	you	do	.
But	the	thing	is	that	you	do	n't	decide	what	gets	in	.
And	more	importantly	,	you	do	n't	actually	see	what	gets	edited	out	.
So	one	of	the	problems	with	the	filter	bubble	was	discovered	by	some	researchers	at	Netflix	.
And	they	were	looking	at	the	Netflix	queues	,	and	they	noticed	something	kind	of	funny	that	a	lot	of	us	probably	have	noticed	,	which	is	there	are	some	movies	that	just	sort	of	zip	right	up	and	out	to	our	houses	.
They	enter	the	queue	,	they	just	zip	right	out	.
So	``	Iron	Man	''	zips	right	out	,	and	``	Waiting	for	Superman	''	can	wait	for	a	really	long	time	.
What	they	discovered	was	that	in	our	Netflix	queues	there	's	this	epic	struggle	going	on	between	our	future	aspirational	selves	and	our	more	impulsive	present	selves	.
You	know	we	all	want	to	be	someone	who	has	watched	``	Rashomon	,	''	but	right	now	we	want	to	watch	``	Ace	Ventura	''	for	the	fourth	time	.
So	the	best	editing	gives	us	a	bit	of	both	.
It	gives	us	a	little	bit	of	Justin	Bieber	and	a	little	bit	of	Afghanistan	.
It	gives	us	some	information	vegetables	;	it	gives	us	some	information	dessert	.
And	the	challenge	with	these	kinds	of	algorithmic	filters	,	these	personalized	filters	,	is	that	,	because	they	're	mainly	looking	at	what	you	click	on	first	,	it	can	throw	off	that	balance	.
And	instead	of	a	balanced	information	diet	,	you	can	end	up	surrounded	by	information	junk	food	.
What	this	suggests	is	actually	that	we	may	have	the	story	about	the	Internet	wrong	.
In	a	broadcast	society	--	this	is	how	the	founding	mythology	goes	--	in	a	broadcast	society	,	there	were	these	gatekeepers	,	the	editors	,	and	they	controlled	the	flows	of	information	.
And	along	came	the	Internet	and	it	swept	them	out	of	the	way	,	and	it	allowed	all	of	us	to	connect	together	,	and	it	was	awesome	.
But	that	's	not	actually	what	's	happening	right	now	.
What	we	're	seeing	is	more	of	a	passing	of	the	torch	from	human	gatekeepers	to	algorithmic	ones	.
And	the	thing	is	that	the	algorithms	do	n't	yet	have	the	kind	of	embedded	ethics	that	the	editors	did	.
So	if	algorithms	are	going	to	curate	the	world	for	us	,	if	they	're	going	to	decide	what	we	get	to	see	and	what	we	do	n't	get	to	see	,	then	we	need	to	make	sure	that	they	're	not	just	keyed	to	relevance	.
We	need	to	make	sure	that	they	also	show	us	things	that	are	uncomfortable	or	challenging	or	important	--	this	is	what	TED	does	--	other	points	of	view	.
And	the	thing	is	,	we	've	actually	been	here	before	as	a	society	.
In	1915	,	it	's	not	like	newspapers	were	sweating	a	lot	about	their	civic	responsibilities	.
Then	people	noticed	that	they	were	doing	something	really	important	.
That	,	in	fact	,	you	could	n't	have	a	functioning	democracy	if	citizens	did	n't	get	a	good	flow	of	information	,
that	the	newspapers	were	critical	because	they	were	acting	as	the	filter	,	and	then	journalistic	ethics	developed	.
It	was	n't	perfect	,	but	it	got	us	through	the	last	century	.
And	so	now	,	we	're	kind	of	back	in	1915	on	the	Web	.
And	we	need	the	new	gatekeepers	to	encode	that	kind	of	responsibility	into	the	code	that	they	're	writing	.
I	know	that	there	are	a	lot	of	people	here	from	Facebook	and	from	Google	--	Larry	and	Sergey	--	people	who	have	helped	build	the	Web	as	it	is	,	and	I	'm	grateful	for	that	.
But	we	really	need	you	to	make	sure	that	these	algorithms	have	encoded	in	them	a	sense	of	the	public	life	,	a	sense	of	civic	responsibility	.
We	need	you	to	make	sure	that	they	're	transparent	enough	that	we	can	see	what	the	rules	are	that	determine	what	gets	through	our	filters	.
And	we	need	you	to	give	us	some	control	so	that	we	can	decide	what	gets	through	and	what	does	n't	.
Because	I	think	we	really	need	the	Internet	to	be	that	thing	that	we	all	dreamed	of	it	being	.
We	need	it	to	connect	us	all	together	.
We	need	it	to	introduce	us	to	new	ideas	and	new	people	and	different	perspectives	.
And	it	's	not	going	to	do	that	if	it	leaves	us	all	isolated	in	a	Web	of	one	.
Thank	you	.
Thank	you	so	much	,	Chris	.	And	it	's	truly	a	great	honor	to	have	the	opportunity	to	come	to	this	stage	twice	.	I	'm	extremely	grateful	.
I	have	been	blown	away	by	this	conference	,	and	I	want	to	thank	all	of	you	for	the	many	nice	comments	about	what	I	had	to	say	the	other	night	.
And	I	say	that	sincerely	,	partly	because	--	--	I	need	that	!	Put	yourselves	in	my	position	!
I	flew	on	Air	Force	Two	for	eight	years	.
Now	I	have	to	take	off	my	shoes	or	boots	to	get	on	an	airplane	!
I	'll	tell	you	one	quick	story	to	illustrate	what	that	's	been	like	for	me	.
It	's	a	true	story	--	every	bit	of	this	is	true	.
Soon	after	Tipper	and	I	left	the	--	--	White	House	--	--	we	were	driving	from	our	home	in	Nashville	to	a	little	farm	we	have	50	miles	east	of	Nashville	--	driving	ourselves	.
I	know	it	sounds	like	a	little	thing	to	you	,	but	--	--	I	looked	in	the	rearview	mirror	and	all	of	a	sudden	it	just	hit	me	.
There	was	no	motorcade	back	there	.
You	've	heard	of	phantom	limb	pain	?	This	was	a	rented	Ford	Taurus	.	It	was	dinnertime	,	and	we	started	looking	for	a	place	to	eat	.
We	were	on	I-40	.	We	got	to	Exit	238	,	Lebanon	,	Tennessee	.
We	got	off	the	exit	,	started	looking	for	a	--	we	found	a	Shoney	's	restaurant	.
Low-cost	family	restaurant	chain	,	for	those	of	you	who	do	n't	know	it	.
We	went	in	and	sat	down	at	the	booth	,	and	the	waitress	came	over	,
made	a	big	commotion	over	Tipper	.	She	took	our	order	,	and	then	went	to	the	couple	in	the	booth	next	to	us	,
and	she	lowered	her	voice	so	much	I	had	to	really	strain	to	hear	what	she	was	saying	.
She	said	``	Yes	,	that	's	former	Vice	President	Al	Gore	and	his	wife	Tipper	.	''	And	the	man	said	,	``	He	's	come	down	a	long	way	,	has	n't	he	?	''	There	's	been	kind	of	a	series	of	epiphanies	.
The	very	next	day	,	continuing	a	totally	true	story	,
I	got	on	a	G-5	to	fly	to	Africa	to	make	a	speech	in	Nigeria	,	in	the	city	of	Lagos	,	on	the	topic	of	energy	.
I	began	the	speech	by	telling	them	the	story	of	what	had	just	happened	the	day	before	in	Nashville	.
I	told	it	pretty	much	the	same	way	I	've	just	shared	it	with	you	:
Tipper	and	I	were	driving	ourselves	,	Shoney	's	,	low-cost	family	restaurant	chain	,	what	the	man	said	--	they	laughed	.
I	gave	my	speech	,	then	went	back	out	to	the	airport	to	fly	back	home	.
I	fell	asleep	on	the	plane	,	until	during	the	middle	of	the	night	,	we	landed	on	the	Azores	Islands	for	refueling	.
I	woke	up	,	they	opened	the	door	,	I	went	out	to	get	some	fresh	air	,
and	I	looked	and	there	was	a	man	running	across	the	runway	.
And	he	was	waving	a	piece	of	paper	,	and	he	was	yelling	,	``	Call	Washington	!	Call	Washington	!	''
And	I	thought	to	myself	,	in	the	middle	of	the	night	,	in	the	middle	of	the	Atlantic	,	what	in	the	world	could	be	wrong	in	Washington	?
Then	I	remembered	it	could	be	a	bunch	of	things	.
But	what	it	turned	out	to	be	was	that	my	staff	was	extremely	upset	because	one	of	the	wire	services	in	Nigeria	had	already	written	a	story	about	my	speech	.
And	it	had	already	been	printed	in	cities	all	across	the	United	States	of	America
--	it	was	printed	in	Monterey	,	I	checked	.	And	the	story	began	,	``	Former	Vice	President	Al	Gore	announced	in	Nigeria	yesterday	,	'My	wife	Tipper	and	I	have	opened	a	low-cost	family	restaurant	,	named	Shoney	's	,	and	we	are	running	it	ourselves	.	'	''	Before	I	could	get	back	to	U.S.	soil	,	David	Letterman	and	Jay	Leno	had	already	started	in	on	--	one	of	them	had	me	in	a	big	white	chef	's	hat	,	Tipper	was	saying	,	``	One	more	burger	,	with	fries	!	''
Three	days	later	,	I	got	a	nice	,	long	,	handwritten	letter	from	my	friend	and	partner	and	colleague	Bill	Clinton	saying	,	``	Congratulations	on	the	new	restaurant	,	Al	!	''
We	like	to	celebrate	each	other	's	successes	in	life	.
I	was	going	to	talk	about	information	ecology	.
But	I	was	thinking	that	since	I	plan	to	make	a	lifelong	habit	of	coming	back	to	TED	,	that	maybe	I	could	talk	about	that	another	time	.	Chris	Anderson	:	It	's	a	deal	!
Al	Gore	:	I	want	to	focus	on	what	many	of	you	have	said	you	would	like	me	to	elaborate	on	.
What	can	you	do	about	the	climate	crisis	?	I	want	to	start	with	--	I	'm	going	to	show	some	new	images	,	and	I	'm	going	to	recapitulate	just	four	or	five	.
Now	,	the	slide	show	.	I	update	the	slide	show	every	time	I	give	it	.
I	add	new	images	because	I	learn	more	about	it	every	time	I	give	it	.
It	's	like	beachcombing	,	you	know	?	Every	time	the	tide	comes	in	and	out	,	you	find	some	more	shells	.
Just	in	the	last	two	days	,	we	got	the	new	temperature	records	in	January	.
This	is	just	for	the	United	States	of	America	.	Historical	average	for	January	is	31	degrees	.	Last	month	was	39.5	degrees	.
Now	,	I	know	that	you	wanted	some	more	bad	news	about	the	environment	--	I	'm	kidding	--	but	these	are	the	recapitulation	slides	,	and	then	I	'm	going	to	go	into	new	material	about	what	you	can	do	.
But	I	wanted	to	elaborate	on	a	couple	of	these	.
First	of	all	,	this	is	where	we	're	projected	to	go	with	the	U.S.	contribution	to	global	warming	,	under	business	as	usual	.	Efficiency	in	end-use	electricity	and	end-use	of	all	energy	is	the	low-hanging	fruit	.	Efficiency	and	conservation	:	it	's	not	a	cost	;	it	's	a	profit	.	The	sign	is	wrong	.
It	's	not	negative	;	it	's	positive	.	These	are	investments	that	pay	for	themselves	.
But	they	are	also	very	effective	in	deflecting	our	path	.
Cars	and	trucks	--	I	talked	about	that	in	the	slideshow	,	but	I	want	you	to	put	it	in	perspective	.
It	's	an	easy	,	visible	target	of	concern	,	and	it	should	be	,	but	there	is	more	global	warming	pollution	that	comes	from	buildings	than	from	cars	and	trucks	.
Cars	and	trucks	are	very	significant	,	and	we	have	the	lowest	standards	in	the	world	,	and	so	we	should	address	that	.	But	it	's	part	of	the	puzzle	.
Other	transportation	efficiency	is	as	important	as	cars	and	trucks	!
Renewables	at	the	current	levels	of	technological	efficiency	can	make	this	much	difference	,	and	with	what	Vinod	,	and	John	Doerr	,	and	others	,	many	of	you	here	--	a	lot	of	people	directly	involved	in	this	--	this	wedge	is	going	to	grow	much	more	rapidly	than	the	current	projection	shows	it	.
Carbon	Capture	and	Sequestration	--	that	's	what	CCS	stands	for	--	is	likely	to	become	the	killer	app	that	will	enable	us	to	continue	to	use	fossil	fuels	in	a	way	that	is	safe	.
Not	quite	there	yet	.
OK.	Now	,	what	can	you	do	?	Reduce	emissions	in	your	home	.
Most	of	these	expenditures	are	also	profitable	.
Insulation	,	better	design	,	buy	green	electricity	where	you	can	.
I	mentioned	automobiles	--	buy	a	hybrid	.	Use	light	rail	.
Figure	out	some	of	the	other	options	that	are	much	better	.	It	's	important	.
Be	a	green	consumer	.	You	have	choices	with	everything	you	buy	,	between	things	that	have	a	harsh	effect	or	a	much	less	harsh	effect	on	the	global	climate	crisis	.
Consider	this	.	Make	a	decision	to	live	a	carbon-neutral	life	.	Those	of	you	who	are	good	at	branding	,	I	'd	love	to	get	your	advice	and	help	on	how	to	say	this	in	a	way	that	connects	with	the	most	people	.
It	is	easier	than	you	think	.	It	really	is	.
A	lot	of	us	in	here	have	made	that	decision	and	it	is	really	pretty	easy	.
It	means	:	reduce	your	carbon	dioxide	emissions	with	the	full	range	of	choices	that	you	make	,	and	then	purchase	or	acquire	offsets	for	the	remainder	that	you	have	not
completely	reduced	.	And	what	it	means	is	elaborated	at	climatecrisis.net	.	There	is	a	carbon	calculator	.	Participant	Productions	convened	,	with	my	active	involvement	,	the	leading	software	writers	in	the	world	on	this	arcane	science	of	carbon	calculation	to	construct	a	consumer-friendly	carbon	calculator	.
You	can	very	precisely	calculate	what	your	CO2	emissions	are	,	and	then	you	will	be	given	options	to	reduce	.
And	by	the	time	the	movie	comes	out	in	May	,	this	will	be	updated	to	2.0	and	we	will	have	click-through	purchases	of	offsets	.
Next	,	consider	making	your	business	carbon-neutral	.	Again	,	some	of	us	have	done	that	,	and	it	's	not	as	hard	as	you	think	.	Integrate	climate	solutions	into	all	of	your	innovations	,	whether	you	are	from	the	technology	,	or	entertainment	,	or	design	and	architecture	community	.
Invest	sustainably	.	Majora	mentioned	this	.
Listen	,	if	you	have	invested	money	with	managers	who	you	compensate	on	the	basis	of	their	annual	performance	,	do	n't	ever	again	complain	about	quarterly	report	CEO	management	.
Over	time	,	people	do	what	you	pay	them	to	do	.	And	if	they	judge	how	much	they	're	going	to	get	paid	on	your	capital	that	they	've	invested	,	based	on	the	short-term	returns	,	you	're	going	to	get	short-term	decisions	.
A	lot	more	to	be	said	about	that	.
Become	a	catalyst	of	change	.	Teach	others	;	learn	about	it	;	talk	about	it	.
The	movie	comes	out	--	the	movie	is	a	movie	version	of	the	slideshow	I	gave	two	nights	ago	,	except	it	's	a	lot	more	entertaining	.	And	it	comes	out	in	May	.
Many	of	you	here	have	the	opportunity	to	ensure	that	a	lot	of	people	see	it	.
Consider	sending	somebody	to	Nashville	.	Pick	well	.
And	I	am	personally	going	to	train	people	to	give	this	slideshow	,	re-purposed	,	with	some	of	the	personal	stories	obviously	replaced	with	a	generic	approach	,
and	--	it	's	not	just	the	slides	,	it	's	what	they	mean	.	And	it	's	how	they	link	together	.
And	so	I	'm	going	to	be	conducting	a	course	this	summer	for	a	group	of	people	that	are	nominated	by	different	folks	to	come	and	then	give	it	,	en	masse	,	in	communities	all	across	the	country	,
and	we	're	going	to	update	the	slideshow	for	all	of	them	every	single	week	to	keep	it	right	on	the	cutting	edge	.
Working	with	Larry	Lessig	,	it	will	be	,	somewhere	in	that	process	,	posted	with	tools	and	limited-use	copyrights	,	so	that	young	people	can	remix	it	and	do	it	in	their	own	way	.
Where	did	anybody	get	the	idea	that	you	ought	to	stay	arm	's	length	from	politics	?
It	does	n't	mean	that	if	you	are	a	Republican	that	I	'm	trying	to	convince	you	to	be	a	Democrat	.	We	need	Republicans	as	well	.	This	used	to	be	a	bipartisan	issue	,	and	I	know	that	in	this	group	it	really	is	.	Become	politically	active	.
Make	our	democracy	work	the	way	it	's	supposed	to	work	.
Support	the	idea	of	capping	carbon	dioxide	emissions	,	global	warming	pollution	,	and	trading	it	.	Here	's	why	:	as	long	as	the	United	States	is	out	of	the	world	system	,	it	's	not	a	closed	system	.
Once	it	becomes	a	closed	system	,	with	U.S.	participation	,	then	everybody	who	's	on	a	board	of	directors	--	how	many	people	here	serve	on	the	board	of	directors	of	a	corporation	?
Once	it	's	a	closed	system	,	you	will	have	legal	liability	if	you	do	not	urge	your	CEO	to	get	the	maximum	income	from	reducing	and	trading	the	carbon	emissions	that	can	be	avoided	.	The	market	will	work	to	solve	this	problem	if	we	can	accomplish	this	.
Help	with	the	mass	persuasion	campaign	that	will	start	this	spring	.
We	have	to	change	the	minds	of	the	American	people	.	Because	presently	the	politicians	do	not	have	permission	to	do	what	needs	to	be	done	.
And	in	our	modern	country	,	the	role	of	logic	and	reason	no	longer	includes	mediating	between	wealth	and	power	the	way	it	once	did	.
It	's	now	repetition	of	short	,	hot-button	,	30-second	,	28-second	television	ads	.
We	have	to	buy	a	lot	of	those	ads	.
Let	's	rebrand	global	warming	,	as	many	of	you	have	suggested	.
I	like	``	climate	crisis	''	instead	of	``	climate	collapse	,	''	but	again	,	those	of	you	who	are	good	at	branding	,	I	need	your	help	on	this	.
Somebody	said	the	test	we	're	facing	now	,	a	scientist	told	me	,	is	whether	the	combination	of	an	opposable	thumb	and	a	neocortex	is	a	viable	combination	.
That	's	really	true	.	I	said	the	other	night	,	and	I	'll	repeat	now	:	this	is	not	a	political	issue	.
Again	,	the	Republicans	here	,	this	should	n't	be	partisan	.
You	have	more	influence	than	some	of	us	who	are	Democrats	do	.
This	is	an	opportunity	.	Not	just	this	,	but	connected	to	the	ideas	that	are	here	,	to	bring	more	coherence	to	them	.
We	are	one	.
Thank	you	very	much	,	I	appreciate	it	.
This	is	the	ocean	as	I	used	to	know	it	.
And	I	find	that	since	I	've	been	in	the	Gulf	a	couple	of	times	,	I	really	kind	of	am	traumatized
because	whenever	I	look	at	the	ocean	now	,	no	matter	where	I	am	,	even	where	I	know	none	of	the	oil	has	gone	,	I	sort	of	see	slicks	,
and	I	'm	finding	that	I	'm	very	much	haunted	by	it	.
But	what	I	want	to	talk	to	you	about	today	is	a	lot	of	things	that	try	to	put	all	of	this	in	context	,	not	just	about	the	oil	eruption	,	but	what	it	means	and	why	it	has	happened	.
First	,	just	a	little	bit	about	me	.
I	'm	basically	just	a	guy	that	likes	to	go	fishing
ever	since	I	was	a	little	kid	,
and	because	I	did	,	I	wound	up	studying	sea	birds	to	try	to	stay	in	the	coastal	habitats	that	I	so	loved	.
And	now	I	mainly	write	books	about	how	the	ocean	is	changing	,
and	the	ocean	is	certainly	changing	very	rapidly	.
Now	we	saw	this	kind	of	graphic	earlier	on	,	that	we	really	live	on	a	hard	marble	that	has	just	a	slight	bit	of	wetness	to	it	.
It	's	like	you	dipped	a	marble	in	water	.
And	the	same	thing	with	the	atmosphere	:	If	you	took	all	the	atmosphere	and	rolled	it	up	in	a	ball	,	you	would	get	that	little	sphere	of	gas	on	the	right	.
So	we	live	on	the	most	fragile	,	little	soap	bubble	you	can	imagine	,
a	very	sacred	soap	bubble	,	but	one	that	is	very	,	very	easy	to	affect	.
And	all	the	burning	of	oil	and	coal	and	gas	,	all	the	fossil	fuels	,	have	changed	the	atmosphere	greatly	.
Carbon	dioxide	level	has	gone	up	and	up	and	up	.
We	're	warming	the	climate	.
So	the	blowout	in	the	Gulf	is	just	a	little	piece	of	a	much	larger	problem	that	we	have	with	the	energy	that	we	use	to	run	civilization	.
Beyond	warming	,	we	have	the	problem	of	the	oceans	getting	more	acidified	--	and	already	measurably	so	,	and	already	affecting	animals	.
Now	in	the	laboratory	,	if	you	take	a	clam	and	you	put	it	in	the	pH	that	is	--	not	8.1	,	which	is	the	normal	pH	of	seawater	--	but	7.5	,	it	dissolves	in	about	three	days	.
If	you	take	a	sea	urchin	larva	from	8.1	,	put	it	in	a	pH	of	7.7	--	not	a	huge	change	--	it	becomes	deformed	and	dies	.
And	already	,	commercial	oyster	larvae	are	dying	at	large	scales	in	some	places	.
Coral	reefs	are	growing	slower	in	some	places	because	of	this	problem	.
So	this	really	matters	.
Now	,	let	's	take	a	little	tour	around	the	Gulf	a	little	bit	.
One	of	the	things	that	really	impresses	me	about	the	people	in	the	Gulf	:	They	are	really	,	really	aquatic	people	.
And	they	can	handle	water	.
They	can	handle	a	hurricane	that	comes	and	goes	.	When	the	water	goes	down	,	they	know	what	to	do	.
But	when	it	's	something	other	than	water	,	and	their	water	habitat	changes	,	they	do	n't	have	many	options	.
In	fact	,	those	entire	communities	really	do	n't	have	many	options	.
They	do	n't	have	another	thing	they	can	do	.
They	ca	n't	go	and	work	in	the	local	hotel	business	because	there	is	n't	one	in	their	community	.
If	you	go	to	the	Gulf	and	you	look	around	,	you	do	see	a	lot	of	oil	.
You	see	a	lot	of	oil	on	the	ocean	.
You	see	a	lot	of	oil	on	the	shoreline	.
If	you	go	to	the	site	of	the	blowout	,	it	looks	pretty	unbelievable	.
It	looks	like	you	just	emptied	the	oil	pan	in	your	car	,	and	you	just	dumped	it	in	the	ocean	.
And	one	of	the	really	most	incredible	things	,	I	think	,	is	that	there	's	nobody	out	there	trying	to	collect	it	at	the	site	where	it	is	densest	.
Parts	of	the	ocean	there	look	just	absolutely	apocalyptic	.
You	go	in	along	the	shore	,	you	can	find	it	everywhere	.
It	's	really	messy	.
If	you	go	to	the	places	where	it	's	just	arriving	,	like	the	eastern	part	of	the	Gulf	,	in	Alabama	,	there	's	still	people	using	the	beach	while	there	are	people	cleaning	up	the	beach	.
And	they	have	a	very	strange	way	of	cleaning	up	the	beach	.	They	're	not	allowed	to	put	more	than	10	pounds	of	sand	in	a	50-gallon	plastic	bag	.
They	have	thousands	and	thousands	of	plastic	bags	.
I	do	n't	know	what	they	're	going	to	do	with	all	that	stuff	.
Meanwhile	,	there	are	still	people	trying	to	use	the	beach	.
They	do	n't	see	the	little	,	tiny	sign	that	says	:	``	Stay	out	of	the	water	.	''
Their	kids	are	in	the	water	;	they	're	getting	tar	all	over	their	clothes	and	their	sandals	.	It	's	a	mess	.
If	you	go	to	the	place	where	the	oil	has	been	a	while	,	it	's	an	even	bigger	mess	.
And	there	's	basically	nobody	there	anymore	,	a	few	people	trying	to	keep	using	it	.
You	see	people	who	are	really	shell-shocked	.
They	are	very	hardworking	people	.
All	they	know	about	life	is	they	get	up	in	the	morning	,	and	if	their	engine	starts	,	they	go	to	work	.
They	always	felt	that	they	could	rely	on	the	assurances	that	nature	brought	them	through	the	ecosystem	of	the	Gulf	.
They	're	finding	that	their	world	is	really	collapsing	.
And	so	you	can	see	,	literally	,	signs	of	their	shock	,	signs	of	their	outrage	,	signs	of	their	anger	,	and	signs	of	their	grief	.
These	are	the	things	that	you	can	see	.
There	's	a	lot	you	ca	n't	see	,	also	,	underwater	.
What	's	going	on	underwater	?
Well	,	some	people	say	there	are	oil	plumes	.
Some	people	say	there	are	not	oil	plumes	.
And	Congressman	Markey	asks	,	you	know	,	``	Is	it	going	to	take	a	submarine	ride	to	see	if	there	are	really	oil	plumes	?	''
But	I	could	n't	take	a	submarine	ride	--	especially	between	the	time	I	knew	I	was	coming	here	and	today	--	so	I	had	to	do	a	little	experiment	myself	to	see	if	there	was	oil	in	the	Gulf	of	Mexico	.
So	this	is	the	Gulf	of	Mexico	,	sparkling	place	full	of	fish	.
I	created	a	little	oil	spill	in	the	Gulf	of	Mexico	.	And	I	learned	--	in	fact	,	I	confirmed	--	the	hypothesis	that	oil	and	water	do	n't	mix	until	you	add	a	dispersant	,
and	then	they	start	mixing	.
And	you	add	a	little	energy	from	the	wind	and	the	waves	,	and	you	get	a	big	mess	,
a	big	mess	that	you	ca	n't	possibly	clean	,	you	ca	n't	touch	,	you	ca	n't	extract	and	,	I	think	most	importantly	--	this	is	what	I	think	--	you	ca	n't	see	it	.
I	think	it	's	being	hidden	on	purpose	.
Now	this	is	such	a	catastrophe	and	such	a	mess	,	that	lots	of	stuff	is	leaking	out	on	the	edges	of	the	information	stream	.
But	as	many	people	have	said	,	there	's	a	large	attempt	to	suppress	what	's	going	on	.
Personally	,	I	think	that	the	dispersants	are	a	major	strategy	to	hide	the	body	,	because	we	put	the	murderer	in	charge	of	the	crime	scene	.
But	you	can	see	it	.
You	can	see	where	the	oil	is	concentrated	at	the	surface	,
and	then	it	is	attacked	,	because	they	do	n't	want	the	evidence	,	in	my	opinion	.
Okay	.
We	heard	that	bacteria	eat	oil	?
So	do	sea	turtles	.
When	it	breaks	up	,	it	has	a	long	way	to	go	before	it	gets	down	to	bacteria	.
Turtles	eat	it	.	It	gets	in	the	gills	of	fish	.	These	guys	have	to	swim	around	through	it	.
I	heard	the	most	incredible	story	today	when	I	was	on	the	train	coming	here	.
A	writer	named	Ted	Williams	called	me	,	and	he	was	asking	me	a	couple	of	questions	about	what	I	saw	,	because	he	's	writing	an	article	for	Audubon	magazine	.
He	said	that	he	had	been	in	the	Gulf	a	little	while	ago	--	like	about	a	week	ago	--	and	a	guy	who	had	been	a	recreational	fishing	guide	took	him	out	to	show	him	what	's	going	on	.
That	guide	's	entire	calendar	year	is	canceled	bookings	.
He	has	no	bookings	left	.
Everybody	wanted	their	deposit	back	.	Everybody	is	fleeing	.
That	's	the	story	of	thousands	of	people	.
But	he	told	Ted	that	on	the	last	day	he	went	out	,	a	bottlenose	dolphin	suddenly	appeared	next	to	the	boat	,
and	it	was	splattering	oil	out	its	blowhole	.
And	he	moved	away	because	it	was	his	last	fishing	trip	,	and	he	knew	that	the	dolphins	scare	fish	.
So	he	moved	away	from	it	,	turned	around	a	few	minutes	later	,	it	was	right	next	to	the	side	of	the	boat	again	.
He	said	that	in	30	years	of	fishing	he	had	never	seen	a	dolphin	do	that	.
And	he	felt	that	--
he	felt	that	it	was	coming	to	ask	for	help	.	Sorry	.
Now	,	in	the	Exxon	Valdez	spill	,	about	30	percent	of	the	killer	whales	died	in	the	first	few	months	.
Their	numbers	have	never	recovered	.
So	the	recovery	rate	of	all	this	stuff	is	going	to	be	variable	.
It	's	going	to	take	longer	for	some	things	.	And	some	things	,	I	think	,	will	probably	come	back	a	little	faster	.
The	other	thing	about	the	Gulf	that	is	important	is	that	there	are	a	lot	of	animals	that	concentrate	in	the	Gulf	at	certain	parts	of	the	year	.
So	the	Gulf	is	a	really	important	piece	of	water	--	more	important	than	a	similar	volume	of	water	in	the	open	Atlantic	Ocean	.
These	tuna	swim	the	entire	ocean	.
They	get	in	the	Gulf	Stream	.	They	go	all	the	way	to	Europe	.
When	it	comes	time	to	spawn	,	they	come	inside	,
and	these	two	tuna	that	were	tagged	,
you	can	see	them	on	the	spawning	grounds	very	much	right	in	the	area	of	the	slick	.
They	're	probably	having	,	at	the	very	least	,	a	catastrophic	spawning	season	this	year	.
I	'm	hoping	that	maybe	the	adults	are	avoiding	that	dirty	water	.
They	do	n't	usually	like	to	go	into	water	that	is	very	cloudy	anyway	.
But	these	are	really	high-performance	athletic	animals	.
I	do	n't	know	what	this	kind	of	stuff	will	do	in	their	gills	.
I	do	n't	know	if	it	'll	affect	the	adults	.
If	it	's	not	,	it	's	certainly	affecting	their	eggs	and	larvae	,	I	would	certainly	think	.
But	if	you	look	at	that	graph	that	goes	down	and	down	and	down	,
that	's	what	we	've	done	to	this	species	through	overfishing	over	many	decades	.
So	while	the	oil	spill	,	the	leak	,	the	eruption	,	is	a	catastrophe	,	I	think	it	's	important	to	keep	in	mind	that	we	've	done	a	lot	to	affect	what	's	in	the	ocean	for	a	very	,	very	long	time	.
It	's	not	like	we	're	starting	with	something	that	's	been	okay	.
We	're	starting	with	something	that	's	had	a	lot	of	stresses	and	a	lot	of	problems	to	begin	with	.
If	you	look	around	at	the	birds	,
there	are	a	lot	of	birds	in	the	Gulf	that	concentrate	in	the	Gulf	at	certain	times	of	the	year	,	but	then	leave	.
And	they	populate	much	larger	areas	.
So	for	instance	,	most	of	the	birds	in	this	picture	are	migratory	birds	.
They	were	all	on	the	Gulf	in	May	,	while	oil	was	starting	to	come	ashore	in	certain	places	.
Down	on	the	lower	left	there	are	Ruddy	Turnstones	and	Sanderlings	.
They	breed	in	the	high	arctic	,	and	they	winter	down	in	southern	South	America	.
But	they	concentrate	in	the	Gulf	and	then	fan	out	all	across	the	arctic	.
I	saw	birds	that	breed	in	Greenland	in	the	Gulf	,
so	this	is	a	hemispheric	issue	.
The	economic	effects	go	at	least	nationally	in	many	ways	.	The	biological	effects	are	certainly	hemispheric	.
I	think	that	this	is	one	of	the	most	absolutely	mind-boggling	examples	of	total	unpreparedness	that	I	can	even	think	of	.
Even	when	the	Japanese	bombed	Pearl	Harbor	,	at	least	they	shot	back	.
And	we	just	seem	to	be	unable	to	figure	out	what	to	do	.
There	was	nothing	ready	,
and	,	you	know	,	as	we	can	see	by	what	they	're	doing	.	Mainly	what	they	're	doing	is	booms	and	dispersants	.
The	booms	are	absolutely	not	made	for	open	water	.
They	do	n't	even	attempt	to	corral	the	oil	where	it	is	most	concentrated	.
They	get	near	shore	.	Look	at	these	two	boats	.
That	one	on	the	right	is	called	Fishing	Fool	.
And	I	think	,	you	know	,	that	's	a	great	name	for	boats	that	think	that	they	're	going	to	do	anything	to	make	a	dent	in	this	by	dragging	a	boom	between	them	when	there	are	literally	hundreds	of	thousands	of	square	miles	in	the	Gulf	right	now	with	oil	at	the	surface	.
The	dispersants	make	the	oil	go	right	under	the	booms	.
The	booms	are	only	about	13	inches	in	diameter	.
So	it	's	just	absolutely	crazy	.
Here	are	shrimp	boats	employed	.
There	are	hundreds	of	shrimp	boats	employed	to	drag	booms	instead	of	nets	.
Here	they	are	working	.
You	can	see	easily	that	all	the	oily	water	just	goes	over	the	back	of	the	boom	.
All	they	're	doing	is	stirring	it	.
It	's	just	ridiculous	.
Also	,	for	all	the	shoreline	that	has	booms	--	hundreds	and	hundreds	of	miles	of	shoreline	--	all	of	the	shoreline	that	has	booms	,	there	's	adjacent	shoreline	that	does	n't	have	any	booms	.
There	is	ample	opportunity	for	oil	and	dirty	water	to	get	in	behind	them	.
And	that	lower	photo	,	that	's	a	bird	colony	that	has	been	boomed	.
Everybody	's	trying	to	protect	the	bird	colonies	there	.
Well	,	as	an	ornithologist	,	I	can	tell	you	that	birds	fly	,	and	that	--	and	that	booming	a	bird	colony	does	n't	do	it	;	it	does	n't	do	it	.
These	birds	make	a	living	by	diving	into	the	water	.
In	fact	,	really	what	I	think	they	should	do	,	if	anything	--	they	're	trying	so	hard	to	protect	those	nests	--	actually	,	if	they	destroyed	every	single	nest	some	of	the	birds	would	leave	,	and	that	would	be	better	for	them	this	year	.
As	far	as	cleaning	them	,	I	do	n't	mean	to	cast	any	aspersion	on	people	cleaning	birds	.
It	's	really	,	really	important	that	we	express	our	compassion	.
I	think	that	's	the	most	important	thing	that	people	have	,	is	compassion	.
It	's	really	important	to	get	those	images	and	to	show	it	.
But	really	,	where	are	those	birds	going	to	get	released	to	?
It	's	like	taking	somebody	out	of	a	burning	building	,	treating	them	for	smoke	inhalation	and	sending	them	back	into	the	building	,	because	the	oil	is	still	gushing	.
I	refuse	to	acknowledge	this	as	anything	like	an	accident	.
I	think	that	this	is	the	result	of	gross	negligence	.
Not	just	B.P	.
B.P	.	operated	very	sloppily	and	very	recklessly	because	they	could	.
And	they	were	allowed	to	do	so	because	of	the	absolute	failure	of	oversight	of	the	government	that	's	supposed	to	be	our	government	,	protecting	us	.
It	turns	out	that	--	you	see	this	sign	on	almost	every	commercial	vessel	in	the	United	States	--	you	know	,	if	you	spilled	a	couple	of	gallons	of	oil	,	you	would	be	in	big	trouble	.
And	you	have	to	really	wonder	who	are	the	laws	made	for	,	and	who	has	gotten	above	the	laws	.
Now	there	are	things	that	we	can	do	in	the	future	.
We	could	have	the	kinds	of	equipment	that	we	would	really	need	.
It	would	not	take	an	awful	lot	to	anticipate	that	after	making	30,000	holes	in	the	sea	floor	of	the	Gulf	of	Mexico	looking	for	oil	,	oil	might	start	coming	out	of	one	of	them	.
And	you	'd	have	some	idea	of	what	to	do	.
That	's	certainly	one	of	the	things	we	need	to	do	.
But	I	think	we	have	to	understand	where	this	leak	really	started	from	.
It	really	started	from	the	destruction	of	the	idea	that	the	government	is	there	because	it	's	our	government	,	meant	to	protect	the	larger	public	interest	.
So	I	think	that	the	oil	blowout	,	the	bank	bailout	,	the	mortgage	crisis	and	all	these	things	are	absolutely	symptoms	of	the	same	cause	.
We	still	seem	to	understand	that	at	least	we	need	the	police	to	protect	us	from	a	few	bad	people	.
And	even	though	the	police	can	be	a	little	annoying	at	times	--	giving	us	tickets	and	stuff	like	that	--	nobody	says	that	we	should	just	get	rid	of	them	.
But	in	the	entire	rest	of	government	right	now	and	for	the	last	at	least	30	years	,	there	has	been	a	culture	of	deregulation	that	is	caused	directly	by	the	people	who	we	need	to	be	protected	from	,	buying	the	government	out	from	under	us	.
Now	this	has	been	a	problem	for	a	very	,	very	long	time	.
You	can	see	that	corporations	were	illegal	at	the	founding	of	America	,
and	even	Thomas	Jefferson	complained	that	they	were	already	bidding	defiance	to	the	laws	of	our	country	.
Okay	,	people	who	say	they	're	conservative	,	if	they	really	wanted	to	be	really	conservative	and	really	patriotic	,	they	would	tell	these	corporations	to	go	to	hell	.
That	's	what	it	would	really	mean	to	be	conservative	.
So	what	we	really	need	to	do	is	regain	the	idea	that	it	's	our	government	safeguarding	our	interests
and	regain	a	sense	of	unity	and	common	cause	in	our	country	that	really	has	been	lost	.
I	think	there	are	signs	of	hope	.
We	seem	to	be	waking	up	a	little	bit	.
The	Glass-Steagall	Act	--	which	was	really	to	protect	us	from	the	kind	of	thing	that	caused	the	recession	to	happen	,	and	the	bank	meltdown	and	all	that	stuff	that	required	the	bailouts	--	that	was	put	in	effect	in	1933	,	was	systematically	destroyed	.
back	in	place	,
but	the	lobbyists	are	already	there	trying	to	weaken	the	regulations	after	the	legislation	has	just	passed	.
So	it	's	a	continued	fight	.
It	's	a	historic	moment	right	now	.
We	're	either	going	to	have	an	absolutely	unmitigated	catastrophe	of	this	oil	leak	in	the	Gulf	,	or	we	will	make	the	moment	we	need	out	of	this	,	as	many	people	have	noted	today	.
There	's	certainly	a	common	theme	about	needing	to	make	the	moment	out	of	this	.
We	've	been	through	this	before	with	other	ways	of	offshore	drilling	.
The	first	offshore	wells	were	called	whales	.
The	first	offshore	drills	were	called	harpoons	.
We	emptied	the	ocean	of	the	whales	at	that	time	.
Now	are	we	stuck	with	this	?
Ever	since	we	lived	in	caves	,	every	time	we	wanted	any	energy	,	we	lit	something	on	fire	,	and	that	is	still	what	we	're	doing	.	We	're	still	lighting	something	on	fire	every	time	we	want	energy	.
And	people	say	we	ca	n't	have	clean	energy	because	it	's	too	expensive	.
Who	says	it	's	too	expensive	?
People	who	sell	us	fossil	fuels	.
We	've	been	here	before	with	energy	,	and	people	saying	the	economy	can	not	withstand	a	switch	,	because	the	cheapest	energy	was	slavery	.
Energy	is	always	a	moral	issue	.
It	's	an	issue	that	is	moral	right	now	.
It	's	a	matter	of	right	and	wrong	.
Thank	you	very	much	.
We	live	in	in	a	remarkable	time	,	the	age	of	genomics	.
Your	genome	is	the	entire	sequence	of	your	DNA	.
Your	sequence	and	mine	are	slightly	different	.
That	's	why	we	look	different	.
I	've	got	brown	eyes	;
you	might	have	blue	or	gray	.
But	it	's	not	just	skin-deep	.
The	headlines	tell	us	that	genes	can	give	us	scary	diseases	,	maybe	even	shape	our	personality	,	or	give	us	mental	disorders	.
Our	genes	seem	to	have	awesome	power	over	our	destinies	.
And	yet	,	I	would	like	to	think	that	I	am	more	than	my	genes	.
What	do	you	guys	think	?
Are	you	more	than	your	genes	?
Yes	?
I	think	some	people	agree	with	me	.
I	think	we	should	make	a	statement	.
I	think	we	should	say	it	all	together	.
All	right	:	``	I	'm	more	than	my	genes	''	--	all	together	.
Everybody	:	I	am	more	than	my	genes	.
Sebastian	Seung	:	What	am	I	?
I	am	my	connectome	.
Now	,	since	you	guys	are	really	great	,	maybe	you	can	humor	me	and	say	this	all	together	too	.
Right	.	All	together	now	.
Everybody	:	I	am	my	connectome	.
SS	:	That	sounded	great	.
You	know	,	you	guys	are	so	great	,	you	do	n't	even	know	what	a	connectome	is	,	and	you	're	willing	to	play	along	with	me	.
I	could	just	go	home	now	.
Well	,	so	far	only	one	connectome	is	known	,	that	of	this	tiny	worm	.
Its	modest	nervous	system	consists	of	just	300	neurons	.
And	in	the	1970s	and	'80s	,	a	team	of	scientists	mapped	all	7,000	connections	between	the	neurons	.
In	this	diagram	,	every	node	is	a	neuron	,	and	every	line	is	a	connection	.
This	is	the	connectome	of	the	worm	C.	elegans	.
Your	connectome	is	far	more	complex	than	this	because	your	brain	contains	100	billion	neurons	and	10,000	times	as	many	connections	.
There	's	a	diagram	like	this	for	your	brain	,	but	there	's	no	way	it	would	fit	on	this	slide	.
Your	connectome	contains	one	million	times	more	connections	than	your	genome	has	letters	.
That	's	a	lot	of	information	.
What	's	in	that	information	?
We	do	n't	know	for	sure	,	but	there	are	theories	.
Since	the	19th	century	,	neuroscientists	have	speculated	that	maybe	your	memories	--	the	information	that	makes	you	,	you	--	maybe	your	memories	are	stored	in	the	connections	between	your	brain	's	neurons	.
And	perhaps	other	aspects	of	your	personal	identity	--	maybe	your	personality	and	your	intellect	--	maybe	they	're	also	encoded	in	the	connections	between	your	neurons	.
And	so	now	you	can	see	why	I	proposed	this	hypothesis	:	I	am	my	connectome	.
I	did	n't	ask	you	to	chant	it	because	it	's	true	;	I	just	want	you	to	remember	it	.
And	in	fact	,	we	do	n't	know	if	this	hypothesis	is	correct	,	because	we	have	never	had	technologies	powerful	enough	to	test	it	.
Finding	that	worm	connectome	took	over	a	dozen	years	of	tedious	labor	.
And	to	find	the	connectomes	of	brains	more	like	our	own	,	we	need	more	sophisticated	technologies	,	that	are	automated	,	that	will	speed	up	the	process	of	finding	connectomes	.
And	in	the	next	few	minutes	,	I	'll	tell	you	about	some	of	these	technologies	,	which	are	currently	under	development	in	my	lab	and	the	labs	of	my	collaborators	.
Now	you	've	probably	seen	pictures	of	neurons	before	.
You	can	recognize	them	instantly	by	their	fantastic	shapes	.
They	extend	long	and	delicate	branches	,	and	in	short	,	they	look	like	trees	.
But	this	is	just	a	single	neuron	.
In	order	to	find	connectomes	,	we	have	to	see	all	the	neurons	at	the	same	time	.
So	let	's	meet	Bobby	Kasthuri	,	who	works	in	the	laboratory	of	Jeff	Lichtman	at	Harvard	University	.
Bobby	is	holding	fantastically	thin	slices	of	a	mouse	brain	.
And	we	're	zooming	in	by	a	factor	of	100,000	times	to	obtain	the	resolution	,	so	that	we	can	see	the	branches	of	neurons	all	at	the	same	time	.
Except	,	you	still	may	not	really	recognize	them	,	and	that	's	because	we	have	to	work	in	three	dimensions	.
If	we	take	many	images	of	many	slices	of	the	brain	and	stack	them	up	,	we	get	a	three-dimensional	image	.
And	still	,	you	may	not	see	the	branches	.
So	we	start	at	the	top	,	and	we	color	in	the	cross-section	of	one	branch	in	red	,
and	we	do	that	for	the	next	slice	and	for	the	next	slice	.
And	we	keep	on	doing	that	,	slice	after	slice	.
If	we	continue	through	the	entire	stack	,	we	can	reconstruct	the	three-dimensional	shape	of	a	small	fragment	of	a	branch	of	a	neuron	.
And	we	can	do	that	for	another	neuron	in	green	.
And	you	can	see	that	the	green	neuron	touches	the	red	neuron	at	two	locations	,	and	these	are	what	are	called	synapses	.
Let	's	zoom	in	on	one	synapse	,
and	keep	your	eyes	on	the	interior	of	the	green	neuron	.
You	should	see	small	circles	--
these	are	called	vesicles	.
They	contain	a	molecule	know	as	a	neurotransmitter	.
And	so	when	the	green	neuron	wants	to	communicate	,	it	wants	to	send	a	message	to	the	red	neuron	,	it	spits	out	neurotransmitter	.
At	the	synapse	,	the	two	neurons	are	said	to	be	connected	like	two	friends	talking	on	the	telephone	.
So	you	see	how	to	find	a	synapse	.
How	can	we	find	an	entire	connectome	?
Well	,	we	take	this	three-dimensional	stack	of	images	and	treat	it	as	a	gigantic	three-dimensional	coloring	book	.
We	color	every	neuron	in	,	in	a	different	color	,	and	then	we	look	through	all	of	the	images	,	find	the	synapses	and	note	the	colors	of	the	two	neurons	involved	in	each	synapse	.
If	we	can	do	that	throughout	all	the	images	,	we	could	find	a	connectome	.
Now	,	at	this	point	,	you	've	learned	the	basics	of	neurons	and	synapses	.
And	so	I	think	we	're	ready	to	tackle	one	of	the	most	important	questions	in	neuroscience	:	how	are	the	brains	of	men	and	women	different	?
According	to	this	self-help	book	,	guys	brains	are	like	waffles	;	they	keep	their	lives	compartmentalized	in	boxes	.
Girls	'	brains	are	like	spaghetti	;	everything	in	their	life	is	connected	to	everything	else	.
You	guys	are	laughing	,	but	you	know	,	this	book	changed	my	life	.
But	seriously	,	what	's	wrong	with	this	?
You	already	know	enough	to	tell	me	--	what	's	wrong	with	this	statement	?
It	does	n't	matter	whether	you	're	a	guy	or	girl	,	everyone	's	brains	are	like	spaghetti	.
Or	maybe	really	,	really	fine	capellini	with	branches	.
Just	as	one	strand	of	spaghetti	contacts	many	other	strands	on	your	plate	,	one	neuron	touches	many	other	neurons	through	their	entangled	branches	.
One	neuron	can	be	connected	to	so	many	other	neurons	,	because	there	can	be	synapses	at	these	points	of	contact	.
By	now	,	you	might	have	sort	of	lost	perspective	on	how	large	this	cube	of	brain	tissue	actually	is	.
And	so	let	's	do	a	series	of	comparisons	to	show	you	.
I	assure	you	,	this	is	very	tiny	.	It	's	just	six	microns	on	a	side	.
So	,	here	's	how	it	stacks	up	against	an	entire	neuron	.
And	you	can	tell	that	,	really	,	only	the	smallest	fragments	of	branches	are	contained	inside	this	cube	.
And	a	neuron	,	well	,	that	's	smaller	than	brain	.
And	that	's	just	a	mouse	brain	--
it	's	a	lot	smaller	than	a	human	brain	.
So	when	show	my	friends	this	,	sometimes	they	've	told	me	,	``	You	know	,	Sebastian	,	you	should	just	give	up	.
Neuroscience	is	hopeless	.	''
Because	if	you	look	at	a	brain	with	your	naked	eye	,	you	do	n't	really	see	how	complex	it	is	,	but	when	you	use	a	microscope	,	finally	the	hidden	complexity	is	revealed	.
In	the	17th	century	,	the	mathematician	and	philosopher	,	Blaise	Pascal	,	wrote	of	his	dread	of	the	infinite	,	his	feeling	of	insignificance	at	contemplating	the	vast	reaches	of	outer	space	.
And	,	as	a	scientist	,	I	'm	not	supposed	to	talk	about	my	feelings	--
too	much	information	,	professor	.
But	may	I	?
I	feel	curiosity	,	and	I	feel	wonder	,	but	at	times	I	have	also	felt	despair	.
Why	did	I	choose	to	study	this	organ	that	is	so	awesome	in	its	complexity	that	it	might	well	be	infinite	?
It	's	absurd	.
How	could	we	even	dare	to	think	that	we	might	ever	understand	this	?
And	yet	,	I	persist	in	this	quixotic	endeavor	.
And	indeed	,	these	days	I	harbor	new	hopes	.
Someday	,	a	fleet	of	microscopes	will	capture	every	neuron	and	every	synapse	in	a	vast	database	of	images	.
And	some	day	,	artificially	intelligent	supercomputers	will	analyze	the	images	without	human	assistance	to	summarize	them	in	a	connectome	.
I	do	not	know	,	but	I	hope	that	I	will	live	to	see	that	day	,
because	finding	an	entire	human	connectome	is	one	of	the	greatest	technological	challenges	of	all	time	.
It	will	take	the	work	of	generations	to	succeed	.
At	the	present	time	,	my	collaborators	and	I	,	what	we	're	aiming	for	is	much	more	modest	--	just	to	find	partial	connectomes	of	tiny	chunks	of	mouse	and	human	brain	.
But	even	that	will	be	enough	for	the	first	tests	of	this	hypothesis	that	I	am	my	connectome	.
For	now	,	let	me	try	to	convince	you	of	the	plausibility	of	this	hypothesis	,	that	it	's	actually	worth	taking	seriously	.
As	you	grow	during	childhood	and	age	during	adulthood	,	your	personal	identity	changes	slowly	.
Likewise	,	every	connectome	changes	over	time	.
What	kinds	of	changes	happen	?
Well	,	neurons	,	like	trees	,	can	grow	new	branches	,	and	they	can	lose	old	ones	.
Synapses	can	be	created	,	and	they	can	be	eliminated	.
And	synapses	can	grow	larger	,	and	they	can	grow	smaller	.
Second	question	:	what	causes	these	changes	?
Well	,	it	's	true	.
To	some	extent	,	they	are	programmed	by	your	genes	.
But	that	's	not	the	whole	story	,	because	there	are	signals	,	electrical	signals	,	that	travel	along	the	branches	of	neurons	and	chemical	signals	that	jump	across	from	branch	to	branch	.
These	signals	are	called	neural	activity	.
And	there	's	a	lot	of	evidence	that	neural	activity	is	encoding	our	thoughts	,	feelings	and	perceptions	,	our	mental	experiences	.
And	there	's	a	lot	of	evidence	that	neural	activity	can	cause	your	connections	to	change	.
And	if	you	put	those	two	facts	together	,	it	means	that	your	experiences	can	change	your	connectome	.
And	that	's	why	every	connectome	is	unique	,	even	those	of	genetically	identical	twins	.
The	connectome	is	where	nature	meets	nurture	.
And	it	might	true	that	just	the	mere	act	of	thinking	can	change	your	connectome	--	an	idea	that	you	may	find	empowering	.
What	's	in	this	picture	?
A	cool	and	refreshing	stream	of	water	,	you	say	.
What	else	is	in	this	picture	?
Do	not	forget	that	groove	in	the	Earth	called	the	stream	bed	.
Without	it	,	the	water	would	not	know	in	which	direction	to	flow	.
And	with	the	stream	,	I	would	like	to	propose	a	metaphor	for	the	relationship	between	neural	activity	and	connectivity	.
Neural	activity	is	constantly	changing	.
It	's	like	the	water	of	the	stream	;	it	never	sits	still	.
The	connections	of	the	brain	's	neural	network	determines	the	pathways	along	which	neural	activity	flows	.
And	so	the	connectome	is	like	bed	of	the	stream	;
but	the	metaphor	is	richer	than	that	,
because	it	's	true	that	the	stream	bed	guides	the	flow	of	the	water	,	but	over	long	timescales	,	the	water	also	reshapes	the	bed	of	the	stream	.
And	as	I	told	you	just	now	,	neural	activity	can	change	the	connectome	.
And	if	you	'll	allow	me	to	ascend	to	metaphorical	heights	,	I	will	remind	you	that	neural	activity	is	the	physical	basis	--	or	so	neuroscientists	think	--	of	thoughts	,	feelings	and	perceptions	.
And	so	we	might	even	speak	of	the	stream	of	consciousness	.
Neural	activity	is	its	water	,	and	the	connectome	is	its	bed	.
So	let	's	return	from	the	heights	of	metaphor	and	return	to	science	.
Suppose	our	technologies	for	finding	connectomes	actually	work	.
How	will	we	go	about	testing	the	hypothesis	``	I	am	my	connectome	?	''
Well	,	I	propose	a	direct	test	.
Let	us	attempt	to	read	out	memories	from	connectomes	.
Consider	the	memory	of	long	temporal	sequences	of	movements	,	like	a	pianist	playing	a	Beethoven	sonata	.
According	to	a	theory	that	dates	back	to	the	19th	century	,	such	memories	are	stored	as	chains	of	synaptic	connections	inside	your	brain	.
Because	,	if	the	first	neurons	in	the	chain	are	activated	,	through	their	synapses	they	send	messages	to	the	second	neurons	,	which	are	activated	,	and	so	on	down	the	line	,	like	a	chain	of	falling	dominoes	.
And	this	sequence	of	neural	activation	is	hypothesized	to	be	the	neural	basis	of	those	sequence	of	movements	.
So	one	way	of	trying	to	test	the	theory	is	to	look	for	such	chains	inside	connectomes	.
But	it	wo	n't	be	easy	,	because	they	're	not	going	to	look	like	this	.
They	're	going	to	be	scrambled	up	.
So	we	'll	have	to	use	our	computers	to	try	to	unscramble	the	chain	.
And	if	we	can	do	that	,	the	sequence	of	the	neurons	we	recover	from	that	unscrambling	will	be	a	prediction	of	the	pattern	of	neural	activity	that	is	replayed	in	the	brain	during	memory	recall	.
And	if	that	were	successful	,	that	would	be	the	first	example	of	reading	a	memory	from	a	connectome	.
What	a	mess	--
have	you	ever	tried	to	wire	up	a	system	as	complex	as	this	?
I	hope	not	.
But	if	you	have	,	you	know	it	's	very	easy	to	make	a	mistake	.
The	branches	of	neurons	are	like	the	wires	of	the	brain	.
Can	anyone	guess	:	what	's	the	total	length	of	wires	in	your	brain	?
I	'll	give	you	a	hint	.	It	's	a	big	number	.
I	estimate	,	millions	of	miles	,
all	packed	in	your	skull	.
And	if	you	appreciate	that	number	,	you	can	easily	see	there	is	huge	potential	for	mis-wiring	of	the	brain	.
And	indeed	,	the	popular	press	loves	headlines	like	,	``	Anorexic	brains	are	wired	differently	,	''	or	``	Autistic	brains	are	wired	differently	.	''
These	are	plausible	claims	,	but	in	truth	,	we	ca	n't	see	the	brain	's	wiring	clearly	enough	to	tell	if	these	are	really	true	.
And	so	the	technologies	for	seeing	connectomes	will	allow	us	to	finally	read	mis-wiring	of	the	brain	,	to	see	mental	disorders	in	connectomes	.
Sometimes	the	best	way	to	test	a	hypothesis	is	to	consider	its	most	extreme	implication	.
Philosophers	know	this	game	very	well	.
If	you	believe	that	I	am	my	connectome	,	I	think	you	must	also	accept	the	idea	that	death	is	the	destruction	of	your	connectome	.
I	mention	this	because	there	are	prophets	today	who	claim	that	technology	will	fundamentally	alter	the	human	condition	and	perhaps	even	transform	the	human	species	.
One	of	their	most	cherished	dreams	is	to	cheat	death	by	that	practice	known	as	cryonics	.
If	you	pay	100,000	dollars	,	you	can	arrange	to	have	your	body	frozen	after	death	and	stored	in	liquid	nitrogen	in	one	of	these	tanks	in	an	Arizona	warehouse	,	awaiting	a	future	civilization	that	is	advanced	to	resurrect	you	.
Should	we	ridicule	the	modern	seekers	of	immortality	,	calling	them	fools	?
Or	will	they	someday	chuckle	over	our	graves	?
I	do	n't	know	--
I	prefer	to	test	their	beliefs	,	scientifically	.
I	propose	that	we	attempt	to	find	a	connectome	of	a	frozen	brain	.
We	know	that	damage	to	the	brain	occurs	after	death	and	during	freezing	.
The	question	is	:	has	that	damage	erased	the	connectome	?
If	it	has	,	there	is	no	way	that	any	future	civilization	will	be	able	to	recover	the	memories	of	these	frozen	brains	.
Resurrection	might	succeed	for	the	body	,	but	not	for	the	mind	.
On	the	other	hand	,	if	the	connectome	is	still	intact	,	we	can	not	ridicule	the	claims	of	cryonics	so	easily	.
I	've	described	a	quest	that	begins	in	the	world	of	the	very	small	,	and	propels	us	to	the	world	of	the	far	future	.
Connectomes	will	mark	a	turning	point	in	human	history	.
As	we	evolved	from	our	ape-like	ancestors	on	the	African	savanna	,	what	distinguished	us	was	our	larger	brains	.
We	have	used	our	brains	to	fashion	ever	more	amazing	technologies	.
Eventually	,	these	technologies	will	become	so	powerful	that	we	will	use	them	to	know	ourselves	by	deconstructing	and	reconstructing	our	own	brains	.
I	believe	that	this	voyage	of	self-discovery	is	not	just	for	scientists	,	but	for	all	of	us	.
And	I	'm	grateful	for	the	opportunity	to	share	this	voyage	with	you	today	.
Thank	you	.
Zach	Kaplan	:	Keith	and	I	lead	a	research	team	.
We	investigate	materials	and	technologies	that	have	unexpected	properties	.	Over	the	last	three	years	,	we	found	over	200	of	these	things	,	and	so	we	looked	back	into	our	library	and	selected	six	we	thought	would	be	most	surprising	for	TED	.
Of	these	six	,	the	first	one	that	we	're	going	to	talk	about	is	in	the	black	envelope	you	're	holding	.
It	comes	from	a	company	in	Japan	called	GelTech	.	Now	go	ahead	and	open	it	up	.
Keith	Schacht	:	Now	be	sure	and	take	the	two	pieces	apart	.
What	's	unexpected	about	this	is	that	it	's	soft	,	but	it	's	also	a	strong	magnet	.
Zach	and	I	have	always	been	fascinated	observing	unexpected	things	like	this	.
We	spent	a	long	time	thinking	about	why	this	is	,	and	it	's	just	recently	that	we	realized	:	it	's	when	we	see	something	unexpected	,	it	changes	our	understanding	of	the	way	things	work	.
As	you	're	seeing	this	gel	magnet	for	the	first	time	,	if	you	assume	that	all	magnets	had	to	be	hard	,	then	seeing	this	surprised	you	and	it	changed	your	understanding	of	the	way	magnets	could	work	.
ZK	:	Now	,	it	's	important	to	understand	what	the	unexpected	properties	are	.
But	to	really	think	about	the	implications	of	what	this	makes	possible	,	we	found	that	it	helps	to	think	about	how	it	could	be	applied	in	the	world	.
So	,	a	first	idea	is	to	use	it	on	cabinet	doors	.
If	you	line	the	sides	of	the	cabinets	using	the	gel	material	--	if	a	cabinet	slams	shut	it	would	n't	make	a	loud	noise	,	and	in	addition	the	magnets	would	draw	the	cabinets	closed	.
Imagine	taking	the	same	material	,	but	putting	it	on	the	bottom	of	a	sneaker	.
You	know	,	this	way	you	could	go	to	the	container	store	and	buy	one	of	those	metal	sheets	that	they	hang	on	the	back	of	your	door	,	in	your	closet	,	and	you	could	literally	stick	your	shoes	up	instead	of	using	a	shelf	.
For	me	,	I	really	love	this	idea	.
If	you	come	to	my	apartment	and	see	my	closet	,	I	'm	sure	you	'd	figure	out	why	:	it	's	a	mess	.
KS	:	Seeing	the	unexpected	properties	and	then	seeing	a	couple	of	applications	--	it	helps	you	see	why	this	is	significant	,	what	the	potential	is	.
But	we	've	found	that	the	way	we	present	our	ideas	it	makes	a	big	difference	.
ZK	:	It	was	like	six	months	ago	that	Keith	and	I	were	out	in	L.A.	,	and	we	were	at	Starbucks	having	coffee	with	Roman	Coppola	.
He	works	on	mostly	music	videos	and	commercials	with	his	company	,	The	Directors	Bureau	.	As	we	were	talking	,	Roman	told	us	that	he	's	kind	of	an	inventor	on	the	side	.
And	we	were	showing	him	the	same	gel	magnet	that	you	're	holding	in	your	hand	--	and	you	know	,	we	shared	the	same	ideas	.	And	you	could	see	it	in	his	face	:
Roman	starts	to	get	really	excited	and	he	whips	out	this	manila	folder	;	he	opens	it	up	and	Keith	and	I	look	in	,	and	he	starts	showing	us	concepts	that	he	's	been	working	on	.
These	things	just	get	him	really	excited	.	And	so	we	're	looking	at	these	concepts	,	and	we	were	just	like	,	whoa	,	this	guy	's	good	.
Because	the	way	that	he	presented	the	concept	--	his	approach	was	totally	different	than	ours	.	He	sold	it	to	you	as	if	it	was	for	sale	right	now	.
When	we	were	going	in	the	car	back	to	the	airport	,	we	were	thinking	:	why	was	this	so	powerful	?
And	as	we	thought	about	it	more	,	we	realized	that	it	let	you	fill	in	all	the	details	about	the	experience	,	just	as	if	you	saw	it	on	TV	.	So	,	for	TED	we	decided	to	take	our	favorite	idea	for	the	gel	magnet	and	work	with	Roman	and	his	team	at	the	Directors	Bureau	to	create	a	commercial	for	a	product	from	the	future	.
Narrator	:	Do	you	have	a	need	for	speed	?
Inventables	Water	Adventures	dares	you	to	launch	yourself	on	a	magnetically-levitating	board	down	a	waterslide	so	fast	,	so	tall	,	that	when	you	hit	the	bottom	,	it	uses	brakes	to	stop	.
Aqua	Rocket	:	coming	this	summer	.
KS	:	Now	,	we	showed	the	concept	to	a	few	people	before	this	,	and	they	asked	us	,	when	's	it	coming	out	?
So	I	just	wanted	to	let	you	know	,	it	's	not	actually	coming	out	,	just	the	concept	is	.
ZK	:	So	now	,	when	we	dream	up	these	concepts	,	it	's	important	for	us	to	make	sure	that	they	work	from	a	technical	standpoint	.
So	I	just	want	to	quickly	explain	how	this	would	work	.
This	is	the	magnetically-levitating	board	that	they	mentioned	in	the	commercial	.
The	gel	that	you	're	holding	would	be	lining	the	bottom	of	the	board	.
Now	this	is	important	for	two	reasons	.
One	:	the	soft	properties	of	the	magnet	that	make	it	so	that	,	if	it	were	to	hit	the	rider	in	the	head	,	it	would	n't	injure	him	.
In	addition	,	you	can	see	from	the	diagram	on	the	right	,	the	underpart	of	the	slide	would	be	an	electromagnet	.
So	this	would	actually	repel	the	rider	a	little	bit	as	you	're	going	down	.
The	force	of	the	water	rushing	down	,	in	addition	to	that	repulsion	force	,	would	make	this	slide	go	faster	than	any	slide	on	the	market	.
It	's	because	of	this	that	you	need	the	magnetic	braking	system	.
When	you	get	to	the	very	bottom	of	the	slide	--	--	the	rider	passes	through	an	aluminum	tube	.
And	I	'm	going	to	kick	it	to	Keith	to	explain	why	that	's	important	from	a	technical	standpoint	.
KS	:	So	I	'm	sure	all	you	engineers	know	that	even	though	aluminum	is	a	metal	,	it	's	not	a	magnetic	material	.	But	something	unexpected	happens	when	you	drop	a	magnet	down	an	aluminum	tube	.
So	we	set	up	a	quick	experiment	here	to	show	that	to	you	.	Now	,	you	see	the	magnet	fell	really	slowly	.
Now	,	I	'm	not	going	to	get	into	the	physics	of	it	,	but	all	you	need	to	know	is	that	the	faster	the	magnet	's	falling	,	the	greater	the	stopping	force	.
ZK	:	Now	,	our	next	technology	is	actually	a	10-foot	pole	,
and	I	have	it	right	here	in	my	pocket	.
There	're	a	few	different	versions	of	it	.
KS	:	Some	of	them	automatically	unroll	like	this	one	.
They	can	be	made	to	automatically	roll	up	,	or	they	can	be	made	stable	,	like	Zach	's	,	to	hold	any	position	in	between	.
ZK	:	As	we	were	talking	to	the	vendor	--	to	try	to	learn	about	how	you	could	apply	these	,	or	how	they	're	being	applied	currently	--	he	was	telling	us	that	,	in	the	military	they	use	this	one	so	soldiers	can	keep	it	on	their	chests	--	very	concealed	--	and	then	,	when	they	're	out	on	the	field	,	erect	it	as	an	antenna	to	clearly	send	signals	back	to	the	base	.
In	our	brainstorms	,	we	came	up	with	the	idea	you	could	use	it	for	a	soccer	goal	:	so	at	the	end	of	the	game	,	you	just	roll	up	the	goal	and	put	it	in	your	gym	bag	.
KS	:	Now	,	the	interesting	thing	about	this	is	,	you	do	n't	have	to	be	an	engineer	to	appreciate	why	a	10-foot	pole	that	can	fit	in	your	pocket	is	so	interesting	.
So	we	decided	to	go	out	onto	the	streets	of	Chicago	and	ask	a	few	people	on	the	streets	what	they	thought	you	could	do	with	this	.
Man	:	I	clean	my	ceiling	fans	with	that	and	I	get	the	spider	webs	off	my	house	--	I	do	it	that	way	.
Woman	:	I	'd	make	my	very	own	walking	stick	.
Woman	:	I	would	create	a	ladder	to	use	to	get	up	on	top	of	the	tree	.
Woman	:	An	olive	server	.
Man	:	Some	type	of	extension	pole	--	like	what	the	painters	use	.
Woman	:	I	would	make	a	spear	that	,	when	you	went	deep	sea	diving	,	you	could	catch	the	fish	really	fast	,	and	then	roll	it	back	up	,	and	you	could	swim	easier	...	Yeah	.
ZK	:	Now	,	for	our	next	technology	we	're	going	to	do	a	little	demonstration	,	and	so	we	need	a	volunteer	from	the	audience	.
You	sir	,	come	on	up	.
Come	on	up	.	Tell	everybody	your	name	.
Steve	Jurvetson	:	Steve	.
ZK	:	It	's	Steve	.	All	right	Steve	,	now	,	follow	me	.
We	need	you	to	stand	right	in	front	of	the	TED	sign	.
Right	there	.	That	's	great	.
And	hold	onto	this	.	Good	luck	to	you	.
KS	:	No	,	not	yet	.
ZK	:	I	'd	just	like	to	let	you	all	know	that	this	presentation	has	been	brought	to	you	by	Target	.
KS	:	Little	bit	--	that	's	perfect	,	just	perfect	.
Now	,	Zach	,	we	're	going	to	demonstrate	a	water	gun	fight	from	the	future	.
So	here	,	come	on	up	to	the	front	.	All	right	,	so	now	if	you	'll	see	here	--	no	,	no	,	it	's	OK	.
So	,	describe	to	the	audience	the	temperature	of	your	shirt	.	Go	ahead	.
SJ	:	It	's	cold	.
KS	:	Now	the	reason	it	's	cold	is	that	's	it	's	not	actually	water	loaded	into	these	squirt	guns	--	it	's	a	dry	liquid	developed	by	3M	.
It	's	perfectly	clear	,	it	's	odorless	,	it	's	colorless	.
It	's	so	safe	you	could	drink	this	stuff	.
And	the	reason	it	feels	cold	is	because	it	evaporates	25	times	faster	than	water	.
All	right	,	well	thanks	for	coming	up	.
ZK	:	Wait	,	wait	,	Steven	--	before	you	go	we	filled	this	with	the	dry	liquid	so	during	the	break	you	can	shoot	your	friends	.
SJ	:	Excellent	,	thank	you	.
KS	:	Thanks	for	coming	up	.	Let	's	give	him	a	big	round	of	applause	.
So	what	's	the	significance	of	this	dry	liquid	?
Early	versions	of	the	fluid	were	actually	used	on	a	Cray	Supercomputer	.
Now	,	the	unexpected	thing	about	this	is	that	Zach	could	stand	up	on	stage	and	drench	a	perfectly	innocent	member	of	the	audience	without	any	concern	that	we	'd	damage	the	electronics	,	that	we	'd	get	him	wet	,	that	we	'd	hurt	the	books	or	the	computers	.	It	works	because	it	's	non-conductive	.
So	you	can	see	here	,	you	can	immerse	a	whole	circuit	board	in	this	and	it	would	n't	cause	any	damage	.
You	can	circulate	it	to	draw	the	heat	away	.
But	today	it	's	most	widely	used	in	office	buildings	--	in	the	sprinkler	system	--	as	a	fire-suppression	fluid	.
Again	,	it	's	perfectly	safe	for	people	.	It	puts	out	the	fires	,	does	n't	hurt	anything	.
But	our	favorite	idea	for	this	was	using	it	in	a	basketball	game	.	So	during	halftime	,	it	could	rain	down	on	the	players	,	cool	everyone	down	,	and	in	a	matter	of	minutes	it	would	dry	.	Would	n't	hurt	the	court	.
ZK	:	Our	next	technology	comes	to	us	from	a	company	in	Japan	called	Sekisui	Chemical	.	One	of	their	R	&	amp	;	D	engineers	was	working	on	a	way	to	make	plastic	stiffer	.
While	he	was	doing	this	,	he	noticed	an	unexpected	thing	.
We	have	a	video	to	show	you	.
KS	:	So	you	see	there	,	it	did	n't	bounce	back	.	Now	,	this	was	an	unintended	side	effect	of	some	experiments	they	were	doing	.
It	's	technically	called	,	``	shape-retaining	property	.	''	Now	,	think	about	your	interactions	with	aluminum	foil	.
Shape-retaining	is	common	in	metal	:	you	bend	a	piece	of	aluminum	foil	,	and	it	holds	its	place	.	Contrast	that	with	a	plastic	garbage	can	--	and	you	can	push	in	the	sides	and	it	always	bounces	back	.
ZK	:	For	example	,	you	could	make	a	watch	that	wraps	around	your	wrist	,	but	does	n't	use	a	buckle	.
Taking	it	a	little	further	,	if	you	wove	those	strips	together	--	kind	of	like	a	little	basket	--	you	could	make	a	shape-retaining	sheet	,	and	then	you	could	embed	it	in	a	cloth	:	so	you	could	make	a	picnic	sheet	that	wraps	around	the	table	,	so	that	way	on	a	windy	day	it	would	n't	blow	away	.
For	our	next	technology	,	it	's	hard	to	observe	the	unexpected	property	by	itself	,	because	it	's	an	ink	.
So	,	we	've	prepared	a	video	to	show	it	applied	to	paper	.
KS	:	As	this	paper	is	bending	,	the	resistance	of	the	ink	changes	.
So	with	simple	electronics	,	you	can	detect	how	much	the	page	is	being	bent	.
Now	,	to	think	about	the	potential	for	this	,	think	of	all	the	places	ink	is	supplied	:	on	business	cards	,	on	the	back	of	cereal	boxes	,	board	games	.	Any	place	you	use	ink	,	you	could	change	the	way	you	interact	with	it	.
ZK	:	So	my	favorite	idea	for	this	is	to	apply	the	ink	to	a	book	.
This	could	totally	change	the	way	that	you	interface	with	paper	.
You	see	the	dark	line	on	the	side	and	the	top	.	As	you	turn	the	pages	of	the	book	,	the	book	can	actually	detect	what	page	you	're	on	,	based	on	the	curvature	of	the	pages	.
In	addition	,	if	you	were	to	fold	in	one	of	the	corners	,	then	you	could	program	the	book	to	actually	email	you	the	text	on	the	page	for	your	notes	.
KS	:	For	our	last	technology	,	we	worked	again	with	Roman	and	his	team	at	the	Directors	Bureau	to	develop	a	commercial	from	the	future	to	explain	how	it	works	.
Old	Milk	Carton	:	Oh	yeah	,	it	smells	good	.
Who	are	you	?
New	Milk	Carton	:	I	'm	New	Milk	.
OMC	:	I	used	to	smell	like	you	.
Narrator	:	Fresh	Watch	,	from	Inventables	Dairy	Farms	.
Packaging	that	changes	color	when	your	milk	's	gone	off	.
Do	n't	let	milk	spoil	your	morning	.
ZK	:	Now	,	this	technology	was	developed	by	these	two	guys	:	Professor	Ken	Suslick	and	Neil	Rakow	,	of	the	University	of	Illinois	.
KS	:	Now	the	way	it	works	:	there	's	a	matrix	of	color	dyes	.
And	these	dyes	change	color	in	response	to	odors	.
So	the	smell	of	vanilla	,	that	might	change	the	four	on	the	left	to	brown	and	the	one	on	the	right	to	yellow	.	This	matrix	can	produce	thousands	of	different	color	combinations	to	represent	thousands	of	different	smells	.
But	like	in	the	milk	commercial	,	if	you	know	what	odor	you	want	to	detect	,	then	they	can	formulate	a	specific	dye	to	detect	just	that	odor	.
ZK	:	Right	.	It	was	that	that	started	a	conversation	with	Professor	Suslick	and	myself	,	and	he	was	explaining	to	me	the	things	that	this	is	making	possible	,
beyond	just	detecting	spoiled	food	.	It	's	really	where	the	significance	of	it	lies	.
His	company	actually	did	a	survey	of	firemen	all	across	the	country	to	try	to	learn	,	how	are	they	currently	testing	the	air	when	they	respond	to	an	emergency	scene	?
And	he	kind	of	comically	explained	that	time	after	time	,	what	the	firemen	would	say	is	:	they	would	rush	to	the	scene	of	the	crime	;	they	would	look	around	;
if	there	were	no	dead	policemen	,	it	was	OK	to	go	.
I	mean	,	this	is	a	true	story	.	They	're	using	policemen	as	canaries	.
But	more	seriously	,	they	determined	that	you	could	develop	a	device	that	can	smell	better	than	the	humans	,	and	say	if	it	's	safe	for	the	firemen	.
In	addition	,	he	's	spun	off	a	company	from	the	University	called	ChemSensing	,	where	they	're	working	on	medical	equipment	.	So	,	a	patient	can	come	in	and	actually	blow	into	their	device	.
By	detecting	the	odor	of	particular	bacteria	,	or	viruses	,	or	even	lung	cancer	,	the	dots	will	change	and	they	can	use	software	to	analyze	the	results	.
This	can	radically	improve	the	way	that	doctors	diagnose	patients	.
Currently	,	they	're	using	a	method	of	trial	and	error	,	but	this	could	tell	you	precisely	what	disease	you	have	.
KS	:	So	that	was	the	six	we	had	for	you	today	,	but	I	hope	you	're	starting	to	see	why	we	find	these	things	so	fascinating	.
Because	every	one	of	these	six	changed	our	understanding	of	what	was	possible	in	the	world	.	Prior	to	seeing	this	,	we	would	have	assumed	:	a	10-foot	pole	could	n't	fit	in	your	pocket	;
something	as	inexpensive	as	ink	could	n't	sense	the	way	paper	is	being	bent	;
every	one	of	these	things	--	and	we	're	constantly	trying	to	find	more	.
ZK	:	This	is	something	that	Keith	and	I	really	enjoy	doing	.
I	'm	sure	it	's	obvious	to	you	now	,	but	it	was	actually	yesterday	that	I	was	reminded	of	why	.	I	was	having	a	conversation	with	Steve	Jurvetson	,	over	downstairs	by	the	escalators	,	and	he	was	telling	me	that	when	Chris	sent	out	that	little	box	,	one	of	the	items	in	it	was	the	hydrophobic	sand	--	the	sand	that	does	n't	get	wet	.	He	said	that	he	was	playing	with	it	with	his	son	.
And	you	know	,	his	son	was	mesmerized	,	because	he	would	dunk	it	in	the	water	,	he	would	take	it	out	and	it	was	bone	dry	.	A	few	weeks	later	,	he	said	that	his	son	was	playing	with	a	lock	of	his	mother	's	hair	,	and	he	noticed	that	there	were	some	drops	of	water	on	the	hair	.
And	he	took	the	thing	and	he	looked	up	to	Steve	and	he	said	,	``	Look	,	hydrophobic	string	.	''
I	mean	,	after	hearing	that	story	--	that	really	summed	it	up	for	me	.
Thank	you	very	much	.
KS	:	Thank	you	.
I	went	to	Spain	a	few	months	ago	and	I	had	the	best	foie	gras	of	my	life	.
The	best	culinary	experience	of	my	life	.
Because	what	I	saw	,	I	'm	convinced	,	is	the	future	of	cooking	.
Ridiculous	,	right	?
Foie	gras	and	the	future	of	cooking	.
There	's	not	a	food	today	that	's	more	maligned	than	foie	gras	,	right	?
I	mean	,	it	's	crucified	.
It	was	outlawed	in	Chicago	for	a	while	.
It	's	pending	here	in	California	,	and	just	recently	in	New	York	.
It	's	like	if	you	're	a	chef	and	you	put	it	on	your	menu	,	you	risk	being	attacked	.
Really	,	it	happened	here	in	San	Francisco	to	a	famous	chef	.
I	'm	not	saying	that	there	's	not	a	rationale	for	being	opposed	to	foie	gras	.
The	reasons	usually	just	boil	down	to	the	gavage	,	which	is	the	force	feeding	.
Basically	you	take	a	goose	or	a	duck	and	you	force	feed	a	ton	of	grain	down	its	throat	.
More	grain	in	a	couple	of	weeks	than	it	would	ever	get	in	a	lifetime	.
Its	liver	expands	by	eight	times	.
Suffice	to	say	it	's	like	--	it	's	not	the	prettiest	picture	of	sustainable	farming	.
The	problem	for	us	chefs	is	that	it	's	so	freakin	'	delicious	.
I	mean	,	I	love	the	stuff	.
It	is	fatty	,	it	's	sweet	,	it	's	silky	,	it	's	unctuous	.
It	makes	everything	else	you	put	it	with	taste	incredible	.
Can	we	produce	a	menu	that	's	delicious	without	foie	gras	?
Yes	,	sure	.
You	can	also	bike	the	Tour	de	France	without	steroids	,	right	?
Not	a	lot	of	people	are	doing	it	.
And	for	good	reason	.
So	several	months	ago	,	a	friend	of	mine	sent	me	this	link	to	this	guy	,	Eduardo	Sousa	.
Eduardo	is	doing	what	he	calls	natural	foie	gras	.
Natural	foie	gras	.
What	's	natural	about	foie	gras	?
To	take	advantage	of	when	the	temperature	drops	in	the	fall	,	geese	and	ducks	gorge	on	food	to	prepare	for	the	harsh	realities	of	winter	.
And	the	rest	of	the	year	they	're	free	to	roam	around	Eduardo	's	land	and	eat	what	they	want	.
So	no	gavage	,	no	force	feeding	,	no	factory-like	conditions	,	no	cruelty	.
And	it	's	shockingly	not	a	new	idea	.
His	great-granddad	started	--	Patería	de	Sousa	--	in	1812	.
And	they	've	been	doing	it	quietly	ever	since	.
That	is	until	last	year	,	when	Eduardo	won	the	Coup	de	Coeur	,	the	coveted	French	gastronomic	prize	.
It	's	like	the	Olympics	of	food	products	.
He	placed	first	for	his	foie	gras	.
Big	,	big	problem	.
As	he	said	to	me	,	that	really	pissed	the	French	off	.
He	said	it	sort	of	gleefully	.
It	was	all	over	the	papers	.
I	read	about	it	.	It	was	in	Le	Monde	.
``	Spanish	chef	accused	...	``	--	and	the	French	accused	him	.
``	Spanish	chef	accused	of	cheating	.	''
They	accused	him	of	paying	off	the	judges	.
They	implicated	actually	,	the	Spanish	government	,	amazingly	.
Huh	,	amazing	.
A	huge	scandal	for	a	few	weeks	.
Could	n't	find	a	shred	of	evidence	.
Now	,	look	at	the	guy	.
He	does	n't	look	like	a	guy	who	's	paying	off	French	judges	for	his	foie	gras	.
So	that	died	down	,	and	very	soon	afterward	,	new	controversy	.
He	should	n't	win	because	it	's	not	foie	gras	.
It	's	not	foie	gras	because	it	's	not	gavage	.
There	's	no	force	feeding	.
So	by	definition	,	he	's	lying	and	should	be	disqualified	.
As	funny	as	it	sounds	,	articulating	it	now	and	reading	about	it	--	actually	,	if	we	had	talked	about	it	before	this	controversy	,	I	would	have	said	,	``	That	's	kind	of	true	.	''
You	know	,	foie	gras	by	definition	,	force	feeding	,	it	's	gavage	,	and	that	's	what	you	get	when	you	want	foie	gras	.
That	is	,	until	I	went	to	Eduardo	's	farm	in	Extremadura	,	50	miles	north	of	Seville	,	right	on	the	Portugal	border	.
I	saw	first-hand	a	system	that	is	incredibly	complex	and	then	at	the	same	time	,	like	everything	beautiful	in	nature	,	is	utterly	simple	.
And	he	said	to	me	,	really	from	the	first	moment	,	my	life	's	work	is	to	give	the	geese	what	they	want	.
He	repeated	that	about	50	times	in	the	two	days	I	was	with	him	.
I	'm	just	here	to	give	the	geese	what	they	want	.
Actually	,	when	I	showed	up	he	was	lying	down	with	the	geese	with	his	cell	phone
taking	pictures	of	them
like	his	children	in	the	grass	.
Amazing	.
He	's	really	just	in	love	with	--	he	's	at	one	with	--	he	's	the	goose	whisperer	.
And	when	I	was	speaking	to	him	,	you	know	,	I	thought	,	like	I	'm	speaking	to	you	now	,	right	,	but	sort	of	in	the	middle	of	my	questions	,	my	excited	questions	,	because	the	more	I	got	to	know	him	and	his	system	,	the	more	exciting	this	whole	idea	became	.
He	kept	going	like	this	to	me	.
And	I	thought	,	OK	,	excited	Jew	from	New	York	,	right	?
I	'm	talking	a	little	too	aggressively	,	whatever	,	so	you	know	,	I	slowed	down	.
And	finally	,	by	the	end	of	the	day	I	was	like	,	Ed-uar-do	,	you	know	like	this	?
But	he	was	still	going	like	this	.
I	figured	it	out	.
I	was	speaking	too	loudly	.
So	I	hushed	my	voice	.
I	kind	of	like	asked	these	questions	and	chatted	with	him	through	a	translator	in	kind	of	a	half	whisper	.
And	he	stopped	doing	this	.
And	amazingly	,	the	geese	who	were	on	the	other	side	of	the	paddock	when	I	was	around	--	``	Get	the	hell	away	from	this	kid	!	''	--
when	I	lowered	my	voice	,	they	all	came	right	up	to	us	.
Right	up	to	us	,	like	right	up	to	here	.
Right	along	the	fence	line	.
And	fence	line	was	amazing	in	itself	.
The	fence	--	like	this	conception	of	fence	that	we	have	it	's	totally	backward	with	him	.
The	electricity	on	this	fiberglass	fence	is	only	on	the	outside	.
He	rewired	it	.	He	invented	it	.
I	've	never	seen	it	.	Have	you	?
You	fence	in	animals	.	You	electrify	the	inside	.
He	does	n't	.
He	electrifies	only	the	outside	.
Why	?
Because	he	said	to	me	that	he	felt	like	the	geese	--	and	he	proved	this	actually	,	not	just	a	conceit	,	he	proved	this	--	the	geese	felt	manipulated	when	they	were	imprisoned	in	their	little	paddocks	.
Even	though	they	were	imprisoned	in	this	Garden	of	Eden	with	figs	and	everything	else	.
He	felt	like	they	felt	manipulated	.
So	he	got	rid	of	the	electricity	,	he	got	rid	of	current	on	the	inside	and	kept	it	on	the	outside	,	so	it	would	protect	them	against	coyotes	and	other	predators	.
Now	,	what	happened	?
They	ate	,	and	he	showed	me	on	a	chart	,	how	they	ate	about	20	percent	more	feed	to	feed	their	livers	.
The	landscape	is	incredible	.
I	mean	,	his	farm	is	incredible	.
It	really	is	the	Garden	of	Eden	.
There	's	figs	and	everything	else	there	for	the	taking	.
And	the	irony	of	ironies	is	because	Extremadura	,	the	area	--	what	does	Extremadura	mean	?
Extra	hard	land	,	right	?
Extra	difficult	.	Extra	hard	.
But	over	four	generations	,	he	and	his	family	have	literally	transformed	this	extra	hard	land	into	a	tasting	menu	.	Upgrades	the	life	for	these	geese	.
And	they	are	allowed	to	take	whatever	they	want	.
Another	irony	,	the	double	irony	is	that	on	the	figs	and	the	olives	,	Eduardo	can	make	more	money	selling	those	than	he	can	on	the	foie	gras	.
He	does	n't	care	.
He	lets	them	take	what	they	want	and	he	says	,	``	Usually	,	it	's	about	50	percent	.	They	're	very	fair	.	''
The	other	50	percent	,	he	takes	and	he	sells	and	he	makes	money	on	them	.
Part	of	the	income	for	his	farm	.
A	big	part	of	his	income	for	his	farm	.
But	he	never	controls	it	.
They	get	what	they	want	,	they	leave	the	rest	for	me	and	I	sell	it	.
His	biggest	obstacle	,	really	,	was	the	marketplace	,	which	demands	these	days	bright	yellow	foie	gras	.
That	's	how	I	've	been	trained	.
You	want	to	look	and	see	what	good	foie	gras	is	,	it	's	got	to	be	bright	yellow	.
It	's	the	indication	that	it	's	the	best	foie	gras	.
Well	,	because	he	does	n't	force	feed	,	because	he	does	n't	gavage	tons	of	corn	,	his	livers	were	pretty	grey	.
Or	they	were	.
But	he	found	this	wild	plant	called	the	Lupin	bush	.
The	Lupin	bush	,	it	's	all	around	Extremadura	.
He	let	it	go	to	seed	,	he	took	the	seeds	,	he	planted	it	on	his	30	acres	,	all	around	.
And	the	geese	love	the	Lupin	bush	.
Not	for	the	bush	,	but	for	the	seeds	.
And	when	they	eat	the	seeds	,	their	foie	gras	turns	yellow	.
Radioactive	yellow	.
Bright	yellow	.
Of	the	highest	quality	foie	gras	yellow	I	've	ever	seen	.
So	I	'm	listening	to	all	this	,	you	know	,	and	I	'm	like	,	is	this	guy	for	real	?	Is	he	making	some	of	this	up	?
Is	he	like	,	you	know	--	because	he	seemed	to	have	an	answer	for	everything	,	and	it	was	always	nature	.
It	was	never	him	.
And	I	was	like	,	you	know	,	I	always	get	a	little	,	like	,	weirded	out	by	people	who	deflect	everything	away	from	themselves	.
Because	,	really	,	they	want	you	to	look	at	themselves	,	right	?
But	he	deflected	everything	away	from	his	ingenuity	into	working	with	his	landscape	.
So	it	's	like	,	here	I	am	,	I	'm	on	the	fence	about	this	guy	,	but	increasingly	,	eating	up	his	every	word	.
And	we	're	sitting	there	,	and	I	hear	[	clapping	]	from	a	distance	,	so	I	look	over	.
And	he	grabs	my	arm	and	the	translator	's	,	and	ducks	us	under	a	bush	and	says	,	``	Watch	this	.	''
``	Shush	,	''	he	says	again	for	the	500th	time	to	me	.
``	Shush	,	watch	this	.	''
And	this	squadron	of	geese	come	over	.
[	Clapping	]	And	they	're	getting	louder	,	louder	,	louder	,	like	really	loud	,	right	over	us	.
And	like	airport	traffic	control	,	as	they	start	to	go	past	us	they	're	called	back	--	and	they	're	called	back	and	back	and	back	.
And	then	they	circle	around	.
And	his	geese	are	calling	up	now	to	the	wild	geese	.
[	Clapping	]	And	the	wild	geese	are	calling	down	.
[	Clapping	]	And	it	's	getting	louder	and	louder	and	they	circle	and	circle	and	they	land	.
And	I	'm	just	saying	,	``	No	way	.	''
No	way	.
And	I	look	at	Eduardo	,	who	's	near	tears	looking	at	this	,	and	I	say	,	``	You	're	telling	me	that	your	geese	are	calling	to	the	wild	geese	to	say	come	for	a	visit	?	''
And	he	says	,	``	No	,	no	,	no	.
They	've	come	to	stay	.	''
They	've	come	to	stay	?
It	's	like	the	DNA	of	a	goose	is	to	fly	south	in	the	winter	,	right	?
I	said	that	.	I	said	``	Is	n't	that	what	they	're	put	on	this	Earth	for	?
To	fly	south	in	the	winter	and	north	when	it	gets	warm	?	''
He	said	,	``	No	,	no	,	no	.
Their	DNA	is	to	find	the	conditions	that	are	conducive	to	life	.
To	happiness	.
They	find	it	here	.
They	do	n't	need	anything	more	.	''
They	stop	.	They	mate	with	his	domesticated	geese	,	and	his	flock	continues	.
Think	about	that	for	a	minute	.
It	's	brilliant	,	right	?
Imagine	--	I	do	n't	know	,	imagine	a	hog	farm	in	,	like	,	North	Carolina	,	and	a	wild	pig	comes	upon	a	factory	farm	and	decides	to	stay	.
So	how	did	it	taste	?
I	finally	got	to	taste	it	before	I	left	.
He	took	me	to	his	neighborhood	restaurant	and	he	served	me	some	of	his	foie	gras	,	confit	de	foie	gras	.
It	was	incredible	.
And	the	problem	with	saying	that	,	of	course	,	is	that	you	know	,	at	this	point	it	risks	hyperbole	really	easily	.
And	I	'd	like	to	make	a	metaphor	,	but	I	do	n't	have	one	really	.
I	was	drinking	this	guy	's	Kool-Aid	so	much	,	he	could	have	served	me	goose	feathers	and	I	would	have	been	like	,	this	guy	's	a	genius	,	you	know	?
I	'm	really	in	love	with	him	at	this	point	.
But	it	truly	was	the	best	foie	gras	of	my	life	.
So	much	so	that	I	do	n't	think	I	had	ever	really	had	foie	gras	until	that	moment	.
I	'd	had	something	that	was	called	foie	gras	.
But	this	was	transformative	.	Really	transformative	.
And	I	say	to	you	,	I	might	not	stick	to	this	,	but	I	do	n't	think	I	'll	ever	serve	foie	gras	on	my	menu	again	because	of	that	taste	experience	with	Eduardo	.
It	was	sweet	,	it	was	unctuous	.
It	had	all	the	qualities	of	foie	gras	,	but	its	fat	had	a	lot	of	integrity	and	a	lot	of	honesty	.
And	you	could	taste	herbs	,	you	could	taste	spices	.
And	I	kept	--	I	said	,	you	know	,	I	swear	to	God	I	tasted	star	anise	.
I	was	sure	of	it	.
And	I	'm	not	like	some	super	taster	,	you	know	?
But	I	can	taste	things	.
There	's	100	percent	star	anise	in	there	.
And	he	says	,	``	No	.	''
And	I	ended	up	like	going	down	the	spices	,	and	finally	,	it	was	like	,	OK	,	salt	and	pepper	,	thinking	he	's	salted	and	peppered	his	liver	.
But	no	.
He	takes	the	liver	when	he	harvests	the	foie	gras	,	he	sticks	them	in	this	jar
and	he	confits	it	.
No	salt	,	no	pepper	,	no	oil	,	no	spices	.
What	?
We	went	back	out	for	the	final	tour	of	the	farm	,	and	he	showed	me	the	wild	pepper	plants	and	the	plants	that	he	made	sure	existed	on	his	farm	for	salinity	.
He	does	n't	need	salt	and	pepper	.
And	he	does	n't	need	spices	,	because	he	's	got	this	potpourri	of	herbs	and	flavors
that	his	geese	love	to	gorge	on	.
I	turned	to	him	at	the	end	of	the	meal	,	and	it	's	a	question	I	asked	several	times	,	and	he	had	n't	,	kind	of	,	answered	me	directly	,	but	I	said	,	``	Now	look	,	you	're	in	Spain	,	some	of	the	greatest	chefs	in	the	world	are	--	Ferran	Adria	,	the	preeminent	chef	of	the	world	today	,	not	that	far	from	you	.
How	come	you	do	n't	give	him	this	?
How	come	no	one	's	really	heard	of	you	?	''
And	it	may	be	because	of	the	wine	,	or	it	may	be	because	of	my	excitement	,	he	answered	me	directly	and	he	said	,	``	Because	chefs	do	n't	deserve	my	foie	gras	.	''
And	he	was	right	.
He	was	right	.
Chefs	take	foie	gras	and	they	make	it	their	own	.
They	create	a	dish	where	all	the	vectors	point	at	us	.
With	Eduardo	it	's	about	the	expression	of	nature	.
And	as	he	said	,	I	think	fittingly	,	it	's	a	gift	from	God	,	with	God	saying	,	you	've	done	good	work	.
Simple	.
I	flew	home	,	I	'm	on	the	flight	with	my	little	black	book	and	I	took	,	you	know	,	pages	and	pages	of	notes	about	it	.
I	really	was	moved	.
And	in	the	corner	of	one	of	these	--	one	of	my	notes	,	is	this	note	that	says	,	when	asked	,	what	do	you	think	of	conventional	foie	gras	?
What	do	you	think	of	foie	gras	that	99.99999	percent	of	the	world	eats	?
He	said	,	``	I	think	it	's	an	insult	to	history	.	''
And	I	wrote	,	insult	to	history	.
I	'm	on	the	plane	and	I	'm	just	tearing	my	hair	out	.
It	's	like	,	why	did	n't	I	follow	up	on	that	?
What	the	hell	does	that	mean	?
Insult	to	history	.
So	I	did	some	research	when	I	got	back	,	and	here	's	what	I	found	.
The	history	of	foie	gras	.
Jews	invented	foie	gras	.
True	story	.
True	story	.
By	accident	.
They	were	looking	for	an	alternative	to	schmaltz	.
Gotten	sick	of	the	chicken	fat	.
They	were	looking	for	an	alternative	.
And	they	saw	in	the	fall	that	there	was	this	natural	,	beautiful	,	sweet	,	delicious	fat	from	geese	.
And	they	slaughtered	them	,	used	the	fat	throughout	the	winter	for	cooking	.
The	Pharaoh	got	wind	of	this	--	This	is	true	,	right	off	the	Internet	.
The	Pharaoh	got	--	I	swear	to	God	.
The	Pharaoh	got	wind	of	this	and	wanted	to	taste	it	.
He	tasted	it	and	fell	in	love	with	it	.
He	started	demanding	it	.
And	he	did	n't	want	it	just	in	the	fall	,	he	wanted	it	all	year	round	.
And	he	demanded	that	the	Jews	supply	enough	for	everyone	.
And	the	Jews	,	fearing	for	their	life	,	had	to	come	up	with	an	ingenious	idea	,	or	at	least	try	and	satisfy	the	Pharaoh	's	wishes	,	of	course	.
And	they	invented	,	what	?	Gavage	.
They	invented	gavage	in	a	great	moment	of	fear	for	their	lives	,	and	they	provided	the	Pharaoh	with	gavage	liver	,	and	the	good	stuff	they	kept	for	themselves	.
Supposedly	,	anyway	.	I	believe	that	one	.
That	's	the	history	of	foie	gras	.
And	if	you	think	about	it	,	it	's	the	history	of	industrial	agriculture	.
It	's	the	history	of	what	we	eat	today	.
Most	of	what	we	eat	today	.
Mega-farms	,	feed	lots	,	chemical	amendments	,	long-distance	travel	,	food	processing	.
All	of	it	,	our	food	system	.
That	's	also	an	insult	to	history	.
It	's	an	insult	to	the	basic	laws	of	nature	and	of	biology	.
Whether	we	're	talking	about	beef	cattle	or	we	're	talking	about	chickens	,	or	we	're	talking	about	broccoli	or	Brussels	sprouts	,	or	in	the	case	of	this	morning	's	New	York	Times	,	catfish	--	which	wholesale	are	going	out	of	business	.
Whatever	it	is	,	it	's	a	mindset	that	is	reminiscent	of	General	Motors	.
It	's	rooted	in	extraction	.
Take	more	,	sell	more	,	waste	more	.
And	for	the	future	it	wo	n't	serve	us	.
Jonas	Salk	has	a	great	quote	.
He	said	,	``	If	all	the	insects	disappeared	,	life	on	Earth	as	we	know	it	would	disappear	within	50	years	.
If	human	beings	disappeared	,	life	on	Earth	as	we	know	it	would	flourish	.	''
And	he	's	right	.
We	need	now	to	adopt	a	new	conception	of	agriculture	.
Really	new	.
One	in	which	we	stop	treating	the	planet	as	if	it	were	some	kind	of	business	in	liquidation	.
And	stop	degrading	resources	under	the	guise	of	cheap	food	.
We	can	start	by	looking	to	farmers	like	Eduardo	.
Farmers	that	rely	on	nature	for	solutions	,	for	answers	,	rather	than	imposing	solutions	on	nature	.
Listening	as	Janine	Benyus	,	one	of	my	favorite	writers	and	thinkers	about	this	topic	says	,	``	Listening	to	nature	's	operating	instructions	.	''
That	's	what	Eduardo	does	,	and	does	so	brilliantly	.
And	what	he	showed	me	and	what	he	can	show	all	of	us	,	I	think	,	is	that	the	great	thing	for	chefs	,	the	great	blessing	for	chefs	,	and	for	people	that	care	about	food	and	cooking	,	is	that	the	most	ecological	choice	for	food	is	also	the	most	ethical	choice	for	food	.
Whether	we	're	talking	about	Brussels	sprouts	or	foie	gras	.
And	it	's	also	almost	always	,	and	I	have	n't	found	an	example	otherwise	,	but	almost	always	,	the	most	delicious	choice	.
That	's	serendipitous	.
Thank	you	.
My	name	is	Amit	.
And	18	months	ago	,	I	had	another	job	at	Google	,	and	I	pitched	this	idea	of	doing	something	with	museums	and	art	to	my	boss	who	's	actually	here	,	and	she	allowed	me	to	do	it	.
And	it	took	18	months	.
A	lot	of	fun	,	negotiations	and	stories	,	I	can	tell	you	,	with	17	very	interesting	museums	from	nine	countries	.
But	I	'm	going	to	focus	on	the	demo	.
There	are	a	lot	of	stories	about	why	we	did	this	.
I	think	my	personal	story	is	explained	very	simply	on	the	slide	,	and	it	's	access	.
And	I	grew	up	in	India	.
I	had	a	great	education	--	I	'm	not	complaining	--	but	I	did	n't	have	access	to	a	lot	of	these	museums	and	these	artworks	.
And	so	when	I	started	traveling	and	going	to	these	museums	,	I	started	learning	a	lot	.
And	while	working	at	Google	,	I	tried	to	put	this	desire	to	make	it	more	accessible	with	technology	together	.
So	we	formed	a	team	,	a	great	team	of	people	,	and	we	started	doing	this	.
I	'm	going	to	probably	get	into	the	demo	and	then	tell	you	a	couple	of	the	interesting	things	we	've	had	since	launch	.
So	,	simple	:	you	come	to	GoogleArtProject.com	.
You	look	around	at	all	these	museums	here	.
You	've	got	the	Uffizi	,	you	've	got	the	MoMA	,	the	Hermitage	,	the	Rijks	,	the	Van	Gogh	.
I	'm	going	to	actually	get	to	one	of	my	favorites	,	the	Metropolitan	Museum	of	Art	in	New	York	.
Two	ways	of	going	in	--	very	simple	.
Click	and	,	bang	,	you	're	in	this	museum	.
It	does	n't	matter	where	you	are	--	Bombay	,	Mexico	,	it	does	n't	really	matter	.
You	move	around	,	you	have	fun	.
You	want	to	navigate	around	the	museum	?
Open	the	plan	up	,	and	,	in	one	click	,	jump	.
You	're	in	there	,	you	want	to	go	to	the	end	of	the	corridor	.
Keep	going	.	Have	fun	.
Explore	.
Thanks	.	I	have	n't	come	to	the	best	part	.
So	now	I	'm	in	front	of	one	of	my	favorite	paintings	,	``	The	Harvesters	''	by	Pieter	Bruegel	at	the	Met	.
I	see	this	plus	sign	.
If	the	museum	has	given	us	the	image	,	you	click	on	it	.
Now	this	is	one	of	the	images	.
So	this	is	all	of	the	meta-data	information	.
For	those	of	you	who	are	truly	interested	in	art	,	you	can	click	this	--	but	I	'm	going	to	click	this	off	right	now	.
And	this	is	one	of	these	images	that	we	captured	in	what	we	call	gigapixel	technology	.
So	this	image	,	for	example	,	has	close	to	,	I	think	,	around	10	billion	pixels	.
And	I	get	a	lot	of	people	asking	me	:	``	What	do	you	get	for	10	billion	pixels	?	''	So	I	'm	going	to	try	and	show	you	what	you	really	get	for	10	billion	pixels	.
You	can	zoom	around	very	simply	.
You	see	some	fun	stuff	happening	here	.
I	love	this	guy	;	his	expression	is	priceless	.
But	then	you	really	want	to	go	deep	.
And	so	I	started	playing	around	,	and	I	found	something	going	on	over	here	.
And	I	was	like	,	``	Hold	on	.	That	sounds	interesting	.	''	Went	in	,	and	I	started	noticing	that	these	kids	were	actually	beating	something	.
I	did	a	little	research	,	spoke	to	a	couple	of	my	contacts	at	the	Met	,	and	actually	found	out	that	this	is	a	game	called	squall	,	which	involves	beating	a	goose	with	a	stick	on	Shrove	Tuesday	.
And	apparently	it	was	quite	popular	.
I	do	n't	know	why	they	did	it	,	but	I	learned	something	about	it	.
Now	just	to	get	really	deep	in	,	you	can	really	get	to	the	cracks	.
Now	just	to	give	you	some	perspective	,	I	'm	going	to	zoom	out	so	you	really	see	what	you	get	.
Here	is	where	we	were	,	and	this	is	the	painting	.
The	best	is	yet	to	come	--	so	in	a	second	.
So	now	let	's	just	quickly	jump	into	the	MoMA	,	again	in	New	York	.
So	another	one	of	my	favorites	,	``	The	Starry	Night	.	''
Now	the	example	I	showed	you	was	all	about	finding	details	.
But	what	if	you	want	to	see	brush	strokes	?
And	what	if	you	want	to	see	how	Van	Gogh	actually	created	this	masterpiece	?
You	zoom	in	.	You	really	go	in	.
I	'm	going	to	go	to	one	of	my	favorite	parts	in	this	painting	,	and	I	'm	really	going	to	get	to	the	cracks	.
This	is	``	The	Starry	Night	,	''	I	think	,	never	seen	like	this	before	.
I	'm	going	to	show	you	my	other	favorite	feature	.
There	's	a	lot	of	other	stuff	here	,	but	I	do	n't	have	time	.
This	is	the	real	cool	part	.	It	's	called	Collections	.
Any	one	of	you	,	anybody	--	does	n't	matter	if	you	're	rich	,	if	you	're	poor	,	if	you	have	a	fancy	house	--	does	n't	matter	.
You	can	go	and	create	your	own	museum	online	--	create	your	own	collection	across	all	these	images	.
Very	simply	,	you	go	in	--	and	I	've	created	this	,	called	The	Power	of	Zoom	--	you	can	just	zoom	around	.
This	is	``	The	Ambassadors	,	''	based	in	the	National	Gallery	.
You	can	annotate	the	stuff	,	send	it	to	your	friends	and	really	get	a	conversation	going	about	what	you	're	feeling	when	you	go	through	these	masterpieces	.
So	I	think	,	in	conclusion	,	for	me	,	the	main	thing	is	that	all	the	amazing	stuff	here	does	not	really	come	from	Google	.
It	does	n't	,	in	my	opinion	,	even	come	from	the	museums	.
I	probably	should	n't	say	that	.
It	really	comes	from	these	artists	.
And	that	's	been	my	humbling	experience	in	this	.
I	mean	,	I	hope	in	this	digital	medium	that	we	do	justice	to	their	artwork	and	represent	it	properly	online	.
And	the	biggest	question	I	get	asked	nowadays	is	,	``	Did	you	do	this	to	replicate	the	experience	of	going	to	a	museum	?	''	And	the	answer	is	no	.
It	's	to	supplement	the	experience	.
And	that	's	it	.	Thank	you	.
Thank	you	.
You	will	understand	nothing	with	my	type	of	English	.
It	's	good	for	you	because	you	can	have	a	break	after	all	these	fantastic	people	.
I	must	tell	you	I	am	like	that	,	not	very	comfortable	,	because	usually	,	in	life	,	I	think	my	job	is	absolutely	useless	.
I	mean	,	I	feel	useless	.
Now	after	Carolyn	,	and	all	the	other	guys	,	I	feel	like	shit	.
And	definitively	,	I	do	n't	know	why	I	am	here	,	but	--	you	know	the	nightmare	you	can	have	,	like	you	are	an	impostor	,	you	arrive	at	the	opera	,	and	they	push	you	,	``	You	must	sing	!	''
I	do	n't	know	.
So	,	so	,	because	I	have	nothing	to	show	,	nothing	to	say	,	we	shall	try	to	speak	about	something	else	.
We	can	start	,	if	you	want	,	by	understanding	--	it	's	just	to	start	,	it	's	not	interesting	,	but	--	how	I	work	.
When	somebody	comes	to	me	and	ask	for	what	I	am	known	,	I	mean	,	yes	,	lemon	squeezer	,	toilet	brush	,	toothpick	,	beautiful	toilet	seats	,	and	why	not	--	a	toothbrush	?
I	do	n't	try	to	design	the	toothbrush	.
I	do	n't	try	to	say	,	``	Oh	,	that	will	be	a	beautiful	object	,	''	or	something	like	that	.
That	does	n't	interest	me	.
Because	there	is	different	types	of	design	.
The	one	,	we	can	call	it	the	cynical	design	,	that	means	the	design	invented	by	Raymond	Loewy	in	the	'50s	,	who	said	,	what	is	ugly	is	a	bad	sale	,	la	laideur	se	vend	mal	,	which	is	terrible	.
It	means	the	design	must	be	just	the	weapon	for	marketing	,	for	producer	to	make	product	more	sexy	,	like	that	,	they	sell	more	:	it	's	shit	,	it	's	obsolete	,	it	's	ridiculous	.
I	call	that	the	cynical	design	.
After	,	there	is	the	narcissistic	design	:	it	's	a	fantastic	designer	who	designs	only	for	other	fantastic	designers	.
After	,	there	is	people	like	me	,	who	try	to	deserve	to	exist	,	and	who	are	so	ashamed	to	make	this	useless	job	,	who	try	to	do	it	in	another	way	,	and	they	try	,	I	try	,	to	not	make	the	object	for	the	object	but	for	the	result	,	for	the	profit	for	the	human	being	,	the	person	who	will	use	it	.
If	we	take	the	toothbrush	--	I	do	n't	think	about	the	toothbrush	.	I	think	,	``	What	will	be	the	effect	of	the	brush	in	the	mouth	?	''
And	to	understand	what	will	be	the	effect	of	the	toothbrush	in	the	mouth	,	I	must	imagine	:	Who	owns	this	mouth	?
What	is	the	life	of	the	owner	of	this	mouth	?	In	what	society	[	does	]	this	guy	live	?
What	civilization	creates	this	society	?
What	animal	species	creates	this	civilization	?
When	I	arrive	--	and	I	take	one	minute	,	I	am	not	so	intelligent	--	when	I	arrive	at	the	level	of	animal	species	,	that	becomes	real	interesting	.
Me	,	I	have	strictly	no	power	to	change	anything	.
But	when	I	come	back	,	I	can	understand	why	I	shall	not	do	it	,	because	today	to	not	do	it	,	it	's	more	positive	than	do	it	,	or	how	I	shall	do	it	.
But	to	come	back	,	where	I	am	at	the	animal	species	,	there	is	things	to	see	.
There	is	things	to	see	,	there	is	the	big	challenge	.
The	big	challenge	in	front	of	us	.
Because	there	is	not	a	human	production	which	exists	outside	of	what	I	call	``	the	big	image	.	''	The	big	image	is	our	story	,	our	poetry	,	our	romanticism	.
Our	poetry	is	our	mutation	,	our	life	.
We	must	remember	,	and	we	can	see	that	in	any	book	of	my	son	of	10	years	old	,	that	life	appears	four	billion	years	ago	,	around	--	four	billion	point	two	?
Voice	offstage	:	Four	point	five	.
Yes	,	point	five	,	OK	,	OK	,	OK	!	I	'm	a	designer	,	that	's	all	,	of	Christmas	gifts	.
And	before	,	there	was	this	soup	,	called	``	soupe	primordiale	,	''	this	first	soup	--	bloop	bloop	bloop	--	sort	of	dirty	mud	,	no	life	,	nothing	.
So	then	--	pshoo-shoo	--	lightning	--	pshoo	--	arrive	--	pshoo-shoo	--	makes	life	--	bloop	bloop	--	and	that	dies	.
Some	million	years	after	--	pshoo-shoo	,	bloop-bloop	--	ah	,	wake	up	!
At	the	end	,	finally	,	that	succeeds	,	and	life	appears	.
We	was	so	,	so	stupid	.	The	most	stupid	bacteria	.
Even	,	I	think	,	we	copy	our	way	to	reproduce	,	you	know	what	I	mean	,	and	something	of	--	oh	no	,	forget	it	.
After	,	we	become	a	fish	;	after	,	we	become	a	frog	;	after	,	we	become	a	monkey	;	after	,	we	become	what	we	are	today	:	a	super-monkey	,	and	the	fun	is	,	the	super-monkey	we	are	today	,	is	at	half	of	the	story	.
Can	you	imagine	?	From	that	stupid	bacteria	to	us	,	with	a	microphone	,	with	a	computer	,	with	an	iPod	:	four	billion	years	.
And	we	know	,	and	especially	Carolyn	knows	,	that	when	the	sun	will	implode	,	the	earth	will	burn	,	explode	,	I	do	n't	know	what	,	and	this	is	scheduled	for	four	,	four	billion	years	?
Yes	,	she	said	,	something	like	that	.	OK	,	that	means	we	are	at	half	of	the	story	.
Fantastic	!	It	's	a	beauty	!
Can	you	imagine	?	It	's	very	symbolic	.
Because	the	bacteria	we	was	had	no	idea	of	what	we	are	today	.
And	today	,	we	have	no	idea	of	what	we	shall	be	in	four	billion	years	.
And	this	territory	is	fantastic	.
That	is	our	poetry	.	That	is	our	beautiful	story	.
It	's	our	romanticism	.	Mu-ta-tion	.	We	are	mutants	.
And	if	we	do	n't	deeply	understand	,	if	we	do	n't	integrate	that	we	are	mutants	,	we	completely	miss	the	story	.
Because	every	generation	thinks	we	are	the	final	one	.
We	have	a	way	to	look	at	Earth	like	that	,	you	know	,	``	I	am	the	man	.	The	final	man	.
You	know	,	we	mutate	during	four	billion	years	before	,	but	now	,	because	it	's	me	,	we	stop	.	Fin	.
For	the	end	,	for	the	eternity	,	it	is	one	with	a	red	jacket	.	''
Something	like	that	.	I	am	not	sure	of	that	.
Because	that	is	our	intelligence	of	mutation	and	things	like	that	.
There	is	so	many	things	to	do	;	it	's	so	fresh	.
And	here	is	something	:	nobody	is	obliged	to	be	a	genius	,	but	everybody	is	obliged	to	participate	.
And	to	participate	,	for	a	mutant	,	there	is	a	minimum	of	exercise	,	a	minimum	of	sport	.
We	can	say	that	.
The	first	,	if	you	want	--	there	is	so	many	--	but	one	which	is	very	easy	to	do	,	is	the	duty	of	vision	.
I	can	explain	you	.	I	shall	try	.
If	you	walk	like	that	,	it	's	OK	,	it	's	OK	,	you	can	walk	,	but	perhaps	,	because	you	walk	with	the	eyes	like	that	,	you	will	not	see	,	oh	,	there	is	a	hole	.
And	you	will	fall	,	and	you	will	die	.	Dangerous	.
That	's	why	,	perhaps	,	you	will	try	to	have	this	angle	of	vision	.
OK	,	I	can	see	,	if	I	found	something	,	up	,	up	,	and	they	continue	,	up	up	up	.
I	raise	the	angle	of	vision	,	but	it	's	still	very	--	selfish	,	selfish	,	egoiste	--	yes	,	selfish	.
You	,	you	survive	.	It	's	OK	.
If	you	raise	the	level	of	your	eyes	a	little	more	you	go	,	``	I	see	you	,	oh	my	God	you	are	here	,	how	are	you	,	I	can	help	you	,
I	can	design	for	you	a	new	toothbrush	,	new	toilet	brush	,	''	something	like	that	.
I	live	in	society	;	I	live	in	community	.
It	's	OK.	You	start	to	be	in	the	territory	of	intelligence	,	we	can	say	.
From	this	level	,	the	more	you	can	raise	this	angle	of	view	,	the	more	you	will	be	important	for	the	society	.
The	more	you	will	rise	,	the	more	you	will	be	important	for	the	civilization	.
The	more	you	will	rise	,	to	see	far	and	high	,	like	that	,	the	more	you	will	be	important	for	the	story	of	our	mutation	.
That	means	intelligent	people	are	in	this	angle	.	That	is	intelligence	.
From	this	to	here	,	that	,	it	's	genius	.
Ptolemy	,	Eratosthenes	,	Einstein	,	things	like	that	.
Nobody	's	obliged	to	be	a	genius	.
It	's	better	,	but	nobody	.
Take	care	,	in	this	training	,	to	be	a	good	mutant	.	There	is	some	danger	,	there	is	some	trap	.	One	trap	:	the	vertical	.
Because	at	the	vertical	of	us	,	if	you	look	like	that	,	``	Ah	!	my	God	,	there	is	God	.	Ah	!	God	!	''
God	is	a	trap	.	God	is	the	answer	when	we	do	n't	know	the	answer	.
That	means	,	when	your	brain	is	not	enough	big	,	when	you	do	n't	understand	,	you	go	,	``	Ah	,	it	's	God	,	it	's	God	.	''	That	's	ridiculous	.
That	's	why	--	jump	,	like	that	?	No	,	do	n't	jump	.
Come	back	.	Because	,	after	,	there	is	another	trap	.
If	you	look	like	that	,	you	look	to	the	past	,	or	you	look	inside	if	you	are	very	flexible	,	inside	yourself	.
It	's	called	schizophrenia	,	and	you	are	dead	also	.
That	's	why	every	morning	,	now	,	because	you	are	a	good	mutant	,	you	will	raise	your	angle	of	view	.
Out	,	more	of	the	horizontal	.	You	are	an	intelligence	.
Never	forget	--	like	that	,	like	that	.
It	's	very	,	very	,	very	important	.
What	,	what	else	we	can	say	about	that	?	Why	do	that	?
It	's	because	we	--	if	we	look	from	far	,	we	see	our	line	of	evolution	.
This	line	of	evolution	is	clearly	positive	.
From	far	,	this	line	looks	very	smooth	,	like	that	.
But	if	you	take	a	lens	,	like	that	,	this	line	is	ack	,	ack	,	ack	,	ack	,	ack	.	Like	that	.
It	's	made	of	light	and	shadow	.
We	can	say	light	is	civilization	,	shadow	is	barbaria	.
And	it	's	very	important	to	know	where	we	are	.
Because	some	cycle	,	there	is	a	spot	in	the	cycle	,	and	you	have	not	the	same	duty	in	the	different	parts	of	the	cycle	.
That	means	,	we	can	imagine	--	I	do	n't	say	it	was	fantastic	,	but	in	the	'80s	,	there	was	not	too	much	war	,	like	that	,	it	was	--	we	can	imagine	that	the	civilization	can	become	civilized	.
In	this	case	,	people	like	me	are	acceptable	.
We	can	say	,	``	It	's	luxurious	time	.	''
We	have	time	to	think	,	we	have	time	to	I	do	n't	know	what	,	speak	about	art	and	things	like	that	.
It	's	OK.	We	are	in	the	light	.
But	sometimes	,	like	today	,	we	fall	,	we	fall	so	fast	,	so	fast	to	shadow	,	we	fall	so	fast	to	barbaria	.
With	many	,	many	,	many	,	many	face	of	barbaria	.
Because	it	's	not	,	the	barbaria	we	have	today	,	it	's	perhaps	not	the	barbaria	we	think	.
There	is	different	type	of	barbaria	.
That	's	why	we	must	adapt	.
That	means	,	when	barbaria	is	back	,	forget	the	beautiful	chairs	,	forget	the	beautiful	hotel	,	forget	design	,	even	--	I	'm	sorry	to	say	--	forget	art	.
Forget	all	that	.	There	is	priority	;	there	is	urgency	.
You	must	go	back	to	politics	,	you	must	go	back	to	radicalization	,
I	'm	sorry	if	that	's	not	very	English	.
You	must	go	back	to	fight	,	to	battle	.
That	's	why	today	I	'm	so	ashamed	to	make	this	job	.
That	's	why	I	am	here	,	to	try	to	do	it	the	best	possible	.
But	I	know	that	even	I	do	it	the	best	possible	--	that	's	why	I	'm	the	best	--	it	's	nothing	.
Because	it	's	not	the	right	time	.
That	's	why	I	say	that	.	I	say	that	,	because	,	I	repeat	,	nothing	exist	if	it	's	not	in	the	good	reason	,	the	reason	of	our	beautiful	dream	,	of	this	civilization	.
And	because	we	must	all	work	to	finish	this	story	.
Because	the	scenario	of	this	civilization	--	about	love	,	progress	,	and	things	like	that	--	it	's	OK	,	but	there	is	so	many	different	,	other	scenarios	of	other	civilizations	.
This	scenario	,	of	this	civilization	,	was	about	becoming	powerful	,	intelligent	,	like	this	idea	we	have	invented	,	this	concept	of	God	.
We	are	God	now	.	We	are	.	It	's	almost	done	.
We	have	just	to	finish	the	story	.
That	is	very	,	very	important	.
And	when	you	do	n't	understand	really	what	's	happened	,	you	can	not	go	and	fight	and	work	and	build	and	things	like	that	.
You	go	to	the	future	back	,	back	,	back	,	back	,	like	that	.
And	you	can	fall	,	and	it	's	very	dangerous	.
No	,	you	must	really	understand	that	.
Because	we	have	almost	finished	,	I	'll	repeat	this	story	.
And	the	beauty	of	this	,	in	perhaps	50	years	,	60	years	,	we	can	finish	completely	this	civilization	,
and	offer	to	our	children	the	possibility	to	invent	a	new	story	,	a	new	poetry	,	a	new	romanticism	.
With	billions	of	people	who	have	been	born	,	worked	,	lived	and	died	before	us	,	these	people	who	have	worked	so	much	,	we	have	now	bring	beautiful	things	,	beautiful	gifts	,	we	know	so	many	things	.
We	can	say	to	our	children	,	OK	,	done	,	that	was	our	story	.	That	passed	.	Now	you	have	a	duty	:	invent	a	new	story	.	Invent	a	new	poetry	.
The	only	rule	is	,	we	have	not	to	have	any	idea	about	the	next	story	.
We	give	you	white	pages	.	Invent	.
We	give	you	the	best	tools	,	the	best	tools	,	and	now	,	do	it	.
That	's	why	I	continue	to	work	,	even	if	it	's	for	toilet	brush	.
Companies	are	losing	control	.
What	happens	on	Wall	Street	no	longer	stays	on	Wall	Street	.
What	happens	in	Vegas	ends	up	on	YouTube	.
Reputations	are	volatile	.	Loyalties	are	fickle	.
Management	teams	seem	increasingly	disconnected	from	their	staff	.
A	recent	survey	said	that	27	percent	of	bosses	believe	their	employees	are	inspired	by	their	firm	.
However	,	in	the	same	survey	,	only	four	percent	of	employees	agreed	.
Companies	are	losing	control	of	their	customers	and	their	employees	.
But	are	they	really	?
I	'm	a	marketer	,	and	as	a	marketer	,	I	know	that	I	've	never	really	been	in	control	.
Your	brand	is	what	other	people	say	about	you	when	you	're	not	in	the	room	,	the	saying	goes	.
Hyperconnectivity	and	transparency	allow	companies	to	be	in	that	room	now	,	24/7	.
They	can	listen	and	join	the	conversation	.
In	fact	,	they	have	more	control	over	the	loss	of	control	than	ever	before	.
They	can	design	for	it	.	But	how	?
First	of	all	,	they	can	give	employees	and	customers	more	control	.
They	can	collaborate	with	them	on	the	creation	of	ideas	,	knowledge	,	content	,	designs	and	product	.
They	can	give	them	more	control	over	pricing	,	which	is	what	the	band	Radiohead	did	with	its	pay-as-you-like	online	release	of	its	album	``	In	Rainbows	.	''	Buyers	could	determine	the	price	,	but	the	offer	was	exclusive	,	and	only	stood	for	a	limited	period	of	time	.
The	album	sold	more	copies	than	previous	releases	of	the	band	.
The	Danish	chocolate	company	Anthon	Berg	opened	a	so-called	``	generous	store	''	in	Copenhagen	.
It	asked	customers	to	purchase	chocolate	with	the	promise	of	good	deeds	towards	loved	ones	.
It	turned	transactions	into	interactions	,	and	generosity	into	a	currency	.
Companies	can	even	give	control	to	hackers	.
When	Microsoft	Kinect	came	out	,	the	motion-controlled	add-on	to	its	Xbox	gaming	console	,	it	immediately	drew	the	attention	of	hackers	.
Microsoft	first	fought	off	the	hacks	,	but	then	shifted	course	when	it	realized	that	actively	supporting	the	community	came	with	benefits	.
The	sense	of	co-ownership	,	the	free	publicity	,	the	added	value	,	all	helped	drive	sales	.
The	ultimate	empowerment	of	customers	is	to	ask	them	not	to	buy	.
Outdoor	clothier	Patagonia	encouraged	prospective	buyers	to	check	out	eBay	for	its	used	products	and	to	resole	their	shoes	before	purchasing	new	ones	.
In	an	even	more	radical	stance	against	consumerism	,	the	company	placed	a	``	Do	n't	Buy	This	Jacket	''	advertisement	during	the	peak	of	shopping	season	.
It	may	have	jeopardized	short-term	sales	,	but	it	builds	lasting	,	long-term	loyalty	based	on	shared	values	.
Research	has	shown	that	giving	employees	more	control	over	their	work	makes	them	happier	and	more	productive	.
The	Brazilian	company	Semco	Group	famously	lets	employees	set	their	own	work	schedules	and	even	their	salaries	.
Hulu	and	Netflix	,	among	other	companies	,	have	open	vacation	policies	.
Companies	can	give	people	more	control	,	but	they	can	also	give	them	less	control	.
Traditional	business	wisdom	holds	that	trust	is	earned	by	predictable	behavior	,	but	when	everything	is	consistent	and	standardized	,	how	do	you	create	meaningful	experiences	?
Giving	people	less	control	might	be	a	wonderful	way	to	counter	the	abundance	of	choice	and	make	them	happier	.
Take	the	travel	service	Nextpedition	.
Nextpedition	turns	the	trip	into	a	game	,	with	surprising	twists	and	turns	along	the	way	.
It	does	not	tell	the	traveler	where	she	's	going	until	the	very	last	minute	,	and	information	is	provided	just	in	time	.	Similarly	,	Dutch	airline	KLM	launched	a	surprise	campaign	,	seemingly	randomly	handing	out	small	gifts	to	travelers	en	route	to	their	destination	.
U.K.-based	Interflora	monitored	Twitter	for	users	who	were	having	a	bad	day	,	and	then	sent	them	a	free	bouquet	of	flowers	.
Is	there	anything	companies	can	do	to	make	their	employees	feel	less	pressed	for	time	?	Yes	.
Force	them	to	help	others	.
A	recent	study	suggests	that	having	employees	complete	occasional	altruistic	tasks	throughout	the	day	increases	their	sense	of	overall	productivity	.
At	Frog	,	the	company	I	work	for	,	we	hold	internal	speed	meet	sessions	that	connect	old	and	new	employees	,	helping	them	get	to	know	each	other	fast	.
By	applying	a	strict	process	,	we	give	them	less	control	,	less	choice	,	but	we	enable	more	and	richer	social	interactions	.
Companies	are	the	makers	of	their	fortunes	,	and	like	all	of	us	,	they	are	utterly	exposed	to	serendipity	.
That	should	make	them	more	humble	,	more	vulnerable	and	more	human	.
At	the	end	of	the	day	,	as	hyperconnectivity	and	transparency	expose	companies	'	behavior	in	broad	daylight	,	staying	true	to	their	true	selves	is	the	only	sustainable	value	proposition	.
Or	as	the	ballet	dancer	Alonzo	King	said	,	``	What	's	interesting	about	you	is	you	.	''
For	the	true	selves	of	companies	to	come	through	,	openness	is	paramount	,	but	radical	openness	is	not	a	solution	,	because	when	everything	is	open	,	nothing	is	open	.
``	A	smile	is	a	door	that	is	half	open	and	half	closed	,	''	the	author	Jennifer	Egan	wrote	.
Companies	can	give	their	employees	and	customers	more	control	or	less	.	They	can	worry	about	how	much	openness	is	good	for	them	,	and	what	needs	to	stay	closed	.
Or	they	can	simply	smile	,	and	remain	open	to	all	possibilities	.
Thank	you	.
This	is	Revolution	2.0	.
No	one	was	a	hero	.	No	one	was	a	hero	.
Because	everyone	was	a	hero	.
Everyone	has	done	something	.
We	all	use	Wikipedia	.
If	you	think	of	the	concept	of	Wikipedia	where	everyone	is	collaborating	on	content	,
and	at	the	end	of	the	day	you	've	built	the	largest	encyclopedia	in	the	world	.
From	just	an	idea	that	sounded	crazy	,	you	have	the	largest	encyclopedia	in	the	world	.
And	in	the	Egyptian	revolution	,	the	Revolution	2.0	,	everyone	has	contributed	something	,	small	or	big	.	They	contributed	something	--	to	bring	us	one	of	the	most	inspiring	stories	in	the	history	of	mankind	when	it	comes	to	revolutions	.
It	was	actually	really	inspiring	to	see	all	these	Egyptians	completely	changing	.
If	you	look	at	the	scene	,	Egypt	,	for	30	years	,	had	been	in	a	downhill	--	going	into	a	downhill	.
Everything	was	going	bad	.
Everything	was	going	wrong	.
We	only	ranked	high	when	it	comes	to	poverty	,	corruption	,	lack	of	freedom	of	speech	,	lack	of	political	activism	.
Those	were	the	achievements	of	our	great	regime	.
Yet	,	nothing	was	happening	.
And	it	's	not	because	people	were	happy	or	people	were	not	frustrated	.
In	fact	,	people	were	extremely	frustrated	.
But	the	reason	why	everyone	was	silent	is	what	I	call	the	psychological	barrier	of	fear	.
Everyone	was	scared	.
Not	everyone	.	There	were	actually	a	few	brave	Egyptians	that	I	have	to	thank	for	being	so	brave	--	going	into	protests	as	a	couple	of	hundred	,	getting	beaten	up	and	arrested	.
But	in	fact	,	the	majority	were	scared	.
Everyone	did	not	want	really	to	get	in	trouble	.
A	dictator	can	not	live	without	the	force	.
They	want	to	make	people	live	in	fear	.
And	that	psychological	barrier	of	fear	had	worked	for	so	many	years	,	and	here	comes	the	Internet	,	technology	,	BlackBerry	,	SMS	.
It	's	helping	all	of	us	to	connect	.
Platforms	like	YouTube	,	Twitter	,	Facebook	were	helping	us	a	lot	because	it	basically	gave	us	the	impression	that	,	``	Wow	,	I	'm	not	alone	.
There	are	a	lot	of	people	who	are	frustrated	.	''	There	are	lots	of	people	who	are	frustrated	.
There	are	lots	of	people	who	actually	share	the	same	dream	.
There	are	lots	of	people	who	care	about	their	freedom	.
They	probably	have	the	best	life	in	the	world	.
They	are	living	in	happiness	.	They	are	living	in	their	villas	.
They	are	happy	.	They	do	n't	have	problems	.
But	they	are	still	feeling	the	pain	of	the	Egyptian	.
A	lot	of	us	,	we	're	not	really	happy	when	we	see	a	video	of	an	Egyptian	man	who	's	eating	the	trash	while	others	are	stealing	billions	of	Egyptian	pounds	from	the	wealth	of	the	country	.
The	Internet	has	played	a	great	role	,	helping	these	people	to	speak	up	their	minds	,	to	collaborate	together	,	to	start	thinking	together	.
It	was	an	educational	campaign	.
Khaled	Saeed	was	killed	in	June	2010	.
I	still	remember	the	photo	.
I	still	remember	every	single	detail	of	that	photo	.
The	photo	was	horrible	.
He	was	tortured	,	brutally	tortured	to	death	.
But	then	what	was	the	answer	of	the	regime	?
``	He	choked	on	a	pile	of	hash	''	--
that	was	their	answer	:	``	He	's	a	criminal	.
He	's	someone	who	escaped	from	all	these	bad	things	.	''	But	people	did	not	relate	to	this	.
People	did	not	believe	this	.
Because	of	the	Internet	,	the	truth	prevailed	and	everyone	knew	the	truth	.
And	everyone	started	to	think	that	``	this	guy	could	be	my	brother	.	''	He	was	a	middle-class	guy	.
His	photo	was	remembered	by	all	of	us	.
A	page	was	created	.
An	anonymous	administrator	was	basically	inviting	people	to	join	the	page	,	and	there	was	no	plan	.
``	What	are	we	going	to	do	?	''	``	I	do	n't	know	.	''	In	a	few	days	,	tens	of	thousands	of	people	there	--	angry	Egyptians	who	were	asking	the	ministry	of	interior	affairs	,	``	Enough	.
Get	those	who	killed	this	guy	.	To	just	bring	them	to	justice	.	''	But	of	course	,	they	do	n't	listen	.
It	was	an	amazing	story	--	how	everyone	started	feeling	the	ownership	.
Everyone	was	an	owner	in	this	page	.
People	started	contributing	ideas	.
In	fact	,	one	of	the	most	ridiculous	ideas	was	,	``	Hey	,	let	's	have	a	silent	stand	.
Let	's	get	people	to	go	in	the	street	,	face	the	sea	,	their	back	to	the	street	,	dressed	in	black	,	standing	up	silently	for	one	hour	,	doing	nothing	and	then	just	leaving	,	going	back	home	.	''
For	some	people	,	that	was	like	,	``	Wow	,	silent	stand	.
And	next	time	it	's	going	to	be	vibration	.	''	People	were	making	fun	of	the	idea	.
But	actually	when	people	went	to	the	street	--	the	first	time	it	was	thousands	of	people	in	Alexandria	--	it	felt	like	--	it	was	amazing	.	It	was	great
because	it	connected	people	from	the	virtual	world	,	bringing	them	to	the	real	world	,	sharing	the	same	dream	,	the	same	frustration	,	the	same	anger	,	the	same	desire	for	freedom	.
And	they	were	doing	this	thing	.
But	did	the	regime	learn	anything	?	Not	really	.
They	were	actually	attacking	them	.
They	were	actually	abusing	them	,	despite	the	fact	of	how	peaceful	these	guys	were	--	they	were	not	even	protesting	.
And	things	had	developed	until	the	Tunisian	revolution	.
This	whole	page	was	,	again	,	managed	by	the	people	.
In	fact	,	the	anonymous	admin	job	was	to	collect	ideas	,	help	people	to	vote	on	them	and	actually	tell	them	what	they	are	doing	.
People	were	taking	shots	and	photos	;	people	were	reporting	violations	of	human	rights	in	Egypt	;	people	were	suggesting	ideas	,	they	were	actually	voting	on	ideas	,	and	then	they	were	executing	the	ideas	;	people	were	creating	videos	.
Everything	was	done	by	the	people	to	the	people	,	and	that	's	the	power	of	the	Internet	.
There	was	no	leader	.
The	leader	was	everyone	on	that	page	.
The	Tunisian	experiment	,	as	Amir	was	saying	,	inspired	all	of	us	,	showed	us	that	there	is	a	way	.
Yes	we	can	.	We	can	do	it	.
We	have	the	same	problems	;	we	can	just	go	in	the	streets	.
And	when	I	saw	the	street	on	the	25th	,	I	went	back	and	said	,	``	Egypt	before	the	25th	is	never	going	to	be	Egypt	after	the	25th	.
The	revolution	is	happening	.
This	is	not	the	end	,	this	is	the	beginning	of	the	end	.	''	I	was	detained	on	the	27th	night	.
Thank	God	I	announced	the	locations	and	everything	.
But	they	detained	me	.
And	I	'm	not	going	to	talk	about	my	experience	,	because	this	is	not	about	me	.
I	was	detained	for	12	days	,	blindfolded	,	handcuffed	.
And	I	did	not	really	hear	anything	.	I	did	not	know	anything	.
I	was	not	allowed	to	speak	with	anyone	.
And	I	went	out	.
The	next	day	I	was	in	Tahrir	.
Seriously	,	with	the	amount	of	change	I	had	noticed	in	this	square	,	I	thought	it	was	12	years	.
I	never	had	in	my	mind	to	see	this	Egyptian	,	the	amazing	Egyptian	.
The	fear	is	no	longer	fear	.
It	's	actually	strength	--	it	's	power	.
People	were	so	empowered	.
It	was	amazing	how	everyone	was	so	empowered	and	now	asking	for	their	rights	.
Completely	opposite	.
Extremism	became	tolerance	.
Who	would	[	have	]	imagined	before	the	25th	,	if	I	tell	you	that	hundreds	of	thousands	of	Christians	are	going	to	pray	and	tens	of	thousands	of	Muslims	are	going	to	protect	them	,	and	then	hundreds	of	thousands	of	Muslims	are	going	to	pray	and	tens	of	thousands	of	Christians	are	going	to	protect	them	--	this	is	amazing	.
All	the	stereotypes	that	the	regime	was	trying	to	put	on	us	through	their	so-called	propaganda	,	or	mainstream	media	,	are	proven	wrong	.
This	whole	revolution	showed	us	how	ugly	such	a	regime	was	and	how	great	and	amazing	the	Egyptian	man	,	the	Egyptian	woman	,	how	simple	and	amazing	these	people	are	whenever	they	have	a	dream	.
When	I	saw	that	,	I	went	back	and	I	wrote	on	Facebook	.
And	that	was	a	personal	belief	,	regardless	of	what	's	going	on	,	regardless	of	the	details	.
I	said	that	,	``	We	are	going	to	win	.
We	are	going	to	win	because	we	do	n't	understand	politics	.
We	're	going	to	win	because	we	do	n't	play	their	dirty	games	.
We	're	going	to	win	because	we	do	n't	have	an	agenda	.
We	're	going	to	win	because	the	tears	that	come	from	our	eyes	actually	come	from	our	hearts	.
We	're	going	to	win	because	we	have	dreams	.
We	're	going	to	win	because	we	are	willing	to	stand	up	for	our	dreams	.	''	And	that	's	actually	what	happened	.	We	won	.
And	that	's	not	because	of	anything	,	but	because	we	believed	in	our	dream	.
The	winning	here	is	not	the	whole	details	of	what	's	going	to	happen	in	the	political	scene	.
The	winning	is	the	winning	of	the	dignity	of	every	single	Egyptian	.
Actually	,	I	had	this	taxi	driver	telling	me	,	``	Listen	,	I	am	breathing	freedom	.
I	feel	that	I	have	dignity	that	I	have	lost	for	so	many	years	.	''	For	me	that	's	winning	,	regardless	of	all	the	details	.
My	last	word	to	you	is	a	statement	I	believe	in	,	which	Egyptians	have	proven	to	be	true	,
that	the	power	of	the	people	is	much	stronger	than	the	people	in	power	.
Thanks	a	lot	.
I	want	you	to	take	a	look	at	this	baby	.
What	you	're	drawn	to	are	her	eyes	and	the	skin	you	love	to	touch	.
But	today	I	'm	going	to	talk	to	you	about	something	you	ca	n't	see	--	what	's	going	on	up	in	that	little	brain	of	hers	.
The	modern	tools	of	neuroscience	are	demonstrating	to	us	that	what	's	going	on	up	there	is	nothing	short	of	rocket	science	.
And	what	we	're	learning	is	going	to	shed	some	light	on	what	the	romantic	writers	and	poets	described	as	the	``	celestial	openness	''	of	the	child	's	mind	.
What	we	see	here	is	a	mother	in	India	,
and	she	's	speaking	Koro	,	which	is	a	newly	discovered	language	.
And	she	's	talking	to	her	baby	.
What	this	mother	--	and	the	800	people	who	speak	Koro	in	the	world	--	understands	[	is	]	that	,	to	preserve	this	language	,	they	need	to	speak	it	to	the	babies	.
And	therein	lies	a	critical	puzzle	.
Why	is	it	that	you	ca	n't	preserve	a	language	by	speaking	to	you	and	I	,	to	the	adults	?
Well	,	it	's	got	to	do	with	your	brain	.
What	we	see	here	is	that	language	has	a	critical	period	for	learning	.
The	way	to	read	this	slide	is	to	look	at	your	age	on	the	horizontal	axis	.
And	you	'll	see	on	the	vertical	your	skill	at	acquiring	a	second	language	.
Babies	and	children	are	geniuses	until	they	turn	seven	,	and	then	there	's	a	systematic	decline	.
After	puberty	,	we	fall	off	the	map	.
No	scientists	dispute	this	curve	,	but	laboratories	all	over	the	world	are	trying	to	figure	out	why	it	works	this	way	.
Work	in	my	lab	is	focused	on	the	first	critical	period	in	development	--	and	that	is	the	period	in	which	babies	try	to	master	which	sounds	are	used	in	their	language	.
We	think	,	by	studying	how	the	sounds	are	learned	,	we	'll	have	a	model	for	the	rest	of	language	,	and	perhaps	for	critical	periods	that	may	exist	in	childhood	for	social	,	emotional	and	cognitive	development	.
So	we	've	been	studying	the	babies	using	a	technique	that	we	're	using	all	over	the	world	and	the	sounds	of	all	languages	.
The	baby	sits	on	a	parent	's	lap	,	and	we	train	them	to	turn	their	heads	when	a	sound	changes	--	like	from	``	ah	''	to	``	ee	.	''	If	they	do	so	at	the	appropriate	time	,	the	black	box	lights	up	and	a	panda	bear	pounds	a	drum	.
A	six-monther	adores	the	task	.
What	have	we	learned	?
Well	,	babies	all	over	the	world	are	what	I	like	to	describe	as	``	citizens	of	the	world	.	''	They	can	discriminate	all	the	sounds	of	all	languages	,	no	matter	what	country	we	're	testing	and	what	language	we	're	using	,
and	that	's	remarkable	because	you	and	I	ca	n't	do	that	.
We	're	culture-bound	listeners	.
We	can	discriminate	the	sounds	of	our	own	language	,	but	not	those	of	foreign	languages	.
So	the	question	arises	:	when	do	those	citizens	of	the	world	turn	into	the	language-bound	listeners	that	we	are	?
And	the	answer	:	before	their	first	birthdays	.
What	you	see	here	is	performance	on	that	head-turn	task	for	babies	tested	in	Tokyo	and	the	United	States	,	here	in	Seattle	,	as	they	listened	to	``	ra	''	and	``	la	''	--	sounds	important	to	English	,	but	not	to	Japanese	.
So	at	six	to	eight	months	the	babies	are	totally	equivalent	.
Two	months	later	something	incredible	occurs	.
The	babies	in	the	United	States	are	getting	a	lot	better	,	babies	in	Japan	are	getting	a	lot	worse	,	but	both	of	those	groups	of	babies	are	preparing	for	exactly	the	language	that	they	are	going	to	learn	.
So	the	question	is	:	what	's	happening	during	this	critical	two-month	period	?
This	is	the	critical	period	for	sound	development	,	but	what	's	going	on	up	there	?
So	there	are	two	things	going	on	.
The	first	is	that	the	babies	are	listening	intently	to	us	,	and	they	're	taking	statistics	as	they	listen	to	us	talk	--	they	're	taking	statistics	.
So	listen	to	two	mothers	speaking	motherese	--	the	universal	language	we	use	when	we	talk	to	kids	--	first	in	English	and	then	in	Japanese	.	English	Mother	:	Ah	,	I	love	your	big	blue	eyes	--	so	pretty	and	nice	.
Japanese	Mother	:	[	Japanese	]	Patricia	Kuhl	:	During	the	production	of	speech	,	when	babies	listen	,	what	they	're	doing	is	taking	statistics	on	the	language	that	they	hear	.
And	those	distributions	grow	.
And	what	we	've	learned	is	that	babies	are	sensitive	to	the	statistics	,	and	the	statistics	of	Japanese	and	English	are	very	,	very	different	.	English	has	a	lot	of	Rs	and	Ls	.	The	distribution	shows	.
And	the	distribution	of	Japanese	is	totally	different	,	where	we	see	a	group	of	intermediate	sounds	,	which	is	known	as	the	Japanese	``	R	.	''
So	babies	absorb	the	statistics	of	the	language	and	it	changes	their	brains	;	it	changes	them	from	the	citizens	of	the	world	to	the	culture-bound	listeners	that	we	are	.
But	we	as	adults	are	no	longer	absorbing	those	statistics	.
We	're	governed	by	the	representations	in	memory	that	were	formed	early	in	development	.
So	what	we	're	seeing	here	is	changing	our	models	of	what	the	critical	period	is	about	.
We	're	arguing	from	a	mathematical	standpoint	that	the	learning	of	language	material	may	slow	down	when	our	distributions	stabilize	.
It	's	raising	lots	of	questions	about	bilingual	people	.
Bilinguals	must	keep	two	sets	of	statistics	in	mind	at	once	and	flip	between	them	,	one	after	the	other	,	depending	on	who	they	're	speaking	to	.
So	we	asked	ourselves	,	can	the	babies	take	statistics	on	a	brand	new	language	?
And	we	tested	this	by	exposing	American	babies	who	'd	never	heard	a	second	language	to	Mandarin	for	the	first	time	during	the	critical	period	.
We	knew	that	,	when	monolinguals	were	tested	in	Taipei	and	Seattle	on	the	Mandarin	sounds	,	they	showed	the	same	pattern	.
Six	to	eight	months	,	they	're	totally	equivalent	.
Two	months	later	,	something	incredible	happens	.
But	the	Taiwanese	babies	are	getting	better	,	not	the	American	babies	.
What	we	did	was	expose	American	babies	during	this	period	to	Mandarin	.
It	was	like	having	Mandarin	relatives	come	and	visit	for	a	month	and	move	into	your	house	and	talk	to	the	babies	for	12	sessions	.
Here	's	what	it	looked	like	in	the	laboratory	.
Mandarin	Speaker	:	[	Mandarin	]	PK	:	So	what	have	we	done	to	their	little	brains	?
We	had	to	run	a	control	group	to	make	sure	that	just	coming	into	the	laboratory	did	n't	improve	your	Mandarin	skills	.
So	a	group	of	babies	came	in	and	listened	to	English	.
And	we	can	see	from	the	graph	that	exposure	to	English	did	n't	improve	their	Mandarin	.
But	look	at	what	happened	to	the	babies	exposed	to	Mandarin	for	12	sessions	.
They	were	as	good	as	the	babies	in	Taiwan	who	'd	been	listening	for	10-and-a-half	months	.
