It	can	be	a	very	complicated	thing	,	the	ocean	.
And	it	can	be	a	very	complicated	thing	,	what	human	health	is	.
And	bringing	those	two	together	might	seem	a	very	daunting	task	,
but	what	I	'm	going	to	try	to	say	is	that	even	in	that	complexity	,	there	's	some	simple	themes	that	I	think	,	if	we	understand	,	we	can	really	move	forward	.
And	those	simple	themes	are	n't	really	themes	about	the	complex	science	of	what	's	going	on	,	but	things	that	we	all	pretty	well	know	.
And	I	'm	going	to	start	with	this	one	:	If	momma	ai	n't	happy	,	ai	n't	nobody	happy	.
We	know	that	,	right	?	We	've	experienced	that	.
And	if	we	just	take	that	and	we	build	from	there	,	then	we	can	go	to	the	next	step	,	which	is	that	if	the	ocean	ai	n't	happy	,	ai	n't	nobody	happy	.
That	's	the	theme	of	my	talk	.
And	we	're	making	the	ocean	pretty	unhappy	in	a	lot	of	different	ways	.
This	is	a	shot	of	Cannery	Row	in	1932	.
Cannery	Row	,	at	the	time	,	had	the	biggest	industrial	canning	operation	on	the	west	coast	.
We	piled	enormous	amounts	of	pollution	into	the	air	and	into	the	water	.
Rolf	Bolin	,	who	was	a	professor	at	the	Hopkin	's	Marine	Station	where	I	work	,	wrote	in	the	1940s	that	``	The	fumes	from	the	scum	floating	on	the	inlets	of	the	bay	were	so	bad	they	turned	lead-based	paints	black	.	''
People	working	in	these	canneries	could	barely	stay	there	all	day	because	of	the	smell	,
but	you	know	what	they	came	out	saying	?
They	say	,	``	You	know	what	you	smell	?
You	smell	money	.	''
That	pollution	was	money	to	that	community	,
and	those	people	dealt	with	the	pollution	and	absorbed	it	into	their	skin	and	into	their	bodies	because	they	needed	the	money	.
We	made	the	ocean	unhappy	;	we	made	people	very	unhappy	,	and	we	made	them	unhealthy	.
The	connection	between	ocean	health	and	human	health	is	actually	based	upon	another	couple	simple	adages	,
and	I	want	to	call	that	``	pinch	a	minnow	,	hurt	a	whale	.	''
The	pyramid	of	ocean	life	...
Now	,	when	an	ecologist	looks	at	the	ocean	--	I	have	to	tell	you	--	we	look	at	the	ocean	in	a	very	different	way	,	and	we	see	different	things	than	when	a	regular	person	looks	at	the	ocean	because	when	an	ecologist	looks	at	the	ocean	,	we	see	all	those	interconnections	.
We	see	the	base	of	the	food	chain	,	the	plankton	,	the	small	things	,	and	we	see	how	those	animals	are	food	to	animals	in	the	middle	of	the	pyramid	,	and	on	so	up	this	diagram	.
And	that	flow	,	that	flow	of	life	,	from	the	very	base	up	to	the	very	top	,	is	the	flow	that	ecologists	see	.
And	that	's	what	we	're	trying	to	preserve
when	we	say	,	``	Save	the	ocean	.	Heal	the	ocean	.	''
It	's	that	pyramid	.
Now	why	does	that	matter	for	human	health	?
Because	when	we	jam	things	in	the	bottom	of	that	pyramid	that	should	n't	be	there	,	some	very	frightening	things	happen	.
Pollutants	,	some	pollutants	have	been	created	by	us	:	molecules	like	PCBs	that	ca	n't	be	broken	down	by	our	bodies	.
And	they	go	in	the	base	of	that	pyramid	,	and	they	drift	up	;	they	're	passed	up	that	way	,	on	to	predators	and	on	to	the	top	predators	,
and	in	so	doing	,	they	accumulate	.
Now	,	to	bring	that	home	,	I	thought	I	'd	invent	a	little	game	.
We	do	n't	really	have	to	play	it	;	we	can	just	think	about	it	here	.
It	's	the	Styrofoam	and	chocolate	game	.
Imagine	that	when	we	got	on	this	boat	,	we	were	all	given	two	Styrofoam	peanuts	.
Ca	n't	do	much	with	them	:	Put	them	in	your	pocket	.
Suppose	the	rules	are	:	every	time	you	offer	somebody	a	drink	,	you	give	them	the	drink	,	and	you	give	them	your	Styrofoam	peanuts	too	.
What	'll	happen	is	that	the	Styrofoam	peanuts	will	start	moving	through	our	society	here	,	and	they	will	accumulate	in	the	drunkest	,	stingiest	people	.
There	's	no	mechanism	in	this	game	for	them	to	go	anywhere	but	into	a	bigger	and	bigger	pile	of	indigestible	Styrofoam	peanuts	.
And	that	's	exactly	what	happens	with	PDBs	in	this	food	pyramid	:
They	accumulate	into	the	top	of	it	.
Now	suppose	,	instead	of	Styrofoam	peanuts	,	we	take	these	lovely	little	chocolates	that	we	get	and	we	had	those	instead	.
Well	,	some	of	us	would	be	eating	those	chocolates	instead	of	passing	them	around	,
and	instead	of	accumulating	,	they	will	just	pass	into	our	group	here	and	not	accumulate	in	any	one	group
because	they	're	absorbed	by	us	.
And	that	's	the	difference	between	a	PCB	and	,	say	,	something	natural	like	an	omega-3	,	something	we	want	out	of	the	marine	food	chain	.
PCBs	accumulate	.
We	have	great	examples	of	that	,	unfortunately	.
PCBs	accumulate	in	dolphins	in	Sarasota	Bay	,	in	Texas	,	in	North	Carolina	.
They	get	into	the	food	chain	.
The	dolphins	eat	the	fish	that	have	PCBs	from	the	plankton	,	and	those	PCBs	,	being	fat-soluble	,	accumulate	in	these	dolphins	.
Now	,	a	dolphin	,	mother	dolphin	,	any	dolphin	--	there	's	only	one	way	that	a	PCB	can	get	out	of	a	dolphin	.
And	what	's	that	?
In	mother	's	milk	.
Here	's	a	diagram	of	the	PCB	load	of	dolphins	in	Sarasota	Bay	.
Adult	males	:	a	huge	load	.
Juveniles	:	a	huge	load	.
Females	after	their	first	calf	is	already	weaned	:	a	lower	load	.
Those	females	,	they	're	not	trying	to	.
Those	females	are	passing	the	PCBs	in	the	fat	of	their	own	mother	's	milk	into	their	offspring	,
and	their	offspring	do	n't	survive	.
The	death	rate	in	these	dolphins	,	for	the	first	calf	born	of	every	female	dolphin	,	is	60	to	80	percent	.
These	mothers	pump	their	first	offspring	full	of	this	pollutant	,
and	most	of	them	die	.
Now	,	the	mother	then	can	go	and	reproduce	,	but	what	a	terrible	price	to	pay	for	the	accumulation	of	this	pollutant	in	these	animals	--	the	death	of	the	first-born	calf	.
There	's	another	top	predator	in	the	ocean	,	it	turns	out	.
That	top	predator	,	of	course	,	is	us	.
And	we	also	are	eating	meat	that	comes	from	some	of	these	same	places	.
This	is	whale	meat	that	I	photographed	in	a	grocery	store	in	Tokyo	--	or	is	it	?
In	fact	,	what	we	did	a	few	years	ago	was	learn	how	to	smuggle	a	molecular	biology	lab	into	Tokyo	and	use	it	to	genetically	test	the	DNA	out	of	whale	meat	samples	and	identify	what	they	really	were	.
And	some	of	those	whale	meat	samples	were	whale	meat	.
Some	of	them	were	illegal	whale	meat	,	by	the	way	.
That	's	another	story	.
But	some	of	them	were	not	whale	meat	at	all	.
Even	though	they	were	labeled	whale	meat	,	they	were	dolphin	meat	.
Some	of	them	were	dolphin	liver	.	Some	of	them	were	dolphin	blubber	.
And	those	dolphin	parts	had	a	huge	load	of	PCBs	,	dioxins	and	heavy	metals	.
And	that	huge	load	was	passing	into	the	people	that	ate	this	meat	.
It	turns	out	that	a	lot	of	dolphins	are	being	sold	as	meat	in	the	whale	meat	market	around	the	world	.
That	's	a	tragedy	for	those	populations	,
but	it	's	also	a	tragedy	for	the	people	eating	them	because	they	do	n't	know	that	that	's	toxic	meat	.
We	had	these	data	a	few	years	ago	.
I	remember	sitting	at	my	desk	being	about	the	only	person	in	the	world	who	knew	that	whale	meat	being	sold	in	these	markets	was	really	dolphin	meat	,	and	it	was	toxic	.
It	had	two-to-three-to-400	times	the	toxic	loads	ever	allowed	by	the	EPA	.
And	I	remember	there	sitting	at	my	desk	thinking	,	``	Well	,	I	know	this	.	This	is	a	great	scientific	discovery	,	''
but	it	was	so	awful	.
And	for	the	very	first	time	in	my	scientific	career	,	I	broke	scientific	protocol	,	which	is	that	you	take	the	data	and	publish	them	in	scientific	journals	and	then	begin	to	talk	about	them	.
We	sent	a	very	polite	letter	to	the	Minister	of	Health	in	Japan	and	simply	pointed	out	that	this	is	an	intolerable	situation	,	not	for	us	,	but	for	the	people	of	Japan
because	mothers	who	may	be	breastfeeding	,	who	may	have	young	children	,	would	be	buying	something	that	they	thought	was	healthy	,	but	it	was	really	toxic	.
That	led	to	a	whole	series	of	other	campaigns	in	Japan	,
and	I	'm	really	proud	to	say	that	at	this	point	,	it	's	very	difficult	to	buy	anything	in	Japan	that	's	labeled	incorrectly	,	even	though	they	're	still	selling	whale	meat	,	which	I	believe	they	should	n't	.
But	at	least	it	's	labeled	correctly	,
and	you	're	no	longer	going	to	be	buying	toxic	dolphin	meat	instead	.
It	is	n't	just	there	that	this	happens	,	but	in	a	natural	diet	of	some	communities	in	the	Canadian	arctic	and	in	the	United	States	and	in	the	European	arctic	,	a	natural	diet	of	seals	and	whales	leads	to	an	accumulation	of	PCBs	that	have	gathered	up	from	all	parts	of	the	world	and	ended	up	in	these	women	.
These	women	have	toxic	breast	milk	.
They	can	not	feed	their	offspring	,	their	children	,	their	breast	milk	because	of	the	accumulation	of	these	toxins	in	their	food	chain	,	in	their	part	of	the	world	's	ocean	pyramid	.
That	means	their	immune	systems	are	compromised	.
It	means	that	their	children	's	development	can	be	compromised	.
And	the	world	's	attention	on	this	over	the	last	decade	has	reduced	the	problem	for	these	women	,	not	by	changing	the	pyramid	,	but	by	changing	what	they	particularly	eat	out	of	it	.
We	've	taken	them	out	of	their	natural	pyramid	in	order	to	solve	this	problem	.
That	's	a	good	thing	for	this	particular	acute	problem	,	but	it	does	nothing	to	solve	the	pyramid	problem	.
There	's	other	ways	of	breaking	the	pyramid	.
The	pyramid	,	if	we	jam	things	in	the	bottom	,	can	get	backed	up	like	a	sewer	line	that	's	clogged	.
And	if	we	jam	nutrients	,	sewage	,	fertilizer	in	the	base	of	that	food	pyramid	,	it	can	back	up	all	through	it	.
We	end	up	with	things	we	've	heard	about	before	:	red	tides	,	for	example	,	which	are	blooms	of	toxic	algae	floating	through	the	oceans	causing	neurological	damage	.
We	can	also	see	blooms	of	bacteria	,	blooms	of	viruses	in	the	ocean	.
These	are	two	shots	of	a	red	tide	coming	on	shore	here	and	a	bacteria	in	the	genus	vibrio	,	which	includes	the	genus	that	has	cholera	in	it	.
How	many	people	have	seen	a	``	beach	closed	''	sign	?
Why	does	that	happen	?
It	happens	because	we	have	jammed	so	much	into	the	base	of	the	natural	ocean	pyramid	that	these	bacteria	clog	it	up	and	overfill	onto	our	beaches	.
Often	what	jams	us	up	is	sewage	.
Now	how	many	of	you	have	ever	gone	to	a	state	park	or	a	national	park	where	you	had	a	big	sign	at	the	front	saying	,	``	Closed	because	human	sewage	is	so	far	over	this	park	that	you	ca	n't	use	it	''	?
Not	very	often	.	We	would	n't	tolerate	that	.
We	would	n't	tolerate	our	parks	being	swamped	by	human	sewage	,
but	beaches	are	closed	a	lot	in	our	country	.	They	're	closed	more	and	more	and	more	all	around	the	world	for	the	same	reason	,
and	I	believe	we	should	n't	tolerate	that	either	.
It	's	not	just	a	question	of	cleanliness	;
it	's	also	a	question	of	how	those	organisms	then	turn	into	human	disease	.
These	vibrios	,	these	bacteria	,	can	actually	infect	people	.
They	can	go	into	your	skin	and	create	skin	infections	.
This	is	a	graph	from	NOAA	's	ocean	and	human	health	initiative	,	showing	the	rise	of	the	infections	by	vibrio	in	people	over	the	last	few	years	.
Surfers	,	for	example	,	know	this	incredibly	.
And	if	you	can	see	on	some	surfing	sites	,	in	fact	,	not	only	do	you	see	what	the	waves	are	like	or	what	the	weather	's	like	,	but	on	some	surf	rider	sites	,	you	see	a	little	flashing	poo	alert	.
That	means	that	the	beach	might	have	great	waves	,	but	it	's	a	dangerous	place	for	surfers	to	be	because	they	can	carry	with	them	,	even	after	a	great	day	of	surfing	,	this	legacy	of	an	infection	that	might	take	a	very	long	time	to	solve	.
Some	of	these	infections	are	actually	carrying	antibiotic	resistance	genes	now	,
and	that	makes	them	even	more	difficult	.
These	same	infections	create	harmful	algal	blooms	.
Those	blooms	are	generating	other	kinds	of	chemicals	.
This	is	just	a	simple	list	of	some	of	the	types	of	poisons	that	come	out	of	these	harmful	algal	blooms	:	shellfish	poisoning	,	fish	ciguatera	,	diarrheic	shellfish	poisoning	--	you	do	n't	want	to	know	about	that	--	neurotoxic	shellfish	poisoning	,	paralytic	shellfish	poisoning	.
These	are	things	that	are	getting	into	our	food	chain	because	of	these	blooms	.
Rita	Calwell	very	famously	traced	a	very	interesting	story	of	cholera	into	human	communities	,	brought	there	,	not	by	a	normal	human	vector	,	but	by	a	marine	vector	,	this	copepod	.
Copepods	are	small	crustaceans	.
They	're	a	tiny	fraction	of	an	inch	long	,
and	they	can	carry	on	their	little	legs	some	of	the	cholera	bacteria	that	then	leads	to	human	disease	.
That	has	sparked	cholera	epidemics	in	ports	along	the	world	and	has	led	to	increased	concentration	on	trying	to	make	sure	shipping	does	n't	move	these	vectors	of	cholera	around	the	world	.
So	what	do	you	do	?
We	have	major	problems	in	disrupted	ecosystem	flow	that	the	pyramid	may	not	be	working	so	well	,	that	the	flow	from	the	base	up	into	it	is	being	blocked	and	clogged	.
What	do	you	do	when	you	have	this	sort	of	disrupted	flow	?
Well	,	there	's	a	bunch	of	things	you	could	do	.
You	could	call	Joe	the	Plumber	,	for	example	.
And	he	could	come	in	and	fix	the	flow	.
But	in	fact	,	if	you	look	around	the	world	,	not	only	are	there	hope	spots	for	where	we	may	be	able	to	fix	problems	,	there	have	been	places	where	problems	have	been	fixed	,	where	people	have	come	to	grips	with	these	issues	and	begun	to	turn	them	around	.
Monterey	is	one	of	those	.
I	started	out	showing	how	much	we	had	distressed	the	Monterey	Bay	ecosystem	with	pollution	and	the	canning	industry	and	all	of	the	attendant	problems	.
In	1932	,	that	's	the	picture	.
In	2009	,	the	picture	is	dramatically	different	.
The	canneries	are	gone	.	The	pollution	has	abated	.
But	there	's	a	greater	sense	here	that	what	the	individual	communities	need	is	working	ecosystems	.
They	need	a	functioning	pyramid	from	the	base	all	the	way	to	the	top	.
And	that	pyramid	in	Monterey	,	right	now	,	because	of	the	efforts	of	a	lot	of	different	people	,	is	functioning	better	than	it	's	ever	functioned	for	the	last	150	years	.
It	did	n't	happen	accidentally	.
It	happened	because	many	people	put	their	time	and	effort	and	their	pioneering	spirit	into	this	.
On	the	left	there	,	Julia	Platt	,	the	mayor	of	my	little	hometown	in	Pacific	Grove	.
At	74	years	old	,	became	mayor	because	something	had	to	be	done	to	protect	the	ocean	.
In	1931	,	she	produced	California	's	first	community-based	marine	protected	area	,	right	next	to	the	biggest	polluting	cannery	,	because	Julia	knew	that	when	the	canneries	eventually	were	gone	,	the	ocean	needed	a	place	to	grow	from	,	that	the	ocean	needed	a	place	to	spark	a	seed	,
and	she	wanted	to	provide	that	seed	.
Other	people	,	like	David	Packard	and	Julie	Packard	,	who	were	instrumental	in	producing	the	Monterey	Bay	aquarium	to	lock	into	people	's	notion	that	the	ocean	and	the	health	of	the	ocean	ecosystem	were	just	as	important	to	the	economy	of	this	area	as	eating	the	ecosystem	would	be	.
That	change	in	thinking	has	led	to	a	dramatic	shift	,	not	only	in	the	fortunes	of	Monterey	Bay	,	but	other	places	around	the	world	.
Well	,	I	want	to	leave	you	with	the	thought	that	what	we	're	really	trying	to	do	here	is	protect	this	ocean	pyramid	,
and	that	ocean	pyramid	connects	to	our	own	pyramid	of	life	.
It	's	an	ocean	planet	,	and	we	think	of	ourselves	as	a	terrestrial	species	,
but	the	pyramid	of	life	in	the	ocean	and	our	own	lives	on	land	are	intricately	connected	.
And	it	's	only	through	having	the	ocean	being	healthy	that	we	can	remain	healthy	ourselves	.
Thank	you	very	much	.
Let	's	start	with	day	and	night	.
Life	evolved	under	conditions	of	light	and	darkness	,	light	and	then	darkness	.
And	so	plants	and	animals	developed	their	own	internal	clocks	so	that	they	would	be	ready	for	these	changes	in	light	.
These	are	chemical	clocks	,	and	they	're	found	in	every	known	being	that	has	two	or	more	cells	and	in	some	that	only	have	one	cell	.
I	'll	give	you	an	example	--
if	you	take	a	horseshoe	crab	off	the	beach	,	and	you	fly	it	all	the	way	across	the	continent	,	and	you	drop	it	into	a	sloped	cage	,	it	will	scramble	up	the	floor	of	the	cage	as	the	tide	is	rising	on	its	home	shores	,	and	it	'll	skitter	down	again	right	as	the	water	is	receding	thousands	of	miles	away	.
It	'll	do	this	for	weeks	,	until	it	kind	of	gradually	loses	the	plot	.
And	it	's	incredible	to	watch	,	but	there	's	nothing	psychic	or	paranormal	going	on	;	it	's	simply	that	these	crabs	have	internal	cycles	that	correspond	,	usually	,	with	what	's	going	on	around	it	.
So	,	we	have	this	ability	as	well	.
And	in	humans	,	we	call	it	the	``	body	clock	.	''
You	can	see	this	most	clearly	when	you	take	away	someone	's	watch	and	you	shut	them	into	a	bunker	,	deep	underground	,	for	a	couple	of	months	.
People	actually	volunteer	for	this	,	and	they	usually	come	out	kind	of	raving	about	their	productive	time	in	the	hole	.
So	,	no	matter	how	atypical	these	subjects	would	have	to	be	,	they	all	show	the	same	thing	.
They	get	up	just	a	little	bit	later	every	day	--	say	15	minutes	or	so	--	and	they	kind	of	drift	all	the	way	around	the	clock	like	this	over	the	course	of	the	weeks	.
And	so	,	in	this	way	we	know	that	they	are	working	on	their	own	internal	clocks	,	rather	than	somehow	sensing	the	day	outside	.
So	fine	,	we	have	a	body	clock	,	and	it	turns	out	that	it	's	incredibly	important	in	our	lives	.
It	's	a	huge	driver	for	culture	and	I	think	that	it	's	the	most	underrated	force	on	our	behavior	.
We	evolved	as	a	species	near	the	equator	,	and	so	we	're	very	well-equipped	to	deal	with	12	hours	of	daylight	and	12	hours	of	darkness	.
But	of	course	,	we	've	spread	to	every	corner	of	the	globe	and	in	Arctic	Canada	,	where	I	live	,	we	have	perpetual	daylight	in	summer	and	24	hours	of	darkness	in	winter	.
So	the	culture	,	the	northern	aboriginal	culture	,	traditionally	has	been	highly	seasonal	.
In	winter	,	there	's	a	lot	of	sleeping	going	on	;
you	enjoy	your	family	life	inside	.
And	in	summer	,	it	's	almost	manic	hunting	and	working	activity	very	long	hours	,	very	active	.
So	,	what	would	our	natural	rhythm	look	like	?
What	would	our	sleeping	patterns	be	in	the	sort	of	ideal	sense	?
Well	,	it	turns	out	that	when	people	are	living	without	any	sort	of	artificial	light	at	all	,	they	sleep	twice	every	night	.
They	go	to	bed	around	8:00	p.m	.
until	midnight	and	then	again	,	they	sleep	from	about	2:00	a.m.	until	sunrise	.
And	in-between	,	they	have	a	couple	of	hours	of	sort	of	meditative	quiet	in	bed	.
And	during	this	time	,	there	's	a	surge	of	prolactin	,	the	likes	of	which	a	modern	day	never	sees	.
The	people	in	these	studies	report	feeling	so	awake	during	the	daytime	,	that	they	realize	they	're	experiencing	true	wakefulness	for	the	first	time	in	their	lives	.
So	,	cut	to	the	modern	day	.
We	're	living	in	a	culture	of	jet	lag	,	global	travel	,	24-hour	business	,	shift	work	.
And	you	know	,	our	modern	ways	of	doing	things	have	their	advantages	,	but	I	believe	we	should	understand	the	costs	.
Thank	you	.
Adrian	Kohler	:	Well	,	we	're	here	today	to	talk	about	the	evolution	of	a	puppet	horse	.
Basil	Jones	:	But	actually	we	're	going	to	start	this	evolution	with	a	hyena	.
AK	:	The	ancestor	of	the	horse	.
Okay	,	we	'll	do	something	with	it	.
Hahahaha	.
The	hyena	is	the	ancestor	of	the	horse	because	it	was	part	of	a	production	called	``	Faustus	in	Africa	,	''	a	Handspring	Production	from	1995	,	where	it	had	to	play	draughts	with	Helen	of	Troy	.
This	production	was	directed	by	South	African	artist	and	theater	director	,	William	Kentridge	.
So	it	needed	a	very	articulate	front	paw	.
But	,	like	all	puppets	,	it	has	other	attributes	.
BJ	:	One	of	them	is	breath	,	and	it	kind	of	breathes	.
AK	:	Haa	haa	haaa	.
BJ	:	Breath	is	really	important	for	us	.
It	's	the	kind	of	original	movement	for	any	puppet	for	us	onstage	.
It	's	the	thing	that	distinguishes	the	puppet	--	AK	:	Oops	.
BJ	:	From	an	actor	.
Puppets	always	have	to	try	to	be	alive	.
It	's	their	kind	of	ur-story	onstage	,	that	desperation	to	live	.
AK	:	Yeah	,	it	's	basically	a	dead	object	,	as	you	can	see	,	and	it	only	lives	because	you	make	it	.
An	actor	struggles	to	die	onstage	,	but	a	puppet	has	to	struggle	to	live	.
And	in	a	way	that	's	a	metaphor	for	life	.
BJ	:	So	every	moment	it	's	on	the	stage	,	it	's	making	the	struggle	.
So	we	call	this	a	piece	of	emotional	engineering	that	uses	up-to-the-minute	17th	century	technology	--	to	turn	nouns	into	verbs	.
AK	:	Well	actually	I	prefer	to	say	that	it	's	an	object	constructed	out	of	wood	and	cloth	with	movement	built	into	it	to	persuade	you	to	believe	that	it	has	life	.
BJ	:	Okay	so	.
AK	:	It	has	ears	that	move	passively	when	the	head	goes	.
BJ	:	And	it	has	these	bulkheads	made	out	of	plywood	,	covered	with	fabric	--	curiously	similar	,	in	fact	,	to	the	plywood	canoes	that	Adrian	's	father	used	to	make	when	he	was	a	boy	in	their	workshop	.	AK	:	In	Port	Elizabeth	,	the	village	outside	Port	Elizabeth	in	South	Africa	.
BJ	:	His	mother	was	a	puppeteer	.
And	when	we	met	at	art	school	and	fell	in	love	in	1971	,	I	hated	puppets	.
I	really	thought	they	were	so	beneath	me	.
I	wanted	to	become	an	avant-garde	artist	--	and	Punch	and	Judy	was	certainly	not	where	I	wanted	to	go	.	And	,	in	fact	,	it	took	about	10	years
to	discover	the	Bambara	Bamana	puppets	of	Mali	in	West	Africa	,	where	there	's	a	fabulous	tradition	of	puppetry	,	to	learn	a	renewed	,	or	a	new	,	respect	for	this	art	form	.
AK	:	So	in	1981	,	I	persuaded	Basil	and	some	friends	of	mine	to	form	a	puppet	company	.
And	20	years	later	,	miraculously	,	we	collaborated	with	a	company	from	Mali	,	the	Sogolon	Marionette	Troupe	of	Bamako	,	where	we	made	a	piece	about	a	tall	giraffe	.
It	was	just	called	``	Tall	Horse	,	''	which	was	a	life-sized	giraffe	.
BJ	:	And	here	again	,	you	see	the	same	structure	.
The	bulkheads	have	now	turned	into	hoops	of	cane	,	but	it	's	ultimately	the	same	structure	.
It	's	got	two	people	inside	it	on	stilts	,	which	give	them	the	height	,	and	somebody	in	the	front	who	's	using	a	kind	of	steering	wheel	to	move	that	head	.
AK	:	The	person	in	the	hind	legs	is	also	controlling	the	tail	,	a	bit	like	the	hyena	--	same	mechanism	,	just	a	bit	bigger	.
And	he	's	controlling	the	ear	movement	.
BJ	:	So	this	production	was	seen	by	Tom	Morris	of	the	National	Theatre	in	London	.
And	just	around	that	time	,	his	mother	had	said	,	``	Have	you	seen	this	book	by	Michael	Morpurgo	called	'War	Horse	'	?	''
AK	:	It	's	about	a	boy	who	falls	in	love	with	a	horse	.
The	horse	is	sold	to	the	First	World	War	,	and	he	joins	up	to	find	his	horse	.
BJ	:	So	Tom	gave	us	a	call	and	said	,	``	Do	you	think	you	could	make	us	a	horse	for	a	show	to	happen	at	the	National	Theatre	?	''
AK	:	It	seemed	a	lovely	idea	.
BJ	:	But	it	had	to	ride	.	It	had	to	have	a	rider	.
AK	:	It	had	to	have	a	rider	,	and	it	had	to	participate	in	cavalry	charges	.
A	play	about	early	20th	century	plowing	technology	and	cavalry	charges	was	a	little	bit	of	a	challenge	for	the	accounting	department	at	the	National	Theatre	in	London	.
But	they	agreed	to	go	along	with	it	for	a	while	.
So	we	began	with	a	test	.
BJ	:	This	is	Adrian	and	Thys	Stander	,	who	went	on	to	actually	design	the	cane	system	for	the	horse	,	and	our	next-door	neighbor	Katherine	,	riding	on	a	ladder	.
The	weight	is	really	difficult	when	it	's	up	above	your	head	.
AK	:	And	once	we	put	Katherine	through	that	particular	brand	of	hell	,	we	knew	that	we	might	be	able	to	make	a	horse	,	which	could	be	ridden	.
So	we	made	a	model	.
This	is	a	cardboard	model	,	a	little	bit	smaller	than	the	hyena	.
You	'll	notice	that	the	legs	are	plywood	legs	and	the	canoe	structure	is	still	there	.
BJ	:	And	the	two	manipulators	are	inside	.
But	we	did	n't	realize	at	the	time	that	we	actually	needed	a	third	manipulator	,	because	we	could	n't	manipulate	the	neck	from	inside	and	walk	the	horse	at	the	same	time	.
AK	:	We	started	work	on	the	prototype	after	the	model	was	approved	,	and	the	prototype	took	a	bit	longer	than	we	anticipated	.
We	had	to	throw	out	the	plywood	legs	and	make	new	cane	ones	.
And	we	had	a	crate	built	for	it	.
It	had	to	be	shipped	to	London	.
We	were	going	to	test-drive	it	on	the	street	outside	of	our	house	in	Cape	Town	,	and	it	got	to	midnight	and	we	had	n't	done	that	yet	.
BJ	:	So	we	got	a	camera	,	and	we	posed	the	puppet	in	various	galloping	stances	.
And	we	sent	it	off	to	the	National	Theatre	,	hoping	that	they	believed	that	we	created	something	that	worked	.
AK	:	A	month	later	,	we	were	there	in	London	with	this	big	box	and	a	studio	full	of	people	about	to	work	with	us	.
BJ	:	About	40	people	.
AK	:	We	were	terrified	.
We	opened	the	lid	,	we	took	the	horse	out	,	and	it	did	work	;	it	walked	and	it	was	able	to	be	ridden	.
Here	I	have	an	18-second	clip	of	the	very	first	walk	of	the	prototype	.
This	is	in	the	National	Theatre	studio	,	the	place	where	they	cook	new	ideas	.
It	had	by	no	means	got	the	green	light	yet	.
The	choreographer	,	Toby	Sedgwick	,	invented	a	beautiful	sequence	where	the	baby	horse	,	which	was	made	out	of	sticks	and	bits	of	twigs	,	grew	up	into	the	big	horse	.
And	Nick	Starr	,	the	director	of	the	National	Theatre	,	saw	that	particular	moment	,	he	was	standing	next	to	me	--	he	nearly	wet	himself	.
And	so	the	show	was	given	the	green	light	.
And	we	went	back	to	Cape	Town	and	redesigned	the	horse	completely	.
Here	is	the	plan	.
And	here	is	our	factory	in	Cape	Town	where	we	make	horses	.
You	can	see	quite	a	lot	of	skeletons	in	the	background	there	.
The	horses	are	completely	handmade	.
There	is	very	little	20th	century	technology	in	them	.
We	used	a	bit	of	laser	cutting	on	the	plywood	and	some	of	the	aluminum	pieces	.
But	because	they	have	to	be	light	and	flexible	,	and	each	one	of	them	is	different	,	they	ca	n't	be	mass-produced	,	unfortunately	.
So	here	are	some	half-finished	horses	ready	to	be	worked	in	London	.
And	now	we	would	like	to	introduce	you	to	Joey	.
Joey	boy	,	you	there	?
Joey	.
Joey	.
Joey	,	come	here	.
No	,	no	,	I	have	n't	got	it	.
He	's	got	it	;	it	's	in	his	pocket	.
BJ	:	Joey	.
AK	:	Joey	,	Joey	,	Joey	,	Joey	.
Come	here	.	Stand	here	where	people	can	see	you	.
Move	around	.	Come	on	.
I	'd	just	like	to	describe	--	I	wo	n't	talk	too	loud	.	He	might	get	irritated	.
Here	,	Craig	is	working	the	head	.
He	has	bicycle	brake	cables	going	down	to	the	head	control	in	his	hand	.
Each	one	of	them	operates	either	an	ear	,	separately	,	or	the	head	,	up	and	down	.
But	he	also	controls	the	head	directly	by	using	his	hand	.
The	ears	are	obviously	a	very	important	emotional	indicator	of	the	horse	.
When	they	point	right	back	,	the	horse	is	fearful	or	angry	,	depending	upon	what	's	going	on	in	front	of	him	,	around	him	.
Or	,	when	he	's	more	relaxed	,	the	head	comes	down	and	the	ears	listen	,	either	side	.
Horses	'	hearing	is	very	important	.
It	's	almost	more	important	than	their	eyesight	.
Over	here	,	Tommy	's	got	what	you	call	the	heart	position	.
He	's	working	the	leg	.
You	see	the	string	tendon	from	the	hyena	,	the	hyena	's	front	leg	,	automatically	pulls	the	hoop	up	.
Horses	are	so	unpredictable	.
The	way	a	hoof	comes	up	with	a	horse	immediately	gives	you	the	feeling	that	it	's	a	convincing	horse	action	.
The	hind	legs	have	got	the	same	action	.
BJ	:	And	Mikey	also	has	,	in	his	fingers	,	the	ability	to	move	the	tail	from	left	to	right	,	and	up	and	down	with	the	other	hand	.
And	together	,	there	's	quite	a	complex	possibility	of	tail	expression	.
AK	:	You	want	to	say	something	about	the	breathing	?
BJ	:	We	had	a	big	challenge	with	breathing	.
Adrian	thought	that	he	was	going	to	have	to	split	the	chest	of	the	puppet	in	two	and	make	it	breathe	like	that	--	because	that	's	how	a	horse	would	breathe	,	with	an	expanded	chest	.
But	we	realized	that	,	if	that	were	to	be	happening	,	you	would	n't	,	as	an	audience	,	see	the	breath	.
So	he	made	a	channel	in	here	,	and	the	chest	moves	up	and	down	in	that	channel	.
So	it	's	anti-naturalistic	really	,	the	up	and	down	movement	,	but	it	feels	like	breath	.
And	it	's	very	,	very	simple	because	all	that	happens	is	that	the	puppeteer	breathes	with	his	knees	.
AK	:	Other	emotional	stuff	.
If	I	were	to	touch	the	horse	here	on	his	skin	,	the	heart	puppeteer	can	shake	the	body	from	inside	and	get	the	skin	to	quiver	.
You	'll	notice	,	of	course	,	that	the	puppet	is	made	out	of	cane	lines	.
And	I	would	like	you	to	believe	that	it	was	an	aesthetic	choice	,	that	I	was	making	a	three-dimensional	drawing	of	a	horse	that	somehow	moves	in	space	.
But	of	course	,	it	was	the	cane	is	light	,	the	cane	is	flexible	,	the	cane	is	durable	and	the	cane	is	moldable	.
And	so	it	was	a	very	practical	reason	why	it	was	made	of	cane	.
The	skin	itself	is	made	out	of	a	see-through	nylon	mesh	,	which	,	if	the	lighting	designer	wants	the	horse	to	almost	disappear	,	she	can	light	the	background	and	the	horse	becomes	ghostlike	.
You	see	the	skeletal	structure	of	it	.
Or	if	you	light	it	from	above	,	it	becomes	more	solid	.
Again	,	that	was	a	practical	consideration	.
The	guys	inside	the	horse	have	to	be	able	to	see	out	.
They	have	to	be	able	to	act	along	with	their	fellow	actors	in	the	production	.	And	it	's	very	much	an	in-the-moment	activity	that	they	're	engaged	in	.
It	's	three	heads	making	one	character	.
But	now	we	would	like	you	to	put	Joey	through	some	paces	.
And	plant	.
Thank	you	.
And	now	just	--	All	the	way	from	sunny	California	we	have	Zem	Joaquin	who	's	going	to	ride	the	horse	for	us	.	So	we	would	like	to	stress	that	the	performance	you	see	in	the	horse	is	three	guys	who	have	studied	horse	behavior	incredibly	thoroughly	.
BJ	:	Not	being	able	to	talk	to	one	another	while	they	're	onstage	because	they	're	mic	'd	.
The	sound	that	that	very	large	chest	makes	,	of	the	horse	--	the	whinnying	and	the	nickering	and	everything	--	that	starts	usually	with	one	performer	,	carries	on	with	a	second	person	and	ends	with	a	third	.
AK	:	Mikey	Brett	from	Leicestershire	.
Mikey	Brett	,	Craig	,	Leo	,	Zem	Joaquin	and	Basil	and	me	.
Thank	you	.	Thank	you	.
I	want	to	help	you	re-perceive	what	philanthropy	is	,	what	it	could	be	,	and	what	your	relationship	to	it	is	.
And	in	doing	that	,	I	want	to	offer	you	a	vision	,	an	imagined	future	,	if	you	will	,	of	how	,	as	the	poet	Seamus	Heaney	has	put	it	,	``	Once	in	a	lifetime	the	longed-for	tidal	wave	of	justice	can	rise	up	,	and	hope	and	history	rhyme	.	''
I	want	to	start	with	these	word	pairs	here	.
We	all	know	which	side	of	these	we	'd	like	to	be	on	.
When	philanthropy	was	reinvented	a	century	ago	,	when	the	foundation	form	was	actually	invented	,	they	did	n't	think	of	themselves	on	the	wrong	side	of	these	either	.
In	fact	they	would	never	have	thought	of	themselves	as	closed	and	set	in	their	ways	,	as	slow	to	respond	to	new	challenges	,	as	small	and	risk-averse	.
And	in	fact	they	were	n't	.	They	were	reinventing	charity	in	those	times	,
what	Rockefeller	called	``	the	business	of	benevolence	.	''
But	by	the	end	of	the	20th	century	,	a	new	generation	of	critics	and	reformers	had	come	to	see	philanthropy	just	this	way	.
The	thing	to	watch	for	as	a	global	philanthropy	industry	comes	about	--	and	that	's	exactly	what	is	happening	--	is	how	the	aspiration	is	to	flip	these	old	assumptions	,
for	philanthropy	to	become	open	and	big	and	fast	and	connected	,	in	service	of	the	long	term	.
This	entrepreneurial	energy	is	emerging	from	many	quarters	.
And	it	's	driven	and	propelled	forward	by	new	leaders	,	like	many	of	the	people	here	,	by	new	tools	,	like	the	ones	we	've	seen	here	,	and	by	new	pressures	.
I	've	been	following	this	change	for	quite	a	while	now	,	and	participating	in	it	.
This	report	is	our	main	public	report	.
What	it	tells	is	the	story	of	how	today	actually	could	be	as	historic	as	100	years	ago	.
What	I	want	to	do	is	share	some	of	the	coolest	things	that	are	going	on	with	you	.
And	as	I	do	that	,	I	'm	not	going	to	dwell	much	on	the	very	large	philanthropy	that	everybody	already	knows	about	--	the	Gates	or	the	Soros	or	the	Google	.
Instead	,	what	I	want	to	do	is	talk	about	the	philanthropy	of	all	of	us	:
the	democratization	of	philanthropy	.
This	is	a	moment	in	history	when	the	average	person	has	more	power	than	at	any	time	.
What	I	'm	going	to	do	is	look	at	five	categories	of	experiments	,	each	of	which	challenges	an	old	assumption	of	philanthropy	.
The	first	is	mass	collaboration	,	represented	here	by	Wikipedia	.
Now	,	this	may	surprise	you	.
But	remember	,	philanthropy	is	about	giving	of	time	and	talent	,	not	just	money	.
Clay	Shirky	,	that	great	chronicler	of	everything	networked	,	has	captured	the	assumption	that	this	challenges	in	such	a	beautiful	way	.
He	said	,	``	We	have	lived	in	this	world	where	little	things	are	done	for	love	and	big	things	for	money	.
Now	we	have	Wikipedia	.
Suddenly	big	things	can	be	done	for	love	.	''	Watch	,	this	spring	,	for	Paul	Hawken	's	new	book	--
Author	and	entrepreneur	many	of	you	may	know	about	.
The	book	is	called	``	Blessed	Unrest	.	''
And	when	it	comes	out	,	a	series	of	wiki	sites	under	the	label	WISER	,	are	going	to	launch	at	the	same	time	.
WISER	stands	for	World	Index	for	Social	and	Environmental	Responsibility	.
WISER	sets	out	to	document	,	link	and	empower	what	Paul	calls	the	largest	movement	,	and	fastest-growing	movement	in	human	history	:
humanity	's	collective	immune	response	to	today	's	threats	.
Now	,	all	of	these	big	things	for	love	--	experiments	--	are	n't	going	to	take	off	.
But	the	ones	that	do	are	going	to	be	the	biggest	,	the	most	open	,	the	fastest	,	the	most	connected	form	of	philanthropy	in	human	history	.
Second	category	is	online	philanthropy	marketplaces	.
This	is	,	of	course	,	to	philanthropy	what	eBay	and	Amazon	are	to	commerce	.
Think	of	it	as	peer-to-peer	philanthropy	.
And	this	challenges	yet	another	assumption	,	which	is	that	organized	philanthropy	is	only	for	the	very	wealthy	.
Take	a	look	,	if	you	have	n't	,	at	DonorsChoose	.
Omidyar	Network	has	made	a	big	investment	in	DonorsChoose	.
It	's	one	of	the	best	known	of	these	new	marketplaces	where	a	donor	can	go	straight	into	a	classroom	and	connect	with	what	a	teacher	says	they	need	.
Take	a	look	at	Changing	the	Present	,	started	by	a	TEDster	,	next	time	you	need	a	wedding	present	or	a	holiday	present	.
GiveIndia	is	for	a	whole	country	.
And	it	goes	on	and	on	.
The	third	category	is	represented	by	Warren	Buffet	,
which	I	call	aggregated	giving	.
It	's	not	just	that	Warren	Buffet	was	so	amazingly	generous	in	that	historic	act	last	summer	.
It	's	that	he	challenged	another	assumption	,	that	every	giver	should	have	his	or	her	own	fund	or	foundation	.
There	are	now	,	today	,	so	many	new	funds	that	are	aggregating	giving	and	investing	,	bringing	together	people	around	a	common	goal	,	to	think	bigger	.
One	of	the	best	known	is	Acumen	Fund	,	led	by	Jacqueline	Novogratz	,	a	TEDster	who	got	a	big	boost	here	at	TED	.
But	there	are	many	others	:	New	Profit	in	Cambridge	,	New	School	's	Venture	Fund	in	Silicon	Valley	,	Venture	Philanthropy	Partners	in	Washington	,	Global	Fund	for	Women	in	San	Francisco	.
Take	a	look	at	these	.
These	funds	are	to	philanthropy	what	venture	capital	,	private	equity	,	and	eventually	mutual	funds	are	to	investing	,
but	with	a	twist	--	because	often	a	community	forms	around	these	funds	,	as	it	has	at	Acumen	and	other	places	.
Now	,	imagine	for	a	second	these	first	three	types	of	experiments	:	mass	collaboration	,	online	marketplaces	,	aggregated	giving	.
And	understand	how	they	help	us	re-perceive	what	organized	philanthropy	is	.
It	's	not	about	foundations	necessarily	;	it	's	about	the	rest	of	us	.
And	imagine	the	mash-up	,	if	you	will	,	of	these	things	,	in	the	future	,	when	these	things	come	together	in	the	experiments	of	the	future	--	imagine	that	somebody	puts	up	,	say	,	100	million	dollars	for	an	inspiring	goal	--	there	were	21	gifts	of	100	million	dollars	or	more	in	the	US	last	year	,	not	out	of	the	question	--	but	only	puts	it	up	if	it	's	matched	by	millions	of	small	gifts	from	around	the	globe	,
thereby	engaging	lots	of	people	,	and	building	visibility	and	engaging	people	in	the	goal	that	's	stated	.
I	'm	going	to	look	quickly	at	the	fourth	and	fifth	categories	,	which	are	innovation	,	competitions	and	social	investing	.
They	're	betting	a	visible	competition	,	a	prize	,	can	attract	talent	and	money	to	some	of	the	most	difficult	issues	,	and	thereby	speed	the	solution	.
This	tackles	yet	another	assumption	,	that	the	giver	and	the	organization	is	at	the	center	,	as	opposed	to	putting	the	problem	at	the	center	.
You	can	look	to	these	innovators	to	help	us	especially	with	things	that	require	technological	or	scientific	solution	.
That	leaves	the	final	category	,	social	investing	,	which	is	really	,	anyway	,	the	biggest	of	them	all	,
represented	here	by	Xigi.net	.
And	this	,	of	course	,	tackles	the	biggest	assumption	of	all	,	that	business	is	business	,	and	philanthropy	is	the	vehicle	of	people	who	want	to	create	change	in	the	world	.
Xigi	is	a	new	community	site	that	's	built	by	the	community	,	linking	and	mapping	this	new	social	capital	market	.
It	lists	already	1,000	entities	that	are	offering	debt	and	equity	for	social	enterprise	.
So	we	can	look	to	these	innovators	to	help	us	remember	that	if	we	can	leverage	even	a	small	amount	of	the	capital	that	seeks	a	return	,	the	good	that	can	be	driven	could	be	astonishing	.
Now	,	what	's	really	interesting	here	is	that	we	're	not	thinking	our	way	into	a	new	way	of	acting	;
we	're	acting	our	way	into	a	new	way	of	thinking	.
Philanthropy	is	reorganizing	itself	before	our	very	eyes	.
And	even	though	all	of	the	experiments	and	all	of	the	big	givers	do	n't	yet	fulfill	this	aspiration	,	I	think	this	is	the	new	zeitgeist	:	open	,	big	,	fast	,	connected	,
and	,	let	us	also	hope	,	long	.
We	have	got	to	realize	that	it	is	going	to	take	a	long	time	to	do	these	things	.
If	we	do	n't	develop	the	stamina	to	stick	with	things	--	whatever	it	is	you	pick	,	stick	with	it	--	all	of	this	stuff	is	just	going	to	be	,	you	know	,	a	fad	.
But	I	'm	really	hopeful	.
And	I	'm	hopeful	because	it	's	not	only	philanthropy	that	's	reorganizing	itself	,
it	's	also	whole	other	portions	of	the	social	sector	,	and	of	business	,	that	are	busy	challenging	``	business	as	usual	.	''
And	everywhere	I	go	,	including	here	at	TED	,	I	feel	that	there	is	a	new	moral	hunger	that	is	growing	.	What	we	're	seeing	is	people	really	wrestling	to	describe	what	is	this	new	thing	that	's	happening	.
Words	like	``	philanthrocapitalism	,	''	and	``	natural	capitalism	,	''	and	``	philanthroentrepreneur	,	''	and	``	venture	philanthropy	.	''
We	do	n't	have	a	language	for	it	yet	.
Whatever	we	call	it	,	it	's	new	,	it	's	beginning	,	and	I	think	it	's	gong	to	quite	significant	.
And	that	's	where	my	imagined	future	comes	in	,
which	I	am	going	to	call	the	social	singularity	.
Many	of	you	will	realize	that	I	'm	ripping	a	bit	off	of	the	science	fiction	writer	Vernor	Vinge	's	notion	of	a	technological	singularity	,	where	a	number	of	trends	accelerate	and	converge	and	come	together	to	create	,	really	,	a	shockingly	new	reality	.
It	may	be	that	the	social	singularity	ahead	is	the	one	that	we	fear	the	most	:
a	convergence	of	catastrophes	,	of	environmental	degradation	,	of	weapons	of	mass	destruction	,	of	pandemics	,	of	poverty	.
That	's	because	our	ability	to	confront	the	problems	that	we	face	has	not	kept	pace	with	our	ability	to	create	them	.
And	as	we	've	heard	here	,	it	is	no	exaggeration	to	say	that	we	hold	the	future	of	our	civilization	in	our	hands	as	never	before	.
The	question	is	,	is	there	a	positive	social	singularity	?
Is	there	a	frontier	for	us	of	how	we	live	together	?
Our	future	does	n't	have	to	be	imagined	.
We	can	create	a	future	where	hope	and	history	rhyme	.
But	we	have	a	problem	.
Our	experience	to	date	,	both	individually	and	collectively	,	has	n't	prepared	us	for	what	we	're	going	to	need	to	do	,	or	who	we	're	going	to	need	to	be	.
We	are	going	to	need	a	new	generation	of	citizen	leaders	willing	to	commit	ourselves	to	growing	and	changing	and	learning	as	rapidly	as	possible	.
That	's	why	I	have	one	last	thing	I	want	to	show	you	.
This	is	a	photograph	taken	about	100	years	ago	of	my	grandfather	and	great-grandfather	.
This	is	a	newspaper	publisher	and	a	banker	.
And	they	were	great	community	leaders	.
And	,	yes	,	they	were	great	philanthropists	.
I	keep	this	photograph	close	by	to	me	--
it	's	in	my	office	--
because	I	've	always	felt	a	mystical	connection	to	these	two	men	,	both	of	whom	I	never	knew	.
And	so	,	in	their	honor	,	I	want	to	offer	you	this	blank	slide	.
And	I	want	you	to	imagine	that	this	a	photograph	of	you	.
And	I	want	you	to	think	about	the	community	that	you	want	to	be	part	of	creating	.	Whatever	that	means	to	you	.
And	I	want	you	to	imagine	that	it	's	100	years	from	now	,	and	your	grandchild	,	or	great-grandchild	,	or	niece	or	nephew	or	god-child	,	is	looking	at	this	photograph	of	you	.
What	is	the	story	you	most	want	for	them	to	tell	?
Thank	you	very	much	.
So	,	how	many	of	you	have	ever	gotten	behind	the	wheel	of	a	car	when	you	really	should	n't	have	been	driving	?
Maybe	you	're	out	on	the	road	for	a	long	day	,	and	you	just	wanted	to	get	home	.
You	were	tired	,	but	you	felt	you	could	drive	a	few	more	miles	.
Maybe	you	thought	,	I	've	had	less	to	drink	than	everybody	else	,	I	should	be	the	one	to	go	home	.
Or	maybe	your	mind	was	just	entirely	elsewhere	.
Does	this	sound	familiar	to	you	?
Now	,	in	those	situations	,	would	n't	it	be	great	if	there	was	a	button	on	your	dashboard	that	you	could	push	,	and	the	car	would	get	you	home	safely	?
Now	,	that	's	been	the	promise	of	the	self-driving	car	,	the	autonomous	vehicle	,	and	it	's	been	the	dream	since	at	least	1939	,	when	General	Motors	showcased	this	idea	at	their	Futurama	booth	at	the	World	's	Fair	.
Now	,	it	's	been	one	of	those	dreams	that	's	always	seemed	about	20	years	in	the	future	.
Now	,	two	weeks	ago	,	that	dream	took	a	step	forward	,	when	the	state	of	Nevada	granted	Google	's	self-driving	car	the	very	first	license	for	an	autonomous	vehicle	,	clearly	establishing	that	it	's	legal	for	them	to	test	it	on	the	roads	in	Nevada	.
Now	,	California	's	considering	similar	legislation	,	and	this	would	make	sure	that	the	autonomous	car	is	not	one	of	those	things	that	has	to	stay	in	Vegas	.
Now	,	in	my	lab	at	Stanford	,	we	've	been	working	on	autonomous	cars	too	,	but	with	a	slightly	different	spin	on	things	.	You	see	,	we	've	been	developing	robotic	race	cars	,	cars	that	can	actually	push	themselves	to	the	very	limits	of	physical	performance	.
Now	,	why	would	we	want	to	do	such	a	thing	?
Well	,	there	's	two	really	good	reasons	for	this	.
First	,	we	believe	that	before	people	turn	over	control	to	an	autonomous	car	,	that	autonomous	car	should	be	at	least	as	good	as	the	very	best	human	drivers	.
Now	,	if	you	're	like	me	,	and	the	other	70	percent	of	the	population	who	know	that	we	are	above-average	drivers	,	you	understand	that	's	a	very	high	bar	.
There	's	another	reason	as	well	.
Just	like	race	car	drivers	can	use	all	of	the	friction	between	the	tire	and	the	road	,	all	of	the	car	's	capabilities	to	go	as	fast	as	possible	,	we	want	to	use	all	of	those	capabilities	to	avoid	any	accident	we	can	.
Now	,	you	may	push	the	car	to	the	limits	not	because	you	're	driving	too	fast	,	but	because	you	've	hit	an	icy	patch	of	road	,	conditions	have	changed	.
In	those	situations	,	we	want	a	car	that	is	capable	enough	to	avoid	any	accident	that	can	physically	be	avoided	.
I	must	confess	,	there	's	kind	of	a	third	motivation	as	well	.
You	see	,	I	have	a	passion	for	racing	.
In	the	past	,	I	've	been	a	race	car	owner	,	a	crew	chief	and	a	driving	coach	,	although	maybe	not	at	the	level	that	you	're	currently	expecting	.
One	of	the	things	that	we	've	developed	in	the	lab	--	we	've	developed	several	vehicles	--	is	what	we	believe	is	the	world	's	first	autonomously	drifting	car	.
It	's	another	one	of	those	categories	where	maybe	there	's	not	a	lot	of	competition	.
But	this	is	P1	.	It	's	an	entirely	student-built	electric	vehicle	,	which	through	using	its	rear-wheel	drive	and	front-wheel	steer-by-wire	can	drift	around	corners	.
It	can	get	sideways	like	a	rally	car	driver	,	always	able	to	take	the	tightest	curve	,	even	on	slippery	,	changing	surfaces	,	never	spinning	out	.
We	've	also	worked	with	Volkswagen	Oracle	,	on	Shelley	,	an	autonomous	race	car	that	has	raced	at	150	miles	an	hour	through	the	Bonneville	Salt	Flats	,	gone	around	Thunderhill	Raceway	Park	in	the	sun	,	the	wind	and	the	rain	,	and	navigated	the	153	turns	and	12.4	miles	of	the	Pikes	Peak	Hill	Climb	route	in	Colorado	with	nobody	at	the	wheel	.
I	guess	it	goes	without	saying	that	we	've	had	a	lot	of	fun	doing	this	.
But	in	fact	,	there	's	something	else	that	we	've	developed	in	the	process	of	developing	these	autonomous	cars	.
We	have	developed	a	tremendous	appreciation	for	the	capabilities	of	human	race	car	drivers	.
As	we	've	looked	at	the	question	of	how	well	do	these	cars	perform	,	we	wanted	to	compare	them	to	our	human	counterparts	.
And	we	discovered	their	human	counterparts	are	amazing	.
Now	,	we	can	take	a	map	of	a	race	track	,	we	can	take	a	mathematical	model	of	a	car	,	and	with	some	iteration	,	we	can	actually	find	the	fastest	way	around	that	track	.
We	line	that	up	with	data	that	we	record	from	a	professional	driver	,	and	the	resemblance	is	absolutely	remarkable	.
Yes	,	there	are	subtle	differences	here	,	but	the	human	race	car	driver	is	able	to	go	out	and	drive	an	amazingly	fast	line	,	without	the	benefit	of	an	algorithm	that	compares	the	trade-off	between	going	as	fast	as	possible	in	this	corner	,	and	shaving	a	little	bit	of	time	off	of	the	straight	over	here	.
Not	only	that	,	they	're	able	to	do	it	lap	after	lap	after	lap	.
They	're	able	to	go	out	and	consistently	do	this	,	pushing	the	car	to	the	limits	every	single	time	.
It	's	extraordinary	to	watch	.
You	put	them	in	a	new	car	,	and	after	a	few	laps	,	they	've	found	the	fastest	line	in	that	car	,	and	they	're	off	to	the	races	.
It	really	makes	you	think	,	we	'd	love	to	know	what	's	going	on	inside	their	brain	.
So	as	researchers	,	that	's	what	we	decided	to	find	out	.
We	decided	to	instrument	not	only	the	car	,	but	also	the	race	car	driver	,	to	try	to	get	a	glimpse	into	what	was	going	on	in	their	head	as	they	were	doing	this	.
Now	,	this	is	Dr.	Lene	Harbott	applying	electrodes	to	the	head	of	John	Morton	.
John	Morton	is	a	former	Can-Am	and	IMSA	driver	,	who	's	also	a	class	champion	at	Le	Mans	.
Fantastic	driver	,	and	very	willing	to	put	up	with	graduate	students	and	this	sort	of	research	.
She	's	putting	electrodes	on	his	head	so	that	we	can	monitor	the	electrical	activity	in	John	's	brain	as	he	races	around	the	track	.
Now	,	clearly	we	're	not	going	to	put	a	couple	of	electrodes	on	his	head	and	understand	exactly	what	all	of	his	thoughts	are	on	the	track	.
However	,	neuroscientists	have	identified	certain	patterns	that	let	us	tease	out	some	very	important	aspects	of	this	.
For	instance	,	the	resting	brain	tends	to	generate	a	lot	of	alpha	waves	.
In	contrast	,	theta	waves	are	associated	with	a	lot	of	cognitive	activity	,	like	visual	processing	,	things	where	the	driver	is	thinking	quite	a	bit	.
Now	,	we	can	measure	this	,	and	we	can	look	at	the	relative	power	between	the	theta	waves	and	the	alpha	waves	.
This	gives	us	a	measure	of	mental	workload	,	how	much	the	driver	is	actually	challenged	cognitively	at	any	point	along	the	track	.
Now	,	we	wanted	to	see	if	we	could	actually	record	this	on	the	track	,	so	we	headed	down	south	to	Laguna	Seca	.
Laguna	Seca	is	a	legendary	raceway	about	halfway	between	Salinas	and	Monterey	.
It	has	a	curve	there	called	the	Corkscrew	.
Now	,	the	Corkscrew	is	a	chicane	,	followed	by	a	quick	right-handed	turn	as	the	road	drops	three	stories	.
Now	,	the	strategy	for	driving	this	as	explained	to	me	was	,	you	aim	for	the	bush	in	the	distance	,	and	as	the	road	falls	away	,	you	realize	it	was	actually	the	top	of	a	tree	.
All	right	,	so	thanks	to	the	Revs	Program	at	Stanford	,	we	were	able	to	take	John	there	and	put	him	behind	the	wheel	of	a	1960	Porsche	Abarth	Carrera	.
Life	is	way	too	short	for	boring	cars	.
So	,	here	you	see	John	on	the	track	,	he	's	going	up	the	hill	--	Oh	!	Somebody	liked	that	--	and	you	can	see	,	actually	,	his	mental	workload	--	measuring	here	in	the	red	bar	--	you	can	see	his	actions	as	he	approaches	.
Now	watch	,	he	has	to	downshift	.
And	then	he	has	to	turn	left	.
Look	for	the	tree	,	and	down	.
Not	surprisingly	,	you	can	see	this	is	a	pretty	challenging	task	.
You	can	see	his	mental	workload	spike	as	he	goes	through	this	,	as	you	would	expect	with	something	that	requires	this	level	of	complexity	.
But	what	's	really	interesting	is	to	look	at	areas	of	the	track	where	his	mental	workload	does	n't	increase	.
I	'm	going	to	take	you	around	now	to	the	other	side	of	the	track	.
Turn	three	.	And	John	's	going	to	go	into	that	corner	and	the	rear	end	of	the	car	is	going	to	begin	to	slide	out	.
He	's	going	to	have	to	correct	for	that	with	steering	.
So	watch	as	John	does	this	here	.
Watch	the	mental	workload	,	and	watch	the	steering	.
The	car	begins	to	slide	out	,	dramatic	maneuver	to	correct	it	,	and	no	change	whatsoever	in	the	mental	workload	.
Not	a	challenging	task	.
In	fact	,	entirely	reflexive	.
Now	,	our	data	processing	on	this	is	still	preliminary	,	but	it	really	seems	that	these	phenomenal	feats	that	the	race	car	drivers	are	performing	are	instinctive	.
They	are	things	that	they	have	simply	learned	to	do	.
It	requires	very	little	mental	workload	for	them	to	perform	these	amazing	feats	.
And	their	actions	are	fantastic	.
This	is	exactly	what	you	want	to	do	on	the	steering	wheel	to	catch	the	car	in	this	situation	.
Now	,	this	has	given	us	tremendous	insight	and	inspiration	for	our	own	autonomous	vehicles	.
We	've	started	to	ask	the	question	:	Can	we	make	them	a	little	less	algorithmic	and	a	little	more	intuitive	?
Can	we	take	this	reflexive	action	that	we	see	from	the	very	best	race	car	drivers	,	introduce	it	to	our	cars	,	and	maybe	even	into	a	system	that	could	get	onto	your	car	in	the	future	?
That	would	take	us	a	long	step	along	the	road	to	autonomous	vehicles	that	drive	as	well	as	the	best	humans	.
But	it	's	made	us	think	a	little	bit	more	deeply	as	well	.
Do	we	want	something	more	from	our	car	than	to	simply	be	a	chauffeur	?
Do	we	want	our	car	to	perhaps	be	a	partner	,	a	coach	,	someone	that	can	use	their	understanding	of	the	situation	to	help	us	reach	our	potential	?
Can	,	in	fact	,	the	technology	not	simply	replace	humans	,	but	allow	us	to	reach	the	level	of	reflex	and	intuition	that	we	're	all	capable	of	?
So	,	as	we	move	forward	into	this	technological	future	,	I	want	you	to	just	pause	and	think	of	that	for	a	moment	.
What	is	the	ideal	balance	of	human	and	machine	?
And	as	we	think	about	that	,	let	's	take	inspiration	from	the	absolutely	amazing	capabilities	of	the	human	body	and	the	human	mind	.
Thank	you	.
I	believe	that	there	are	new	,	hidden	tensions	that	are	actually	happening	between	people	and	institutions	--	institutions	that	are	the	institutions	that	people	inhabit	in	their	daily	life	:	schools	,	hospitals	,	workplaces	,	factories	,	offices	,	etc	.
And	something	that	I	see	happening	is	something	that	I	would	like	to	call	a	sort	of	``	democratization	of	intimacy	.	''
And	what	do	I	mean	by	that	?
I	mean	that	what	people	are	doing	is	,	in	fact	,	they	are	sort	of	,	with	their	communication	channels	,	they	are	breaking	an	imposed	isolation	that	these	institutions	are	imposing	on	them	.
How	are	they	doing	this	?	They	're	doing	it	in	a	very	simple	way	,	by	calling	their	mom	from	work	,	by	IMing	from	their	office	to	their	friends	,	by	texting	under	the	desk	.
The	pictures	that	you	're	seeing	behind	me	are	people	that	I	visited	in	the	last	few	months	.
And	I	asked	them	to	come	along	with	the	person	they	communicate	with	most	.
And	somebody	brought	a	boyfriend	,	somebody	a	father	.
One	young	woman	brought	her	grandfather	.
For	20	years	,	I	've	been	looking	at	how	people	use	channels	such	as	email	,	the	mobile	phone	,	texting	,	etc	.	What	we	're	actually	going	to	see	is	that	,	fundamentally	,	people	are	communicating	on	a	regular	basis	with	five	,	six	,	seven	of	their	most	intimate	sphere	.
Now	,	lets	take	some	data	.	Facebook	.
Recently	some	sociologists	from	Facebook	--	Facebook	is	the	channel	that	you	would	expect	is	the	most	enlargening	of	all	channels	.
And	an	average	user	,	said	Cameron	Marlow	,	from	Facebook	,	has	about	120	friends	.
But	he	actually	talks	to	,	has	two-way	exchanges	with	,	about	four	to	six	people	on	a	regular	base	,	depending	on	his	gender	.
Academic	research	on	instant	messaging	also	shows	100	people	on	buddy	lists	,	but	fundamentally	people	chat	with	two	,	three	,	four	--	anyway	,	less	than	five	.
My	own	research	on	cellphones	and	voice	calls	shows	that	80	percent	of	the	calls	are	actually	made	to	four	people	.	80	percent	.
And	when	you	go	to	Skype	,	it	's	down	to	two	people	.
A	lot	of	sociologists	actually	are	quite	disappointed	.
I	mean	,	I	've	been	a	bit	disappointed	sometimes	when	I	saw	this	data	and	all	this	deployment	,	just	for	five	people	.
And	some	sociologists	actually	feel	that	it	's	a	closure	,	it	's	a	cocooning	,	that	we	're	disengaging	from	the	public	.
And	I	would	actually	,	I	would	like	to	show	you	that	if	we	actually	look	at	who	is	doing	it	,	and	from	where	they	're	doing	it	,	actually	there	is	an	incredible	social	transformation	.
There	are	three	stories	that	I	think	are	quite	good	examples	.
The	first	gentleman	,	he	's	a	baker	.	And	so	he	starts	working	every	morning	at	four	o'clock	in	the	morning	.
And	around	eight	o'clock	he	sort	of	sneaks	away	from	his	oven	,	cleans	his	hands	from	the	flour	and	calls	his	wife	.
He	just	wants	to	wish	her	a	good	day	,	because	that	's	the	start	of	her	day	.
And	I	've	heard	this	story	a	number	of	times	.
A	young	factory	worker	who	works	night	shifts	,	who	manages	to	sneak	away	from	the	factory	floor	,	where	there	is	CCTV	by	the	way	,	and	find	a	corner	,	where	at	11	o'clock	at	night	he	can	call	his	girlfriend	and	just	say	goodnight	.
Or	a	mother	who	,	at	four	o'clock	,	suddenly	manages	to	find	a	corner	in	the	toilet	to	check	that	her	children	are	safely	home	.
Then	there	is	another	couple	,	there	is	a	Brazilian	couple	.
They	've	lived	in	Italy	for	a	number	of	years	.
They	Skype	with	their	families	a	few	times	a	week	.
But	once	a	fortnight	,	they	actually	put	the	computer	on	their	dining	table	,	pull	out	the	webcam	and	actually	have	dinner	with	their	family	in	Sao	Paulo	.	And	they	have	a	big	event	of	it	.
And	I	heard	this	story	the	first	time	a	couple	of	years	ago	from	a	very	modest	family	of	immigrants	from	Kosovo	in	Switzerland	.
They	had	set	up	a	big	screen	in	their	living	room	,
and	every	morning	they	had	breakfast	with	their	grandmother	.
But	Danny	Miller	,	who	is	a	very	good	anthropologist	who	is	working	on	Filipina	migrant	women	who	leave	their	children	back	in	the	Philippines	,	was	telling	me	about	how	much	parenting	is	going	on	through	Skype	,	and	how	much	these	mothers	are	engaged	with	their	children	through	Skype	.
And	then	there	is	the	third	couple	.	They	are	two	friends	.
They	chat	to	each	other	every	day	,	a	few	times	a	day	actually	.
And	finally	,	finally	,	they	've	managed	to	put	instant	messaging	on	their	computers	at	work	.
And	now	,	obviously	,	they	have	it	open	.
Whenever	they	have	a	moment	they	chat	to	each	other	.
And	this	is	exactly	what	we	've	been	seeing	with	teenagers	and	kids	doing	it	in	school	,	under	the	table	,	and	texting	under	the	table	to	their	friends	.
So	,	none	of	these	cases	are	unique	.
I	mean	,	I	could	tell	you	hundreds	of	them	.
But	what	is	really	exceptional	is	the	setting	.
So	,	think	of	the	three	settings	I	've	talked	to	you	about	:	factory	,	migration	,	office	.
But	it	could	be	in	a	school	,	it	could	be	an	administration	,	it	could	be	a	hospital	.
Three	settings	that	,	if	we	just	step	back	15	years	,	if	you	just	think	back	15	years	,	when	you	clocked	in	,	when	you	clocked	in	to	an	office	,	when	you	clocked	in	to	a	factory	,	there	was	no	contact	for	the	whole	duration	of	the	time	,	there	was	no	contact	with	your	private	sphere	.
If	you	were	lucky	there	was	a	public	phone	hanging	in	the	corridor	or	somewhere	.
If	you	were	in	management	,	oh	,	that	was	a	different	story	.
Maybe	you	had	a	direct	line	.
If	you	were	not	,	you	maybe	had	to	go	through	an	operator	.
But	basically	,	when	you	walked	into	those	buildings	,	the	private	sphere	was	left	behind	you	.
And	this	has	become	such	a	norm	of	our	professional	lives	,	such	a	norm	and	such	an	expectation	.
And	it	had	nothing	to	do	with	technical	capability	.
The	phones	were	there	.	But	the	expectation	was	once	you	moved	in	there	your	commitment	was	fully	to	the	task	at	hand	,	fully	to	the	people	around	you	.
That	was	where	the	focus	had	to	be	.
And	this	has	become	such	a	cultural	norm	that	we	actually	school	our	children	for	them	to	be	capable	to	do	this	cleavage	.
If	you	think	nursery	,	kindergarten	,	first	years	of	school	are	just	dedicated	to	take	away	the	children	,	to	make	them	used	to	staying	long	hours	away	from	their	family	.
And	then	the	school	enacts	perfectly	well	.	It	mimics	perfectly	all	the	rituals	that	we	will	find	in	offices	:	rituals	of	entry	,	rituals	of	exit	,	the	schedules	,	the	uniforms	in	this	country	,	things	that	identify	you	,	team-building	activities	,
team	building	that	will	allow	you	to	basically	be	with	a	random	group	of	kids	,	or	a	random	group	of	people	that	you	will	have	to	be	with	for	a	number	of	time	.
And	of	course	,	the	major	thing	:	learn	to	pay	attention	,	to	concentrate	and	focus	your	attention	.
This	only	started	about	150	years	ago	.
It	only	started	with	the	birth	of	modern	bureaucracy	,	and	of	industrial	revolution	.
When	people	basically	had	to	go	somewhere	else	to	work	and	carry	out	the	work	.
And	when	with	modern	bureaucracy	there	was	a	very	rational	approach	,	where	there	was	a	clear	distinction	between	the	private	sphere	and	the	public	sphere	.
So	,	until	then	,	basically	people	were	living	on	top	of	their	trades	.
They	were	living	on	top	of	the	land	they	were	laboring	.
They	were	living	on	top	of	the	workshops	where	they	were	working	.
And	if	you	think	,	it	's	permeated	our	whole	culture	,	even	our	cities	.
If	you	think	of	medieval	cities	,	medieval	cities	the	boroughs	all	have	the	names	of	the	guilds	and	professions	that	lived	there	.
Now	we	have	sprawling	residential	suburbias	that	are	well	distinct	from	production	areas	and	commercial	areas	.
And	actually	,	over	these	150	years	,	there	has	been	a	very	clear	class	system	that	also	has	emerged	.
So	the	lower	the	status	of	the	job	and	of	the	person	carrying	out	,	the	more	removed	he	would	be	from	his	personal	sphere	.
People	have	taken	this	amazing	possibility	of	actually	being	in	contact	all	through	the	day	or	in	all	types	of	situations	.
And	they	are	doing	it	massively	.
The	Pew	Institute	,	which	produces	good	data	on	a	regular	basis	on	,	for	instance	,	in	the	States	,	says	that	--	and	I	think	that	this	number	is	conservative	--	50	percent	of	anybody	with	email	access	at	work	is	actually	doing	private	email	from	his	office	.
I	really	think	that	the	number	is	conservative	.
In	my	own	research	,	we	saw	that	the	peak	for	private	email	is	actually	11	o'clock	in	the	morning	,	whatever	the	country	.
75	percent	of	people	admit	doing	private	conversations	from	work	on	their	mobile	phones	.
100	percent	are	using	text	.
The	point	is	that	this	re-appropriation	of	the	personal	sphere	is	not	terribly	successful	with	all	institutions	.
I	'm	always	surprised	the	U.S.	Army	sociologists	are	discussing	of	the	impact	for	instance	,	of	soldiers	in	Iraq	having	daily	contact	with	their	families	.
But	there	are	many	institutions	that	are	actually	blocking	this	access	.
And	every	day	,	every	single	day	,	I	read	news	that	makes	me	cringe	,	like	a	$	15	fine	to	kids	in	Texas	,	for	using	,	every	time	they	take	out	their	mobile	phone	in	school	.
Immediate	dismissal	to	bus	drivers	in	New	York	,	if	seen	with	a	mobile	phone	in	a	hand	.
Companies	blocking	access	to	IM	or	to	Facebook	.
Behind	issues	of	security	and	safety	,	which	have	always	been	the	arguments	for	social	control	,	in	fact	what	is	going	on	is	that	these	institutions	are	trying	to	decide	who	,	in	fact	,	has	a	right	to	self	determine	their	attention	,	to	decide	,	whether	they	should	,	or	not	,	be	isolated	.
And	they	are	actually	trying	to	block	,	in	a	certain	sense	,	this	movement	of	a	greater	possibility	of	intimacy	.
So	today	,	I	'm	going	to	tell	you	about	some	people	who	did	n't	move	out	of	their	neighborhoods	.
The	first	one	is	happening	right	here	in	Chicago	.
Brenda	Palms-Farber	was	hired	to	help	ex-convicts	reenter	society	and	keep	them	from	going	back	into	prison	.
Currently	,	taxpayers	spend	about	60,000	dollars	per	year	sending	a	person	to	jail	.
We	know	that	two-thirds	of	them	are	going	to	go	back	.
I	find	it	interesting	that	,	for	every	one	dollar	we	spend	,	however	,	on	early	childhood	education	,	like	Head	Start	,	we	save	17	dollars	on	stuff	like	incarceration	in	the	future	.
Or	--	think	about	it	--	that	60,000	dollars	is	more	than	what	it	costs	to	send	one	person	to	Harvard	as	well	.
But	Brenda	,	not	being	phased	by	stuff	like	that	,	took	a	look	at	her	challenge	and	came	up	with	a	not-so-obvious	solution	:	create	a	business	that	produces	skin	care	products	from	honey	.
Okay	,	it	might	be	obvious	to	some	of	you	;	it	was	n't	to	me	.
It	's	the	basis	of	growing	a	form	of	social	innovation	that	has	real	potential	.
She	hired	seemingly	unemployable	men	and	women	to	care	for	the	bees	,	harvest	the	honey	and	make	value-added	products	that	they	marketed	themselves	,	and	that	were	later	sold	at	Whole	Foods	.
She	combined	employment	experience	and	training	with	life	skills	they	needed	,	like	anger-management	and	teamwork	,	and	also	how	to	talk	to	future	employers	about	how	their	experiences	actually	demonstrated	the	lessons	that	they	had	learned	and	their	eagerness	to	learn	more	.
Less	than	four	percent	of	the	folks	that	went	through	her	program	actually	go	back	to	jail	.
So	these	young	men	and	women	learned	job-readiness	and	life	skills	through	bee	keeping	and	became	productive	citizens	in	the	process	.
Talk	about	a	sweet	beginning	.
Now	,	I	'm	going	to	take	you	to	Los	Angeles	,
and	lots	of	people	know	that	L.A.	has	its	issues	.
But	I	'm	going	to	talk	about	L.A.	's	water	issues	right	now	.
They	have	not	enough	water	on	most	days	and	too	much	to	handle	when	it	rains	.
Currently	,	20	percent	of	California	's	energy	consumption	is	used	to	pump	water	into	mostly	Southern	California	.
Their	spending	loads	,	loads	,	to	channel	that	rainwater	out	into	the	ocean	when	it	rains	and	floods	as	well	.
Now	Andy	Lipkis	is	working	to	help	L.A.	cut	infrastructure	costs	associated	with	water	management	and	urban	heat	island	--	linking	trees	,	people	and	technology	to	create	a	more	livable	city	.
All	that	green	stuff	actually	naturally	absorbs	storm	water	,	also	helps	cool	our	cities	.
Because	,	come	to	think	about	it	,	do	you	really	want	air-conditioning	,	or	is	it	a	cooler	room	that	you	want	?
How	you	get	it	should	n't	make	that	much	of	a	difference	.
So	a	few	years	ago	,	L.A.	County	decided	that	they	needed	to	spend	2.5	billion	dollars	to	repair	the	city	schools	.
And	Andy	and	his	team	discovered	that	they	were	going	to	spend	200	million	of	those	dollars	on	asphalt	to	surround	the	schools	themselves	.
And	by	presenting	a	really	strong	economic	case	,	they	convinced	the	L.A.	government	that	replacing	that	asphalt	with	trees	and	other	greenery	,	that	the	schools	themselves	would	save	the	system	more	on	energy	than	they	spend	on	horticultural	infrastructure	.
So	ultimately	,	20	million	square	feet	of	asphalt	was	replaced	or	avoided	,	and	electrical	consumption	for	air-conditioning	went	down	,	while	employment	for	people	to	maintain	those	grounds	went	up	,	resulting	in	a	net-savings	to	the	system	,	but	also	healthier	students	and	schools	system	employees	as	well	.
Now	Judy	Bonds	is	a	coal	miner	's	daughter	.
Her	family	has	eight	generations	in	a	town	called	Whitesville	,	West	Virginia	.
And	if	anyone	should	be	clinging	to	the	former	glory	of	the	coal	mining	history	,	and	of	the	town	,	it	should	be	Judy	.
But	the	way	coal	is	mined	right	now	is	different	from	the	deep	mines	that	her	father	and	her	father	's	father	would	go	down	into	and	that	employed	essentially	thousands	and	thousands	of	people	.
Now	,	two	dozen	men	can	tear	down	a	mountain	in	several	months	,	and	only	for	about	a	few	years	'	worth	of	coal	.
That	kind	of	technology	is	called	``	mountaintop	removal	.	''
It	can	make	a	mountain	go	from	this	to	this	in	a	few	short	months	.
Just	imagine	that	the	air	surrounding	these	places	--	it	's	filled	with	the	residue	of	explosives	and	coal	.
When	we	visited	,	it	gave	some	of	the	people	we	were	with	this	strange	little	cough	after	being	only	there	for	just	a	few	hours	or	so	--	not	just	miners	,	but	everybody	.
And	Judy	saw	her	landscape	being	destroyed	and	her	water	poisoned	.
And	the	coal	companies	just	move	on	after	the	mountain	was	emptied	,	leaving	even	more	unemployment	in	their	wake	.
But	she	also	saw	the	difference	in	potential	wind	energy	on	an	intact	mountain	,	and	one	that	was	reduced	in	elevation	by	over	2,000	feet	.
Three	years	of	dirty	energy	with	not	many	jobs	,	or	centuries	of	clean	energy	with	the	potential	for	developing	expertise	and	improvements	in	efficiency	based	on	technical	skills	,	and	developing	local	knowledge	about	how	to	get	the	most	out	of	that	region	's	wind	.
She	calculated	the	up-front	cost	and	the	payback	over	time	,	and	it	's	a	net-plus	on	so	many	levels	for	the	local	,	national	and	global	economy	.
It	's	a	longer	payback	than	mountaintop	removal	,	but	the	wind	energy	actually	pays	back	forever	.
Now	mountaintop	removal	pays	very	little	money	to	the	locals	,	and	it	gives	them	a	lot	of	misery	.
The	water	is	turned	into	goo	.
Most	people	are	still	unemployed	,	leading	to	most	of	the	same	kinds	of	social	problems	that	unemployed	people	in	inner	cities	also	experience	--	drug	and	alcohol	abuse	,	domestic	abuse	,	teen	pregnancy	and	poor	heath	,	as	well	.
Now	Judy	and	I	--	I	have	to	say	--	totally	related	to	each	other	.
Not	quite	an	obvious	alliance	.
I	mean	,	literally	,	her	hometown	is	called	Whitesville	,	West	Virginia	.
I	mean	,	they	are	not	--	they	ai	n't	competing	for	the	birthplace	of	hip	hop	title	or	anything	like	that	.
But	the	back	of	my	T-shirt	,	the	one	that	she	gave	me	,	says	,	``	Save	the	endangered	hillbillies	.	''
So	homegirls	and	hillbillies	we	got	it	together	and	totally	understand	that	this	is	what	it	's	all	about	.
But	just	a	few	months	ago	,	Judy	was	diagnosed	with	stage-three	lung	cancer	.
Yeah	.
And	it	has	since	moved	to	her	bones	and	her	brain	.
And	I	just	find	it	so	bizarre	that	she	's	suffering	from	the	same	thing	that	she	tried	so	hard	to	protect	people	from	.
But	her	dream	of	Coal	River	Mountain	Wind	is	her	legacy	.
And	she	might	not	get	to	see	that	mountaintop	.
But	rather	than	writing	yet	some	kind	of	manifesto	or	something	,	she	's	leaving	behind	a	business	plan	to	make	it	happen	.
That	's	what	my	homegirl	is	doing	.
So	I	'm	so	proud	of	that	.
But	these	three	people	do	n't	know	each	other	,	but	they	do	have	an	awful	lot	in	common	.
They	're	all	problem	solvers	,	and	they	're	just	some	of	the	many	examples	that	I	really	am	privileged	to	see	,	meet	and	learn	from	in	the	examples	of	the	work	that	I	do	now	.
I	was	really	lucky	to	have	them	all	featured	on	my	Corporation	for	Public	Radio	radio	show	called	ThePromisedLand.org	.
Now	they	're	all	very	practical	visionaries	.
They	take	a	look	at	the	demands	that	are	out	there	--	beauty	products	,	healthy	schools	,	electricity	--	and	how	the	money	's	flowing	to	meet	those	demands	.
And	when	the	cheapest	solutions	involve	reducing	the	number	of	jobs	,	you	're	left	with	unemployed	people	,	and	those	people	are	n't	cheap	.
In	fact	,	they	make	up	some	of	what	I	call	the	most	expensive	citizens	,	and	they	include	generationally	impoverished	,	traumatized	vets	returning	from	the	Middle	East	,	people	coming	out	of	jail	.
And	for	the	veterans	in	particular	,	the	V.A	.	said	there	's	a	six-fold	increase	in	mental	health	pharmaceuticals	by	vets	since	2003	.
I	think	that	number	's	probably	going	to	go	up	.
They	're	not	the	largest	number	of	people	,	but	they	are	some	of	the	most	expensive	--
and	in	terms	of	the	likelihood	for	domestic	abuse	,	drug	and	alcohol	abuse	,	poor	performance	by	their	kids	in	schools	and	also	poor	health	as	a	result	of	stress	.
So	these	three	guys	all	understand	how	to	productively	channel	dollars	through	our	local	economies	to	meet	existing	market	demands	,	reduce	the	social	problems	that	we	have	now	and	prevent	new	problems	in	the	future	.
And	there	are	plenty	of	other	examples	like	that	.
One	problem	:	waste	handling	and	unemployment	.
Even	when	we	think	or	talk	about	recycling	,	lots	of	recyclable	stuff	ends	up	getting	incinerated	or	in	landfills	and	leaving	many	municipalities	,	diversion	rates	--	they	leave	much	to	be	recycled	.
And	where	is	this	waste	handled	?	Usually	in	poor	communities	.
And	we	know	that	eco-industrial	business	,	these	kinds	of	business	models	--	there	's	a	model	in	Europe	called	the	eco-industrial	park	,	where	either	the	waste	of	one	company	is	the	raw	material	for	another	,	or	you	use	recycled	materials	to	make	goods	that	you	can	actually	use	and	sell	.
We	can	create	these	local	markets	and	incentives	for	recycled	materials	to	be	used	as	raw	materials	for	manufacturing	.
And	in	my	hometown	,	we	actually	tried	to	do	one	of	these	in	the	Bronx	,	but	our	mayor	decided	what	he	wanted	to	see	was	a	jail	on	that	same	spot	.
Fortunately	--	because	we	wanted	to	create	hundreds	of	jobs	--	but	after	many	years	,	the	city	wanted	to	build	a	jail	.	They	've	since	abandoned	that	project	,	thank	goodness	.
Another	problem	:	unhealthy	food	systems	and	unemployment	.
Working-class	and	poor	urban	Americans	are	not	benefiting	economically	from	our	current	food	system	.
It	relies	too	much	on	transportation	,	chemical	fertilization	,	big	use	of	water	and	also	refrigeration	.
Mega	agricultural	operations	often	are	responsible	for	poisoning	our	waterways	and	our	land	,	and	it	produces	this	incredibly	unhealthy	product	that	costs	us	billions	in	healthcare	and	lost	productivity	.
And	so	we	know	``	urban	ag	''	is	a	big	buzz	topic	this	time	of	the	year	,	but	it	's	mostly	gardening	,	which	has	some	value	in	community	building	--	lots	of	it	--	but	it	's	not	in	terms	of	creating	jobs	or	for	food	production	.
The	numbers	just	are	n't	there	.
Part	of	my	work	now	is	really	laying	the	groundwork	to	integrate	urban	ag	and	rural	food	systems	to	hasten	the	demise	of	the	3,000-mile	salad	by	creating	a	national	brand	of	urban-grown	produce	in	every	city	,	that	uses	regional	growing	power	and	augments	it	with	indoor	growing	facilities	,	owned	and	operated	by	small	growers	,	where	now	there	are	only	consumers	.
This	can	support	seasonal	farmers	around	metro	areas	who	are	losing	out	because	they	really	ca	n't	meet	the	year-round	demand	for	produce	.
It	's	not	a	competition	with	rural	farm	;	it	's	actually	reinforcements	.
It	allies	in	a	really	positive	and	economically	viable	food	system	.
The	goal	is	to	meet	the	cities	'	institutional	demands	for	hospitals	,	senior	centers	,	schools	,	daycare	centers	,	and	produce	a	network	of	regional	jobs	,	as	well	.
This	is	smart	infrastructure	.
And	how	we	manage	our	built	environment	affects	the	health	and	well-being	of	people	every	single	day	.
Our	municipalities	,	rural	and	urban	,	play	the	operational	course	of	infrastructure	--	things	like	waste	disposal	,	energy	demand	,	as	well	as	social	costs	of	unemployment	,	drop-out	rates	,	incarceration	rates	and	the	impacts	of	various	public	health	costs	.
Smart	infrastructure	can	provide	cost-saving	ways	for	municipalities	to	handle	both	infrastructure	and	social	needs	.
And	we	want	to	shift	the	systems	that	open	the	doors	for	people	who	were	formerly	tax	burdens	to	become	part	of	the	tax	base	.
And	imagine	a	national	business	model	that	creates	local	jobs	and	smart	infrastructure	to	improve	local	economic	stability	.
So	I	'm	hoping	you	can	see	a	little	theme	here	.
These	examples	indicate	a	trend	.
I	have	n't	created	it	,	and	it	's	not	happening	by	accident	.
I	'm	noticing	that	it	's	happening	all	over	the	country	,	and	the	good	news	is	that	it	's	growing	.
And	we	all	need	to	be	invested	in	it	.
It	is	an	essential	pillar	to	this	country	's	recovery	.
And	I	call	it	``	hometown	security	.	''
The	recession	has	us	reeling	and	fearful	,	and	there	's	something	in	the	air	these	days	that	is	also	very	empowering	.
It	's	a	realization	that	we	are	the	key	to	our	own	recovery	.
Now	is	the	time	for	us	to	act	in	our	own	communities	where	we	think	local	and	we	act	local	.
And	when	we	do	that	,	our	neighbors	--	be	they	next-door	,	or	in	the	next	state	,	or	in	the	next	country	--	will	be	just	fine	.
The	sum	of	the	local	is	the	global	.
Hometown	security	means	rebuilding	our	natural	defenses	,	putting	people	to	work	,	restoring	our	natural	systems	.
Hometown	security	means	creating	wealth	here	at	home	,	instead	of	destroying	it	overseas	.	Tackling	social	and	environmental	problems	at	the	same	time	with	the	same	solution	yields	great	cost	savings	,	wealth	generation	and	national	security	.
Many	great	and	inspiring	solutions	have	been	generated	across	America	.
The	challenge	for	us	now	is	to	identify	and	support	countless	more	.
Now	,	hometown	security	is	about	taking	care	of	your	own	,	but	it	's	not	like	the	old	saying	,	``	charity	begins	at	home	.	''
I	recently	read	a	book	called	``	Love	Leadership	''	by	John	Hope	Bryant	.
And	it	's	about	leading	in	a	world	that	really	does	seem	to	be	operating	on	the	basis	of	fear	.
And	reading	that	book	made	me	reexamine	that	theory	because	I	need	to	explain	what	I	mean	by	that	.
See	,	my	dad	was	a	great	,	great	man	in	many	ways	.
He	grew	up	in	the	segregated	South	,	escaped	lynching	and	all	that	during	some	really	hard	times	,	and	he	provided	a	really	stable	home	for	me	and	my	siblings	and	a	whole	bunch	of	other	people	that	fell	on	hard	times	.
But	,	like	all	of	us	,	he	had	some	problems	.
And	his	was	gambling	,	compulsively	.
To	him	that	phrase	,	``	Charity	begins	at	home	,	''	meant	that	my	payday	--	or	someone	else	's	--	would	just	happen	to	coincide	with	his	lucky	day	.
So	you	need	to	help	him	out	.
And	sometimes	I	would	loan	him	money	from	my	after-school	or	summer	jobs	,	and	he	always	had	the	great	intention	of	paying	me	back	with	interest	,	of	course	,	after	he	hit	it	big	.
And	he	did	sometimes	,	believe	it	or	not	,	at	a	racetrack	in	Los	Angeles	--	one	reason	to	love	L.A.	--	back	in	the	1940s	.
He	made	15,000	dollars	cash	and	bought	the	house	that	I	grew	up	in	.
So	I	'm	not	that	unhappy	about	that	.
But	listen	,	I	did	feel	obligated	to	him	,	and	I	grew	up	--	then	I	grew	up	.
And	I	'm	a	grown	woman	now	,
and	I	have	learned	a	few	things	along	the	way	.
To	me	,	charity	often	is	just	about	giving	,	because	you	're	supposed	to	,	or	because	it	's	what	you	've	always	done	,	or	it	's	about	giving	until	it	hurts	.
I	'm	about	providing	the	means	to	build	something	that	will	grow	and	intensify	its	original	investment	and	not	just	require	greater	giving	next	year	--	I	'm	not	trying	to	feed	the	habit	.
I	spent	some	years	watching	how	good	intentions	for	community	empowerment	,	that	were	supposed	to	be	there	to	support	the	community	and	empower	it	,	actually	left	people	in	the	same	,	if	not	worse	,	position	that	they	were	in	before	.
And	over	the	past	20	years	,	we	've	spent	record	amounts	of	philanthropic	dollars	on	social	problems	,	yet	educational	outcomes	,	malnutrition	,	incarceration	,	obesity	,	diabetes	,	income	disparity	,	they	've	all	gone	up	with	some	exceptions	--	in	particular	,	infant	mortality	among	people	in	poverty	--	but	it	's	a	great	world	that	we	're	bringing	them	into	as	well	.
And	I	know	a	little	bit	about	these	issues	,	because	,	for	many	years	,	I	spent	a	long	time	in	the	non-profit	industrial	complex	,
and	I	'm	a	recovering	executive	director	,	two	years	clean	.
But	during	that	time	,	I	realized	that	it	was	about	projects	and	developing	them	on	the	local	level	that	really	was	going	to	do	the	right	thing	for	our	communities	.
But	I	really	did	struggle	for	financial	support	.
The	greater	our	success	,	the	less	money	came	in	from	foundations	.
And	I	tell	you	,	being	on	the	TED	stage	and	winning	a	MacArthur	in	the	same	exact	year	gave	everyone	the	impression	that	I	had	arrived	.
And	by	the	time	I	'd	moved	on	,	I	was	actually	covering	a	third	of	my	agency	's	budget	deficit	with	speaking	fees	.
And	I	think	because	early	on	,	frankly	,	my	programs	were	just	a	little	bit	ahead	of	their	time	.
But	since	then	,	the	park	that	was	just	a	dump	and	was	featured	at	a	TED2006	Talk	became	this	little	thing	.
But	I	did	in	fact	get	married	in	it	.
Over	here	.
There	goes	my	dog	who	led	me	to	the	park	in	my	wedding	.
The	South	Bronx	Greenway	was	also	just	a	drawing	on	the	stage	back	in	2006	.
Since	then	,	we	got	about	50	million	dollars	in	stimulus	package	money	to	come	and	get	here	.
And	we	love	this	,	because	I	love	construction	now	,	because	we	're	watching	these	things	actually	happen	.
So	I	want	everyone	to	understand	the	critical	importance	of	shifting	charity	into	enterprise	.
I	started	my	firm	to	help	communities	across	the	country	realize	their	own	potential	to	improve	everything	about	the	quality	of	life	for	their	people	.
Hometown	security	is	next	on	my	to-do	list	.
What	we	need	are	people	who	see	the	value	in	investing	in	these	types	of	local	enterprises	,	who	will	partner	with	folks	like	me	to	identify	the	growth	trends	and	climate	adaptation	as	well	as	understand	the	growing	social	costs	of	business	as	usual	.
We	need	to	work	together	to	embrace	and	repair	our	land	,	repair	our	power	systems	and	repair	ourselves	.
It	's	time	to	stop	building	the	shopping	malls	,	the	prisons	,	the	stadiums	and	other	tributes	to	all	of	our	collective	failures	.
It	is	time	that	we	start	building	living	monuments	to	hope	and	possibility	.
Thank	you	very	much	.
I	,	like	many	of	you	,	am	one	of	the	two	billion	people	on	Earth	who	live	in	cities	.
And	there	are	days	--	I	do	n't	know	about	the	rest	of	you	guys	--	but	there	are	days	when	I	palpably	feel	how	much	I	rely	on	other	people	for	pretty	much	everything	in	my	life	.
And	some	days	,	that	can	even	be	a	little	scary	.
But	what	I	'm	here	to	talk	to	you	about	today	is	how	that	same	interdependence	is	actually	an	extremely	powerful	social	infrastructure	that	we	can	actually	harness	to	help	heal	some	of	our	deepest	civic	issues	,	if	we	apply	open	source	collaboration	.
A	couple	of	years	ago	,	I	read	an	article	by	New	York	Times	writer	Michael	Pollan	in	which	he	argued	that	growing	even	some	of	our	own	food	is	one	of	the	best	things	that	we	can	do	for	the	environment	.
Now	at	the	time	that	I	was	reading	this	,	it	was	the	middle	of	the	winter	and	I	definitely	did	not	have	room	for	a	lot	of	dirt	in	my	New	York	City	apartment	.
So	I	was	basically	just	willing	to	settle	for	just	reading	the	next	Wired	magazine	and	finding	out	how	the	experts	were	going	to	figure	out	how	to	solve	all	these	problems	for	us	in	the	future	.
But	that	was	actually	exactly	the	point	that	Michael	Pollan	was	making	in	this	article	--	was	it	's	precisely	when	we	hand	over	the	responsibility	for	all	these	things	to	specialists	that	we	cause	the	kind	of	messes	that	we	see	with	the	food	system	.
So	,	I	happen	to	know	a	little	bit	from	my	own	work	about	how	NASA	has	been	using	hydroponics	to	explore	growing	food	in	space	.
And	you	can	actually	get	optimal	nutritional	yield	by	running	a	kind	of	high-quality	liquid	soil	over	plants	'	root	systems	.
Now	to	a	vegetable	plant	,	my	apartment	has	got	to	be	about	as	foreign	as	outer	space	.
But	I	can	offer	some	natural	light	and	year-round	climate	control	.
Fast-forward	two	years	later	:	we	now	have	window	farms	,	which	are	vertical	,	hydroponic	platforms	for	food-growing	indoors	.
And	the	way	it	works	is	that	there	's	a	pump	at	the	bottom	,	which	periodically	sends	some	of	this	liquid	nutrient	solution	up	to	the	top	,	which	then	trickles	down	through	plants	'	root	systems	that	are	suspended	in	clay	pellets	--	so	there	's	no	dirt	involved	.
Now	light	and	temperature	vary	with	each	window	's	microclimate	,	so	a	window	farm	requires	a	farmer	,	and	she	must	decide	what	kind	of	crops	she	is	going	to	put	in	her	window	farm	,	and	whether	she	is	going	to	feed	her	food	organically	.
Back	at	the	time	,	a	window	farm	was	no	more	than	a	technically	complex	idea	that	was	going	to	require	a	lot	of	testing	.
And	I	really	wanted	it	to	be	an	open	project	,	because	hydroponics	is	one	of	the	fastest	growing	areas	of	patenting	in	the	United	States	right	now	and	could	possibly	become	another	area	like	Monsanto	,	where	we	have	a	lot	of	corporate	intellectual	property	in	the	way	of	people	's	food	.
So	I	decided	that	,	instead	of	creating	a	product	,	what	I	was	going	to	do	was	open	this	up	to	a	whole	bunch	of	co-developers	.
The	first	few	systems	that	we	created	,	they	kind	of	worked	.
We	were	actually	able	to	grow	about	a	salad	a	week	in	a	typical	New	York	City	apartment	window	.
And	we	were	able	to	grow	cherry	tomatoes	and	cucumbers	,	all	kinds	of	stuff	.
But	the	first	few	systems	were	these	leaky	,	loud	power-guzzlers	that	Martha	Stewart	would	definitely	never	have	approved	.
So	to	bring	on	more	co-developers	,	what	we	did	was	we	created	a	social	media	site	on	which	we	published	the	designs	,	we	explained	how	they	worked	,	and	we	even	went	so	far	as	to	point	out	everything	that	was	wrong	with	these	systems	.
And	then	we	invited	people	all	over	the	world	to	build	them	and	experiment	with	us	.
So	actually	now	on	this	website	,	we	have	18,000	people	.
And	we	have	window	farms	all	over	the	world	.
What	we	're	doing	is	what	NASA	or	a	large	corporation	would	call	R	&	amp	;	D	,	or	research	and	development	.
But	what	we	call	it	is	R	&	amp	;	D-I-Y	,	or	research	and	develop	it	yourself	.
So	for	example	,	Jackson	came	along	and	suggested	that	we	use	air	pumps	instead	of	water	pumps	.
It	took	building	a	whole	bunch	of	systems	to	get	it	right	,	but	once	we	did	,	we	were	able	to	cut	our	carbon	footprint	nearly	in	half	.
Tony	in	Chicago	has	been	taking	on	growing	experiments	,	like	lots	of	other	window	farmers	,	and	he	's	been	able	to	get	his	strawberries	to	fruit	for	nine	months	of	the	year	in	low-light	conditions	by	simply	changing	out	the	organic	nutrients	.
And	window	farmers	in	Finland	have	been	customizing	their	window	farms	for	the	dark	days	of	the	Finnish	winters	by	outfitting	them	with	LED	grow	lights	that	they	're	now	making	open	source	and	part	of	the	project	.
So	window	farms	have	been	evolving	through	a	rapid	versioning	process	similar	to	software	.
And	with	every	open	source	project	,	the	real	benefit	is	the	interplay	between	the	specific	concerns	of	people	customizing	their	systems	for	their	own	particular	concerns	and	the	universal	concerns	.
So	my	core	team	and	I	are	able	to	concentrate	on	the	improvements	that	really	benefit	everyone	.
And	we	're	able	to	look	out	for	the	needs	of	newcomers	.
So	for	do-it-yourselfers	,	we	provide	free	,	very	well-tested	instructions	so	that	anyone	,	anywhere	around	the	world	,	can	build	one	of	these	systems	for	free	.
And	there	's	a	patent	pending	on	these	systems	as	well	that	's	held	by	the	community	.
And	to	fund	the	project	,	we	partner	to	create	products	that	we	then	sell	to	schools	and	to	individuals	who	do	n't	have	time	to	build	their	own	systems	.
Now	within	our	community	,	a	certain	culture	has	appeared	.
In	our	culture	,	it	is	better	to	be	a	tester	who	supports	someone	else	's	idea	than	it	is	to	be	just	the	idea	guy	.
What	we	get	out	of	this	project	is	we	get	support	for	our	own	work	,	as	well	as	an	experience	of	actually	contributing	to	the	environmental	movement	in	a	way	other	than	just	screwing	in	new	light	bulbs	.
But	I	think	that	Eileen	expresses	best	what	we	really	get	out	of	this	,	which	is	the	actual	joy	of	collaboration	.
So	she	expresses	here	what	it	's	like	to	see	someone	halfway	across	the	world	having	taken	your	idea	,	built	upon	it	and	then	acknowledging	you	for	contributing	.
If	we	really	want	to	see	the	kind	of	wide	consumer	behavior	change	that	we	're	all	talking	about	as	environmentalists	and	food	people	,	maybe	we	just	need	to	ditch	the	term	``	consumer	''	and	get	behind	the	people	who	are	doing	stuff	.
Open	source	projects	tend	to	have	a	momentum	of	their	own	.
And	what	we	're	seeing	is	that	R	&	amp	;	D-I-Y	has	moved	beyond	just	window	farms	and	LEDs	into	solar	panels	and	aquaponic	systems	.
And	we	're	building	upon	innovations	of	generations	who	went	before	us	.
And	we	're	looking	ahead	at	generations	who	really	need	us	to	retool	our	lives	now	.
So	we	ask	that	you	join	us	in	rediscovering	the	value	of	citizens	united	,	and	to	declare	that	we	are	all	still	pioneers	.
Most	people	do	n't	know	that	when	I	went	to	high	school	in	this	country	--	I	applied	for	university	at	a	time	when	I	was	convinced	I	was	going	to	be	an	artist	and	be	a	sculptor	.
And	I	came	from	a	very	privileged	background	.	I	was	very	lucky	.
My	family	was	wealthy	,	and	my	father	believed	in	one	thing	,	and	that	was	to	give	us	all	as	much	education	as	we	wanted	.
And	I	announced	I	wanted	to	be	a	sculptor	in	Paris	.
And	he	was	a	clever	man	.	He	sort	of	said	,	``	Well	,	that	's	OK	,	but	you	've	done	very	well	in	your	math	SATs	.	''	In	fact	,	I	'd	got	an	800	.	And	he	thought	I	did	very	well	--	and	I	did	,	too	--	in	the	arts	:
this	was	my	passion	.
And	he	said	``	If	you	go	to	MIT	,	''	to	which	I	had	been	given	early	admission	,	``	I	will	pay	for	every	year	you	're	at	MIT	,	in	graduate	or	undergraduate	--	as	much	as	you	want	--	I	will	pay	for	an	equal	number	of	years	for	you	to	live	in	Paris	.	''	And	I	thought	that	was	the	best	deal	in	town	,	so	I	accepted	it	immediately	.
And	I	decided	that	if	I	was	good	in	art	,	and	I	was	good	in	mathematics	,	I	'd	study	architecture	,	which	was	the	blending	of	the	two	.
I	went	and	told	my	headmaster	that	,	at	prep	school	.
And	I	said	to	him	what	I	was	doing	,	that	I	was	going	to	go	study	architecture	because	it	was	art	and	mathematics	put	together	.
He	said	to	me	something	that	just	went	completely	over	my	head	.
He	said	,	``	You	know	,	I	like	grey	suits	,	and	I	like	pin-striped	suits	,	but	I	do	n't	like	grey	pin-striped	suits	.	''	And	I	thought	,	``	What	a	turkey	this	guy	is	,	''	and	I	went	off	to	MIT	.
I	studied	architecture	,	then	did	a	second	degree	in	architecture	,	and	then	actually	quickly	realized	that	it	was	n't	architecture	.
That	really	,	the	mixing	of	art	and	science	was	computers	,
and	that	that	really	was	the	place	to	bring	both	,	and	enjoyed	a	career	doing	that	.
And	probably	,	if	I	were	to	fill	out	Jim	Citrin	's	scale	,	I	'd	put	100	percent	on	the	side	of	the	equation	where	you	spend	time	making	it	possible	for	others	to	be	creative	.
And	after	doing	this	for	a	long	time	,	and	the	Media	Lab	passing	the	baton	on	,	I	thought	,	``	Well	,	maybe	it	's	time	for	me	to	do	a	project	.	Something	that	would	be	important	,	but	also	something	that	would	take	advantage	of	all	of	these	privileges	that	one	had	.	''	And	in	the	case	of	the	Media	Lab	,	knowing	a	lot	of	people	,
knowing	people	who	were	either	executives	or	wealthy	,	and	also	not	having	,	in	my	own	case	,	a	career	to	worry	about	anymore	.
My	career	,	I	mean	,	I	'd	done	my	career	.
Did	n't	have	to	worry	about	earning	money	.	Did	n't	have	to	worry	about	what	people	thought	about	me	.
And	I	said	,	``	Boy	,	let	's	really	do	something	that	takes	advantage	of	all	these	features	,	''	and	thought	that	if	we	could	address	education	,	by	leveraging	the	children	,	and	bringing	to	the	world	the	access	of	the	computers	,	that	that	was	really	the	thing	we	should	do	.
Never	shown	this	picture	before	,	and	probably	going	to	be	sued	for	it	.	It	's	taken	at	three	o'clock	in	the	morning	,	without	the	permission	of	the	company	.
It	's	about	two	weeks	old	.	There	they	are	,	folks	.
If	you	look	at	the	picture	,	you	'll	see	they	're	stacked	up	.
Those	are	conveyor	belts	that	go	around	.
This	is	one	of	the	conveyor	belts	with	the	thing	going	by	,	but	then	you	'll	see	the	ones	up	above	.
What	happens	is	,	they	burn	into	flash	memory	the	software	,	and	then	test	them	for	a	few	hours	.
But	you	've	got	to	have	the	thing	moving	on	the	assembly	line	,	because	it	's	constant	.
So	they	go	around	in	this	loop	,	which	is	why	you	see	them	up	there	.
So	this	was	great	for	us	because	it	was	a	real	turning	point	.	But	it	goes	back	.
This	picture	was	taken	in	1982	,	just	before	the	IBM	PC	was	even	announced	.
Seymour	Papert	and	I	were	bringing	computers	to	schools
and	developing	nations	at	a	time	when	it	was	way	ahead	of	itself	.
But	one	thing	we	learned	was	that	these	kids	can	absolutely	jump	into	it	just	the	same	way	as	our	kids	do	here	.
And	when	people	tell	me	,	``	Who	's	going	to	teach	the	teachers	to	teach	the	kids	?	''	I	say	to	myself	,	``	What	planet	do	you	come	from	?	''	Okay	,	there	's	not	a	person	in	this	room	--	I	do	n't	care	how	techie	you	are	--	there	's	not	a	person	in	this	room	that	does	n't	give	their	laptop	or	cell	phone	to	a	kid	to	help	them	debug	it	.	OK	?
We	all	need	help	,	even	those	of	us	who	are	very	seasoned	.
This	picture	of	Seymour	--	25	years	ago	.	Seymour	made	a	very	simple	observation	in	1968	,	and	then	basically	presented	it	in	1970	--	April	11	to	be	precise	--	called	``	Teaching	Children	Thinking	.	''	What	he	observed	was	that	kids	who	write	computer	programs	understand	things	differently	,	and	when	they	debug	the	programs	,	they	come	the	closest	to	learning	about	learning	.
That	was	very	important	,	and	in	some	sense	,	we	've	lost	that	.
Kids	do	n't	program	enough	and	boy	,	if	there	's	anything	I	hope	this	brings	back	,	it	's	programming	to	kids	.
It	's	really	important	.	Using	applications	is	OK	,	but	programming	is	absolutely	fundamental	.
This	is	being	launched	with	three	languages	in	it	:	Squeak	,	Logo	,	and	a	third	,	that	I	've	never	even	seen	before	.
The	point	being	,	this	is	going	to	be	very	,	very	intensive	on	the	programming	side	.
This	photograph	is	very	important	because	it	's	much	later	.
This	is	in	the	early	2000s	.	My	son	,	Dimitri	--	who	's	here	,	many	of	you	know	Dimitri	--	went	to	Cambodia	,	set	up	this	school	that	we	had	built	,	just	as	the	school	connected	it	to	the	Internet	.
And	these	kids	had	their	laptops	.	But	it	was	really	what	spirited	this	,	plus	the	influence	of	Joe	and	others	.	We	started	One	Laptop	per	Child	.
This	is	the	same	village	in	Cambodia	,	just	a	couple	of	months	ago	.
These	kids	are	real	pros	.	There	were	just	7,000	machines	out	there	being	tested	by	kids	.	Being	a	nonprofit	is	absolutely	fundamental	.
Everybody	advised	me	not	to	be	a	nonprofit	,	but	they	were	all	wrong	.
And	the	reason	being	a	nonprofit	is	important	is	actually	twofold	.
There	are	many	reasons	,	but	the	two	that	merit	the	little	bit	of	time	is	:	one	,	the	clarity	of	purpose	is	there	.	The	moral	purpose	is	clear	.
I	can	see	any	head	of	state	,	any	executive	I	want	,	at	any	time	,	because	I	'm	not	selling	laptops	.	OK	?	I	have	no	shareholders	.
Whether	we	sell	,	it	does	n't	make	any	difference	whatsoever	.	The	clarity	of	purpose	is	absolutely	critical	.	And	the	second	is	very	counterintuitive	--	you	can	get	the	best	people	in	the	world	.
If	you	look	at	our	professional	services	,	including	search	firms	,	including	communications	,	including	legal	services	,	including	banking	,	they	're	all	pro	bono	.	And	it	's	not	to	save	money	.
We	've	got	money	in	the	bank	.	It	's	because	you	get	the	best	people	.
You	get	the	people	who	are	doing	it	because	they	believe	in	the	mission	,	and	they	're	the	best	people	.
We	could	n't	afford	to	hire	a	CFO	.	We	put	out	a	job	description	for	a	CFO	at	zero	salary	,	and	we	had	a	queue	of	people	.
It	allows	you	to	team	up	with	people	.	The	U.N.	's	not	going	to	be	our	partner	if	we	're	profit	making	.	So	announcing	this	with	Kofi	Annan	was	very	important	,	and	the	U.N.	allowed	us	to	basically	reach	all	the	countries	.	And	this	was	the	machine	we	were	showing	before	I	met	Yves	Behar	.
And	while	this	machine	in	some	sense	is	silly	,	in	retrospect	,	it	actually	served	a	very	important	purpose	.
That	pencil-yellow	crank	was	remembered	by	everybody	.
Everybody	remembered	the	pencil-yellow	crank	.	It	's	different	.
It	was	getting	its	power	in	a	different	way	.	It	's	kind	of	childlike	.
Even	though	this	was	n't	the	direction	we	went	because	the	crank	--	it	really	is	stupid	to	have	it	on	board	,	by	the	way	.
In	spite	of	what	some	people	in	the	press	do	n't	get	it	,	did	n't	understand	it	,	we	did	n't	take	it	off	because	we	did	n't	want	to	do	--	having	it	on	the	laptop	itself	is	really	not	what	you	want	.
You	want	a	separate	thing	,	like	the	AC	adaptor	.
I	did	n't	bring	one	with	me	,	but	they	really	work	much	better	off-board	.
And	then	,	I	could	tell	you	lots	about	the	laptop	,	but	I	decided	on	just	four	things	.
Just	keep	in	mind	--	because	there	are	other	people	,	including	Bill	Gates	,	who	said	,	``	Gee	,	you	've	got	a	real	computer	.	''	That	computer	is	unlike	anything	you	've	had	,	and	does	things	--	there	are	four	of	them	--	that	you	do	n't	come	close	to	.	And	it	's	very	important	to	be	low	power	,	and	I	hope	that	's	picked	up	more	by	the	industry	.
That	the	reason	that	you	want	to	be	below	two	watts	is	that	's	roughly	what	you	can	generate	with	your	upper	body	.
Dual-mode	display	--	that	sunlight	display	's	fantastic	.
We	were	using	it	at	lunch	today	in	the	sunlight	,	and	the	more	sunlight	the	better	.
And	that	was	really	critical	.	The	mesh	network	,	it	'll	become	commonplace	.
And	of	course	,	``	rugged	''	goes	without	saying	.
And	the	reason	I	think	design	matters	is	n't	because	I	wanted	to	go	to	art	school	.
And	by	the	way	,	when	I	graduated	from	MIT	,	I	thought	the	worst	and	silliest	thing	to	do	would	be	to	go	to	Paris	for	six	years	.
So	,	I	did	n't	do	that	.	But	design	matters	for	a	number	of	reasons	.
The	most	important	being	that	it	is	the	best	way	to	make	an	inexpensive	product	.
Most	people	make	inexpensive	products	by	taking	cheap	design	,	cheap	labor	,	cheap	components	,	and	making	a	cheap	laptop	.
And	,	in	English	,	the	word	``	cheap	''	has	a	double	meaning	,	which	is	really	appropriate	,
because	it	's	cheap	,	in	the	pejorative	sense	,	as	well	as	inexpensive	.
But	if	you	take	a	different	approach	,	and	you	think	of	very	large-scale	integration	,	very	advanced	materials	,	very	advanced	manufacturing	--	so	you	're	pouring	chemicals	in	one	end	,	iPods	are	spewing	out	the	other	--	and	really	cool	design	,	that	's	what	we	wanted	to	do	.
And	I	can	race	through	these	and	save	a	lot	of	time	because	Yves	and	I	obviously	did	n't	compare	notes	.
These	are	his	slides	,	and	so	I	do	n't	have	to	talk	about	them	.
But	it	was	really	,	to	us	,	very	important	as	a	strategy	.
It	was	n't	just	to	kind	of	make	it	cute	,	because	somebody	--	you	know	,	good	design	is	very	important	.
Yves	showed	one	of	the	power-generating	devices	.
The	mesh	network	,	the	reason	I	--	and	I	wo	n't	go	into	it	in	great	detail	--	but	when	we	deliver	laptops	to	kids	in	the	remotest	and	poorest	parts	of	the	world	,	they	're	connected	.	There	's	not	just	laptops	.
And	so	,	we	have	to	drop	in	satellite	dishes	.	We	put	in	generators	.
It	's	a	lot	of	stuff	that	goes	behind	these	.	These	can	talk	to	each	other	.
If	you	're	in	a	desert	,	they	can	talk	to	each	other	about	two	kilometers	apart	.
If	you	're	in	the	jungle	,	it	's	about	500	meters	.	So	if	a	kid	bicycles	home	,	or	walks	a	few	miles	,	they	're	going	to	be	off	the	grid	,	so	to	speak	.
They	're	not	going	to	be	near	another	laptop	,	so	you	have	to	nail	these	onto	a	tree	,	and	sort	of	,	get	it	.
You	do	n't	call	Verizon	or	Sprint	.	You	build	your	own	network	.
And	that	's	very	important	,	the	user	interface	.
We	are	launching	with	18	keyboards	.	English	is	by	far	the	minority	.
Latin	is	relatively	rare	,	too	.	You	just	look	at	some	of	the	languages	.
I	'm	willing	to	suspect	some	of	you	had	n't	even	heard	of	them	before	.
Is	there	anybody	in	the	room	,	one	person	,	unless	you	work	with	OLPC	,	is	there	anybody	in	the	room	that	can	tell	me	what	language	the	keyboard	is	that	's	on	the	screen	?	There	's	only	one	hand	--	so	you	get	it	.
Yes	,	you	're	right	.	He	's	right	.	It	's	Amharic	,	it	's	Ethiopian	.	In	Ethiopia	,	there	's	never	been	a	keyboard	.
There	is	no	keyboard	standard	because	there	's	no	market	.
And	this	is	the	big	difference	.
Again	,	when	you	're	a	nonprofit	,	you	look	at	children	as	a	mission	,	not	as	a	market	.
So	we	went	to	Ethiopia	,	and	we	helped	them	make	a	keyboard	.
And	this	will	become	the	standard	Ethiopian	keyboard	.
So	what	I	want	to	end	with	is	sort	of	what	we	're	doing	to	roll	it	out	.
And	we	changed	strategy	completely	.	I	decided	at	the	beginning	--	it	was	a	pretty	good	thing	to	decide	in	the	beginning	,	it	's	not	what	we	're	doing	now	--	is	to	go	to	six	countries	.
Big	countries	,	one	of	them	is	not	so	big	,	but	it	's	rich	.
Here	's	the	six	.	We	went	to	the	six	,	and	in	each	case	the	head	of	state	said	he	would	do	it	,	he	'd	do	a	million	.
In	the	case	of	Qaddafi	,	he	'd	do	1.2	million	,	and	that	they	would	launch	it	.
We	thought	,	this	is	exactly	the	right	strategy	,	get	it	out	,	and	then	the	little	countries	could	sort	of	piggyback	on	these	big	countries	.
And	so	I	went	to	each	of	those	countries	at	least	six	times	,	met	with	the	head	of	state	probably	two	or	three	times	.
In	each	case	,	got	the	ministers	,	went	through	a	lot	of	the	stuff	.
This	was	a	period	in	my	life	where	I	was	traveling	330	days	per	year	.
Not	something	you	'd	envy	or	want	to	do	.
In	the	case	of	Libya	,	it	was	a	lot	of	fun	meeting	Qaddafi	in	his	tent	.
The	camel	smells	were	unbelievable	.
And	it	was	45	degrees	C.	I	mean	,	this	was	not	what	you	'd	call	a	cool	experience	.	And	former	countries	--	I	say	former	,	because	none	of	them	really	came	through	this	summer	--
there	was	a	big	difference	between	getting	a	head	of	state	to	have	a	photo	opportunity	,	make	a	press	release	.	So	we	went	to	smaller	ones	.	Uruguay	,	bless	their	hearts	.
Small	country	,	not	so	rich	.	President	said	he	'd	do	it	,	and	guess	what	?
He	did	do	it	.	The	tender	had	nothing	in	it	that	related	to	us	,	nothing	specific	about	sunlight-readable	,	mesh-network	,	low-power	,	but	just	a	vanilla	laptop	proposal	.
And	guess	what	?	We	won	it	hands	down	.
When	it	was	announced	that	they	were	going	to	do	every	child	in	Uruguay	,	the	first	100,000	,	boom	,	went	to	OLPC	.
The	next	day	--	the	next	day	,	not	even	24	hours	had	passed	--	in	Peru	,	the	president	of	Peru	said	,	``	We	'll	do	250	.	''	And	boom	,	a	little	domino	effect	.
The	president	of	Rwanda	stepped	in	and	said	he	would	do	it	.
The	president	of	Ethiopia	said	he	would	do	it	.
And	boom	,	boom	,	boom	.	The	president	of	Mongolia	.
And	so	what	happens	is	,	these	things	start	to	happen	with	these	countries	--
still	not	enough	.
Add	up	all	those	countries	,	it	did	n't	quite	get	to	thing	,	so	we	said	,	``	Let	's	start	a	program	in	the	United	States	.	''	So	,	end	of	August	,	early	September	,	we	decide	to	do	this	.	We	announced	it	near	the	middle	,	end	--
just	when	the	Clinton	Initiative	was	taking	place	.
We	thought	that	was	a	good	time	to	announce	it	.
Launched	it	on	the	12	of	November	.
We	said	it	would	be	just	for	a	short	period	until	the	26	.	We	've	extended	it	until	the	31	.
And	the	``	Give	One	,	Get	One	''	program	is	really	important	because	it	got	a	lot	of	people	absolutely	interested	.
The	first	day	it	was	just	wild	.	And	then	we	said	,	``	Well	,	let	's	get	people	to	give	many	.	Not	just	one	,	and	get	one	,	but	maybe	give	100	,	give	1,000	.	''	And	that	's	where	you	come	in	.
And	that	's	where	I	think	it	's	very	important	.	I	do	n't	want	you	all	to	go	out	and	buy	400	dollars	worth	of	laptops	.	Okay	?	Do	it	,	but	that	's	not	going	to	help	.	Okay	?
If	everybody	in	this	room	goes	out	tonight	and	orders	one	of	these	things	for	400	dollars	,	whatever	it	is	,	300	people	in	the	room	doing	it	--	yeah	,	great	.
I	want	you	do	something	else	.
And	it	's	not	to	go	out	and	buy	100	or	1,000	,	though	,	I	invite	you	to	do	that	,	and	10,000	would	be	even	better	.
Tell	people	about	it	!	It	's	got	to	become	viral	,	OK	?
Use	your	mailing	lists	.	People	in	this	room	have	extraordinary	mailing	lists	.
Get	your	friends	to	give	one	,	get	one	.
And	if	each	one	of	you	sends	it	to	300	or	400	people	,	that	would	be	fantastic	.
I	wo	n't	dwell	on	the	pricing	at	all	.
Just	to	say	that	when	you	do	the	``	Give	One	,	Get	One	,	''	a	lot	of	press	is	a	bit	about	,	``	They	did	n't	make	it	,	it	's	188	dollars	,	it	's	not	100	.	''	It	will	be	100	in	two	years	.	It	will	go	below	100	.
We	've	pledged	not	to	add	features	,	but	to	bring	that	price	down	.
But	it	was	the	countries	that	wanted	it	to	go	up	,	and	we	let	them	push	it	up	for	all	sorts	of	reasons	.	So	what	you	can	do	--	I	've	just	said	it	.	Do	n't	just	give	one	,	get	one	.
I	just	want	to	end	with	one	last	one	.	This	one	is	not	even	The	first	kids	got	their	laptops	.	They	got	them	by	ship	,	and	I	'm	talking	now	about	7,000	,	8,000	at	a	time	went	out	this	week	.
They	went	to	Uruguay	,	Peru	,	Mexico	.
And	it	's	been	slow	coming	,	and	we	're	only	making	about	5,000	a	week	,	but	we	hope	,	we	hope	,	sometime	in	next	year	,	maybe	by	the	middle	of	the	year	,	to	hit	a	million	a	month	.	Now	put	that	number	,	and	a	million	is	n't	so	much	.	It	's	not	a	big	number	.
We	're	selling	a	billion	cell	phones	worldwide	this	year	.
But	a	million	a	month	in	laptop-land	is	a	big	number	.
