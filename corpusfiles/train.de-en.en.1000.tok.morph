It	can	be	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	thing	,	the	ocean	.
And	it	can	be	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	thing	,	what	human	health	is	.
And	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	two	together	might	seem	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 daunt 	 ing 	 	task	,	but	what	I	'm	going	to	try	to	say	is	that	even	in	that	 complex 	 ity 	 	,	there	's	some	simple	 theme 	 s 	 	that	I	think	,	if	we	understand	,	we	can	 re 	 ally 	 	move	forward	.
And	 t 	 hose 	 	simple	 theme 	 s 	 	are	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	 theme 	 s 	 	about	the	complex	science	of	what	's	going	on	,	but	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	all	 pre 	 tty 	 	well	know	.
And	I	'm	going	to	start	with	 th 	 is 	 	one	:	If	 mom 	 ma 	 	ai	n't	happy	,	ai	n't	 no 	 body 	 	happy	.
We	know	that	,	right	?	We	've	 experience 	 d 	 	that	.
And	if	we	just	take	that	and	we	build	from	there	,	then	we	can	go	to	the	next	step	,	which	is	that	if	the	ocean	ai	n't	happy	,	ai	n't	 no 	 body 	 	happy	.
That	's	the	theme	of	my	talk	.
And	we	're	making	the	ocean	 pre 	 tty 	 	 un 	 happy 	 	in	a	lot	of	different	ways	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	shot	of	 Can 	 nery 	 	Row	in	1932	.
 Can 	 nery 	 	Row	,	at	the	time	,	had	the	 big 	 gest 	 	industrial	canning	operation	on	the	west	coast	.
We	 pil 	 ed 	 	enormous	 amount 	 s 	 	of	 poll 	 ution 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	air	and	 in 	 to 	 	the	water	.
 Ro 	 lf 	 	 Bo 	 lin 	 	,	who	was	a	professor	at	the	 Hop 	 kin 	 	's	Marine	 St 	 ation 	 	where	I	work	,	wrote	in	the	1940s	that	``	The	 fum 	 es 	 	from	the	 s 	 cum 	 	 float 	 ing 	 	on	the	 in 	 lets 	 	of	the	 ba 	 y 	 	 we 	 re 	 	so	bad	they	 turn 	 ed 	 	 lead 	 - 	 based 	 	 paint 	 s 	 	black	.	''
People	 work 	 ing 	 	in	these	 can 	 n 	 eries 	 	could	 bare 	 ly 	 	stay	there	all	day	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	smell	,	but	you	know	what	they	came	out	 say 	 ing 	 	?
 The 	 y 	 	say	,	``	You	know	what	you	smell	?
You	smell	money	.	''
That	 poll 	 ution 	 	was	money	to	that	community	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	people	 deal 	 t 	 	with	the	 poll 	 ution 	 	and	 absorb 	 ed 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	skin	and	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	bodies	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 need 	 ed 	 	the	money	.
We	made	the	ocean	 un 	 happy 	 	;	we	made	people	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 happy 	 	,	and	we	made	them	 un 	 health 	 y 	 	.
The	 connect 	 ion 	 	between	ocean	health	and	human	health	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	based	 up 	 on 	 	 an 	 other 	 	couple	simple	 ad 	 age 	 s 	 	,	and	I	want	to	call	that	``	pinch	a	 min 	 now 	 	,	hurt	a	whale	.	''
The	pyramid	of	ocean	life	...
 N 	 ow 	 	,	when	an	ecologist	 look 	 s 	 	at	the	ocean	--	I	have	to	tell	you	--	we	look	at	the	ocean	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	different	way	,	and	we	see	different	 thing 	 s 	 	than	when	a	regular	person	 look 	 s 	 	at	the	ocean	 be 	 cause 	 	when	an	ecologist	 look 	 s 	 	at	the	ocean	,	we	see	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 interconnect 	 ions 	 	.
We	see	the	base	of	the	food	chain	,	the	plankton	,	the	small	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	we	see	how	 t 	 hose 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	are	food	to	 animal 	 s 	 	in	the	middle	of	the	pyramid	,	and	on	so	up	 th 	 is 	 	 dia 	 gram 	 	.
And	that	flow	,	that	flow	of	life	,	from	the	 ver 	 y 	 	base	up	to	the	 ver 	 y 	 	top	,	is	the	flow	that	 ecologist 	 s 	 	see	.
And	that	's	what	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	preserve	when	we	say	,	``	 Sav 	 e 	 	the	ocean	.	 He 	 al 	 	the	ocean	.	''
It	's	that	pyramid	.
 N 	 ow 	 	why	 do 	 es 	 	that	matter	for	human	health	?
 Be 	 cause 	 	when	we	jam	 thing 	 s 	 	in	the	bottom	of	that	pyramid	that	should	n't	be	there	,	some	 ver 	 y 	 	 frighten 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	happen	.
 Poll 	 ut 	 ants 	 	,	some	 pollutant 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 create 	 d 	 	by	us	:	 molecule 	 s 	 	like	 PC 	 B 	 s 	 	that	ca	n't	be	broken	down	by	our	bodies	.
And	they	go	in	the	base	of	that	pyramid	,	and	they	drift	up	;	they	're	 pass 	 ed 	 	up	that	way	,	on	to	 predator 	 s 	 	and	on	to	the	top	 predator 	 s 	 	,	and	in	so	 do 	 ing 	 	,	they	 accumul 	 ate 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	to	 br 	 ing 	 	that	home	,	I	thought	I	'd	invent	a	little	game	.
We	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	have	to	play	it	;	we	can	just	think	about	it	here	.
It	's	the	 Styro 	 foam 	 	and	chocolate	game	.
 Imagin 	 e 	 	that	when	we	got	on	 th 	 is 	 	boat	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	all	 give 	 n 	 	two	 Styro 	 foam 	 	 peanut 	 s 	 	.
Ca	n't	do	much	with	them	:	Put	them	in	your	pocket	.
 Sup 	 pose 	 	the	 rule 	 s 	 	are	:	every	time	you	 off 	 er 	 	 some 	 body 	 	a	drink	,	you	give	them	the	drink	,	and	you	give	them	your	 Styro 	 foam 	 	 peanut 	 s 	 	too	.
What	'll	happen	is	that	the	 Styro 	 foam 	 	 peanut 	 s 	 	will	start	moving	through	our	 socie 	 ty 	 	here	,	and	they	will	 accumul 	 ate 	 	in	the	 drunk 	 est 	 	,	 s 	 ting 	 iest 	 	people	.
There	's	no	 mechan 	 ism 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	game	for	them	to	go	 any 	 where 	 	but	 in 	 to 	 	a	 big 	 ger 	 	and	 big 	 ger 	 	pile	of	 in 	 digest 	 ible 	 	 Styro 	 foam 	 	 peanut 	 s 	 	.
And	that	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	 happen 	 s 	 	with	 PD 	 B 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	food	pyramid	:	 The 	 y 	 	 accumul 	 ate 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	top	of	it	.
 N 	 ow 	 	suppose	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 Styro 	 foam 	 	 peanut 	 s 	 	,	we	take	these	 love 	 ly 	 	little	 chocolate 	 s 	 	that	we	get	and	we	had	 t 	 hose 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	.
Well	,	some	of	us	would	be	eating	 t 	 hose 	 	 chocolate 	 s 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 pass 	 ing 	 	them	around	,	and	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 accumul 	 ating 	 	,	they	will	just	pass	 in 	 to 	 	our	group	here	and	not	 accumul 	 ate 	 	in	any	one	group	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	 absorb 	 ed 	 	by	us	.
And	that	's	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	a	 PC 	 B 	 	and	,	say	,	 some 	 thing 	 	natural	like	an	 o 	 mega 	 - 	 3 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	we	want	out	of	the	marine	food	chain	.
 PC 	 B 	 s 	 	 accumul 	 ate 	 	.
We	have	great	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	that	,	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	.
 PC 	 B 	 s 	 	 accumul 	 ate 	 	in	 dolphin 	 s 	 	in	 Sara 	 s 	 ota 	 	Bay	,	in	Texas	,	in	North	 Caro 	 lina 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	get	 in 	 to 	 	the	food	chain	.
The	 dolphin 	 s 	 	eat	the	fish	that	have	 PC 	 B 	 s 	 	from	the	plankton	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	 PC 	 B 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 ing 	 	 fat 	 - 	 soluble 	 	,	 accumul 	 ate 	 	in	these	 dolphin 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	a	dolphin	,	mother	dolphin	,	any	dolphin	--	there	's	 on 	 ly 	 	one	way	that	a	 PC 	 B 	 	can	get	out	of	a	dolphin	.
And	what	's	that	?
In	mother	's	milk	.
 He 	 re 	 	's	a	 dia 	 gram 	 	of	the	 PC 	 B 	 	load	of	 dolphin 	 s 	 	in	 Sara 	 s 	 ota 	 	Bay	.
Adult	 male 	 s 	 	:	a	huge	load	.
 Ju 	 ve 	 ni 	 les 	 	:	a	huge	load	.
 Fe 	 male 	 s 	 	after	 the 	 ir 	 	first	 ca 	 lf 	 	is	 al 	 ready 	 	 wean 	 ed 	 	:	a	lower	load	.
 T 	 hose 	 	 female 	 s 	 	,	they	're	not	 try 	 ing 	 	to	.
 T 	 hose 	 	 female 	 s 	 	are	 pass 	 ing 	 	the	 PC 	 B 	 s 	 	in	the	fat	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	mother	's	milk	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 off 	 spring 	 	,	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 off 	 spring 	 	do	n't	 surviv 	 e 	 	.
The	death	rate	in	these	 dolphin 	 s 	 	,	for	the	first	 ca 	 lf 	 	born	of	every	female	dolphin	,	is	60	to	80	percent	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	 mother 	 s 	 	pump	 the 	 ir 	 	first	 off 	 spring 	 	full	of	 th 	 is 	 	pollutant	,	and	most	of	them	die	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	the	mother	then	can	go	and	 re 	 produce 	 	,	but	what	a	 terr 	 ible 	 	price	to	pay	for	the	 accumul 	 ation 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	pollutant	in	these	 animal 	 s 	 	--	the	death	of	the	 first 	 - 	 born 	 	 ca 	 lf 	 	.
There	's	 an 	 other 	 	top	predator	in	the	ocean	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	.
That	top	predator	,	of	course	,	is	us	.
And	we	 al 	 so 	 	are	eating	meat	that	 come 	 s 	 	from	some	of	these	same	 place 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	whale	meat	that	I	 photograph 	 ed 	 	in	a	 grocer 	 y 	 	store	in	 To 	 kyo 	 	--	or	is	it	?
In	fact	,	what	we	did	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	was	learn	how	to	smuggle	a	 mole 	 cular 	 	biology	lab	 in 	 to 	 	 To 	 kyo 	 	and	use	it	to	 genetic 	 ally 	 	test	the	DNA	out	of	whale	meat	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	and	identify	what	they	 re 	 ally 	 	 we 	 re 	 	.
And	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	whale	meat	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	whale	meat	.
Some	of	them	 we 	 re 	 	 il 	 legal 	 	whale	meat	,	by	the	way	.
That	's	 an 	 other 	 	story	.
But	some	of	them	 we 	 re 	 	not	whale	meat	at	all	.
Even	 th 	 ough 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 label 	 ed 	 	whale	meat	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	dolphin	meat	.
Some	of	them	 we 	 re 	 	dolphin	liver	.	Some	of	them	 we 	 re 	 	dolphin	 blu 	 b 	 ber 	 	.
And	 t 	 hose 	 	dolphin	 part 	 s 	 	had	a	huge	load	of	 PC 	 B 	 s 	 	,	 dioxin 	 s 	 	and	heavy	 metal 	 s 	 	.
And	that	huge	load	was	 pass 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	people	that	ate	 th 	 is 	 	meat	.
It	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	a	lot	of	 dolphin 	 s 	 	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 s 	 old 	 	 a 	 s 	 	meat	in	the	whale	meat	market	around	the	world	.
That	's	a	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	for	 t 	 hose 	 	 population 	 s 	 	,	but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	for	the	people	eating	them	 be 	 cause 	 	they	do	n't	know	that	that	's	toxic	meat	.
We	had	these	data	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
I	remember	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	at	my	desk	 be 	 ing 	 	about	the	 on 	 ly 	 	person	in	the	world	who	 k 	 new 	 	that	whale	meat	 be 	 ing 	 	 s 	 old 	 	in	these	 market 	 s 	 	was	 re 	 ally 	 	dolphin	meat	,	and	it	was	toxic	.
It	had	 two 	 - 	 to 	 - 	 three 	 - 	 to 	 - 	 400 	 	 time 	 s 	 	the	toxic	 load 	 s 	 	ever	 allow 	 ed 	 	by	the	 E 	 PA 	 	.
And	I	remember	there	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	at	my	desk	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	Well	,	I	know	 th 	 is 	 	.	 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	great	scientific	 discover 	 y 	 	,	''	but	it	was	so	awful	.
And	for	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	time	in	my	scientific	 care 	 er 	 	,	I	broke	scientific	 proto 	 col 	 	,	which	is	that	you	take	the	data	and	publish	them	in	scientific	 journal 	 s 	 	and	then	begin	to	talk	about	them	.
We	 s 	 ent 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	polite	letter	to	the	 Mini 	 ster 	 	of	Health	in	Japan	and	 simpl 	 y 	 	 point 	 ed 	 	out	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 in 	 toler 	 able 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	,	not	for	us	,	but	for	the	people	of	Japan	 be 	 cause 	 	 mother 	 s 	 	who	may	be	 breast 	 feed 	 ing 	 	,	who	may	have	young	children	,	would	be	 buy 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	they	thought	was	 health 	 y 	 	,	but	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	toxic	.
That	led	to	a	whole	 s 	 eries 	 	of	other	 campaign 	 s 	 	in	Japan	,	and	I	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	proud	to	say	that	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	to	buy	 any 	 thing 	 	in	Japan	that	's	 label 	 ed 	 	 in 	 correct 	 ly 	 	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	they	're	still	selling	whale	meat	,	which	I	 believ 	 e 	 	they	should	n't	.
But	at	 l 	 east 	 	it	's	 label 	 ed 	 	 correct 	 ly 	 	,	and	you	're	no	 long 	 er 	 	going	to	be	 buy 	 ing 	 	toxic	dolphin	meat	 in 	 stead 	 	.
It	is	n't	just	there	that	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	,	but	in	a	natural	diet	of	some	 commun 	 ities 	 	in	the	Canadian	 arc 	 tic 	 	and	in	the	 Unit 	 ed 	 	 Stat 	 es 	 	and	in	the	European	 arc 	 tic 	 	,	a	natural	diet	of	 seal 	 s 	 	and	 whale 	 s 	 	 lead 	 s 	 	to	an	 accumul 	 ation 	 	of	 PC 	 B 	 s 	 	that	have	 gather 	 ed 	 	up	from	all	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	world	and	 end 	 ed 	 	up	in	these	women	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	women	have	toxic	breast	milk	.
 The 	 y 	 	can	not	feed	 the 	 ir 	 	 off 	 spring 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	children	,	 the 	 ir 	 	breast	milk	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 accumul 	 ation 	 	of	these	 toxin 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	food	chain	,	in	 the 	 ir 	 	part	of	the	world	's	ocean	pyramid	.
That	 mean 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 immun 	 e 	 	 system 	 s 	 	are	 com 	 promise 	 d 	 	.
It	 mean 	 s 	 	that	 the 	 ir 	 	children	's	 develop 	 ment 	 	can	be	 com 	 promise 	 d 	 	.
And	the	world	's	attention	on	 th 	 is 	 	over	the	last	decade	 ha 	 s 	 	 reduc 	 ed 	 	the	problem	for	these	women	,	not	by	changing	the	pyramid	,	but	by	changing	what	they	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	eat	out	of	it	.
We	've	taken	them	out	of	 the 	 ir 	 	natural	pyramid	in	order	to	solve	 th 	 is 	 	problem	.
That	's	a	good	thing	for	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	 a 	 cute 	 	problem	,	but	it	 do 	 es 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	solve	the	pyramid	problem	.
There	's	other	ways	of	 break 	 ing 	 	the	pyramid	.
The	pyramid	,	if	we	jam	 thing 	 s 	 	in	the	bottom	,	can	get	 back 	 ed 	 	up	like	a	 sew 	 er 	 	line	that	's	 clog 	 ged 	 	.
And	if	we	jam	 nutrient 	 s 	 	,	 sew 	 age 	 	,	 fertil 	 izer 	 	in	the	base	of	that	food	pyramid	,	it	can	back	up	all	through	it	.
We	end	up	with	 thing 	 s 	 	we	've	heard	about	before	:	red	 tide 	 s 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	which	are	 bloom 	 s 	 	of	toxic	 al 	 ga 	 e 	 	 float 	 ing 	 	through	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	 caus 	 ing 	 	 neuro 	 logical 	 	damage	.
We	can	 al 	 so 	 	see	 bloom 	 s 	 	of	bacteria	,	 bloom 	 s 	 	of	viruses	in	the	ocean	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	two	 shot 	 s 	 	of	a	red	tide	coming	on	shore	here	and	a	bacteria	in	the	 gen 	 us 	 	vibrio	,	which	 include 	 s 	 	the	 gen 	 us 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	cholera	in	it	.
How	 man 	 y 	 	people	have	 s 	 een 	 	a	``	beach	closed	''	sign	?
Why	 do 	 es 	 	that	happen	?
It	 happen 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	 jamm 	 ed 	 	so	much	 in 	 to 	 	the	base	of	the	natural	ocean	pyramid	that	these	bacteria	clog	it	up	and	 over 	 fill 	 	onto	our	 beach 	 es 	 	.
 Of 	 ten 	 	what	 jam 	 s 	 	us	up	is	 sew 	 age 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	have	ever	gone	to	a	state	park	or	a	national	park	where	you	had	a	big	sign	at	the	front	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	 C 	 lose 	 d 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	human	 sew 	 age 	 	is	so	far	over	 th 	 is 	 	park	that	you	ca	n't	use	it	''	?
Not	 ver 	 y 	 	often	.	We	would	n't	 toler 	 ate 	 	that	.
We	would	n't	 toler 	 ate 	 	our	 park 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 swamp 	 ed 	 	by	human	 sew 	 age 	 	,	but	 beach 	 es 	 	are	closed	a	lot	in	our	country	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	closed	more	and	more	and	more	all	around	the	world	for	the	same	reason	,	and	I	 believ 	 e 	 	we	should	n't	 toler 	 ate 	 	that	either	.
It	's	not	just	a	question	of	 clean 	 lines 	 s 	 	;	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	question	of	how	 t 	 hose 	 	 organism 	 s 	 	then	turn	 in 	 to 	 	human	disease	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	 vibrio 	 s 	 	,	these	bacteria	,	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	infect	people	.
 The 	 y 	 	can	go	 in 	 to 	 	your	skin	and	create	skin	 infect 	 ions 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	graph	from	 NO 	 AA 	 	's	ocean	and	human	health	 initi 	 ative 	 	,	 show 	 ing 	 	the	rise	of	the	 infect 	 ions 	 	by	vibrio	in	people	over	the	last	few	 year 	 s 	 	.
 Sur 	 fer 	 s 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	know	 th 	 is 	 	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	.
And	if	you	can	see	on	some	surfing	 s 	 ites 	 	,	in	fact	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	do	you	see	what	the	 wave 	 s 	 	are	like	or	what	the	weather	's	like	,	but	on	some	surf	rider	 s 	 ites 	 	,	you	see	a	little	 flash 	 ing 	 	poo	alert	.
That	 mean 	 s 	 	that	the	beach	might	have	great	 wave 	 s 	 	,	but	it	's	a	 danger 	 ous 	 	place	for	 surf 	 ers 	 	to	be	 be 	 cause 	 	they	can	carry	with	them	,	even	after	a	great	day	of	surfing	,	 th 	 is 	 	 leg 	 acy 	 	of	an	 infect 	 ion 	 	that	might	take	a	 ver 	 y 	 	long	time	to	solve	.
Some	of	these	 infect 	 ions 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 carry 	 ing 	 	 anti 	 biotic 	 	 resist 	 ance 	 	 gene 	 s 	 	now	,	and	that	 make 	 s 	 	them	even	more	difficult	.

 T 	 hose 	 	 bloom 	 s 	 	are	generating	other	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 chemical 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	just	a	simple	list	of	some	of	the	 type 	 s 	 	of	 poison 	 s 	 	that	come	out	of	these	 harm 	 ful 	 	 al 	 gal 	 	 bloom 	 s 	 	:	 shell 	 fish 	 	 poison 	 ing 	 	,	fish	 ci 	 gua 	 tera 	 	,	diarrheic	 shell 	 fish 	 	 poison 	 ing 	 	--	you	do	n't	want	to	know	about	that	--	 neuro 	 toxic 	 	 shell 	 fish 	 	 poison 	 ing 	 	,	 para 	 ly 	 tic 	 	 shell 	 fish 	 	 poison 	 ing 	 	.

 Cope 	 pods 	 	are	small	 crustacean 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	a	 tin 	 y 	 	fraction	of	an	inch	long	,	and	they	can	carry	on	 the 	 ir 	 	little	 leg 	 s 	 	some	of	the	cholera	bacteria	that	then	 lead 	 s 	 	to	human	disease	.

So	what	do	you	do	?
We	have	major	 problem 	 s 	 	in	 disrupt 	 ed 	 	 eco 	 system 	 	flow	that	the	pyramid	may	not	be	 work 	 ing 	 	so	well	,	that	the	flow	from	the	base	up	 in 	 to 	 	it	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 block 	 ed 	 	and	 clog 	 ged 	 	.
What	do	you	do	when	you	have	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	 disrupt 	 ed 	 	flow	?
Well	,	there	's	a	bunch	of	 thing 	 s 	 	you	could	do	.
You	could	call	 Jo 	 e 	 	the	 P 	 lumber 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
And	he	could	come	in	and	fix	the	flow	.
But	in	fact	,	if	you	look	around	the	world	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	are	there	hope	 spot 	 s 	 	for	where	we	may	be	able	to	fix	 problem 	 s 	 	,	there	have	 be 	 en 	 	 place 	 s 	 	where	 problem 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 fix 	 ed 	 	,	where	people	have	come	to	 grip 	 s 	 	with	these	 issue 	 s 	 	and	 beg 	 un 	 	to	turn	them	around	.
 Monte 	 re 	 y 	 	is	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	.
I	 start 	 ed 	 	out	 show 	 ing 	 	how	much	we	had	 di 	 stress 	 ed 	 	the	 Monte 	 re 	 y 	 	Bay	 eco 	 system 	 	with	 poll 	 ution 	 	and	the	canning	industry	and	all	of	the	 attend 	 ant 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	.
In	1932	,	that	's	the	picture	.
In	2009	,	the	picture	is	 dramat 	 ically 	 	different	.
The	 can 	 n 	 eries 	 	are	gone	.	The	 poll 	 ution 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 ab 	 ated 	 	.
But	there	's	a	 great 	 er 	 	sense	here	that	what	the	individual	 commun 	 ities 	 	need	is	 work 	 ing 	 	 eco 	 system 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	need	a	 function 	 ing 	 	pyramid	from	the	base	all	the	way	to	the	top	.
And	that	pyramid	in	 Monte 	 re 	 y 	 	,	right	now	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 effort 	 s 	 	of	a	lot	of	different	people	,	is	 function 	 ing 	 	better	than	it	's	ever	 function 	 ed 	 	for	the	last	150	 year 	 s 	 	.
It	did	n't	happen	 accident 	 ally 	 	.
It	 happen 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 man 	 y 	 	people	put	 the 	 ir 	 	time	and	effort	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 pioneer 	 ing 	 	spirit	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
On	the	left	there	,	Julia	Platt	,	the	mayor	of	my	little	 home 	 town 	 	in	Pacific	Grove	.
At	74	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	 be 	 came 	 	mayor	 be 	 cause 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	had	to	be	 d 	 one 	 	to	protect	the	ocean	.
In	1931	,	she	 produce 	 d 	 	California	's	first	 community 	 - 	 based 	 	marine	 protect 	 ed 	 	area	,	right	next	to	the	 big 	 gest 	 	polluting	 can 	 nery 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	Julia	 k 	 new 	 	that	when	the	 can 	 n 	 eries 	 	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	 we 	 re 	 	gone	,	the	ocean	 need 	 ed 	 	a	place	to	grow	from	,	that	the	ocean	 need 	 ed 	 	a	place	to	spark	a	seed	,	and	she	 want 	 ed 	 	to	provide	that	seed	.
Other	people	,	like	 D 	 avid 	 	 Pack 	 ard 	 	and	 Ju 	 lie 	 	 Pack 	 ard 	 	,	who	 we 	 re 	 	 instrument 	 al 	 	in	producing	the	 Monte 	 re 	 y 	 	Bay	 aqua 	 rium 	 	to	lock	 in 	 to 	 	people	's	 not 	 ion 	 	that	the	ocean	and	the	health	of	the	ocean	 eco 	 system 	 	 we 	 re 	 	just	 a 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	area	 a 	 s 	 	eating	the	 eco 	 system 	 	would	be	.
That	change	in	 think 	 ing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	led	to	a	 dramat 	 ic 	 	shift	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	in	the	 fortune 	 s 	 	of	 Monte 	 re 	 y 	 	Bay	,	but	other	 place 	 s 	 	around	the	world	.
Well	,	I	want	to	 leav 	 e 	 	you	with	the	thought	that	what	we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	here	is	protect	 th 	 is 	 	ocean	pyramid	,	and	that	ocean	pyramid	 connect 	 s 	 	to	our	own	pyramid	of	life	.
It	's	an	ocean	planet	,	and	we	think	of	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	terrestrial	species	,	but	the	pyramid	of	life	in	the	ocean	and	our	own	 live 	 s 	 	on	land	are	 intric 	 ate 	 ly 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	.
And	it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	through	 hav 	 ing 	 	the	ocean	 be 	 ing 	 	 health 	 y 	 	that	we	can	remain	 health 	 y 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
Thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
Let	's	start	with	day	and	night	.
Life	 evolv 	 ed 	 	under	 condition 	 s 	 	of	light	and	 dark 	 ness 	 	,	light	and	then	 dark 	 ness 	 	.
And	so	 plant 	 s 	 	and	 animal 	 s 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	internal	 clock 	 s 	 	so	that	they	would	be	ready	for	these	 change 	 s 	 	in	light	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	chemical	 clock 	 s 	 	,	and	they	're	found	in	every	known	 be 	 ing 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	two	or	more	 cell 	 s 	 	and	in	some	that	 on 	 ly 	 	have	one	cell	.
I	'll	give	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	--	if	you	take	a	 horse 	 shoe 	 	crab	off	the	beach	,	and	you	fly	it	all	the	way	 a 	 cross 	 	the	continent	,	and	you	drop	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	 slop 	 ed 	 	cage	,	it	will	scramble	up	the	floor	of	the	cage	 a 	 s 	 	the	tide	is	 ris 	 ing 	 	on	 it 	 s 	 	home	 shore 	 s 	 	,	and	it	'll	 s 	 kit 	 ter 	 	down	 aga 	 in 	 	right	 a 	 s 	 	the	water	is	 reced 	 ing 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 mile 	 s 	 	away	.
It	'll	do	 th 	 is 	 	for	 week 	 s 	 	,	 un 	 til 	 	it	kind	of	 gradu 	 ally 	 	 lose 	 s 	 	the	plot	.
And	it	's	 in 	 credible 	 	to	watch	,	but	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	 psych 	 ic 	 	or	 para 	 normal 	 	going	on	;	it	's	 simpl 	 y 	 	that	these	 crab 	 s 	 	have	internal	 cycle 	 s 	 	that	correspond	,	 usual 	 ly 	 	,	with	what	's	going	on	around	it	.
So	,	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	ability	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
And	in	 human 	 s 	 	,	we	call	it	the	``	body	clock	.	''
You	can	see	 th 	 is 	 	most	 clear 	 ly 	 	when	you	take	away	 some 	 one 	 	's	watch	and	you	shut	them	 in 	 to 	 	a	 bunk 	 er 	 	,	deep	 under 	 ground 	 	,	for	a	couple	of	 month 	 s 	 	.
People	 actual 	 ly 	 	volunteer	for	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	they	 usual 	 ly 	 	come	out	kind	of	 r 	 av 	 ing 	 	about	 the 	 ir 	 	productive	time	in	the	hole	.
So	,	no	matter	how	 a 	 typical 	 	these	 subject 	 s 	 	would	have	to	be	,	they	all	show	the	same	thing	.
 The 	 y 	 	get	up	just	a	little	bit	 lat 	 er 	 	every	day	--	say	15	 minute 	 s 	 	or	so	--	and	they	kind	of	drift	all	the	way	around	the	clock	like	 th 	 is 	 	over	the	course	of	the	 week 	 s 	 	.
And	so	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	we	know	that	they	are	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	internal	 clock 	 s 	 	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 some 	 how 	 	 sens 	 ing 	 	the	day	 out 	 side 	 	.
So	fine	,	we	have	a	body	clock	,	and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	it	's	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	in	our	 live 	 s 	 	.
It	's	a	huge	driver	for	culture	and	I	think	that	it	's	the	most	 under 	 rated 	 	force	on	our	behavior	.
We	 evolv 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	species	near	the	 equ 	 ator 	 	,	and	so	we	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 well 	 - 	 equi 	 pped 	 	to	deal	with	12	 hour 	 s 	 	of	 day 	 light 	 	and	12	 hour 	 s 	 	of	 dark 	 ness 	 	.
But	of	course	,	we	've	spread	to	every	corner	of	the	 glob 	 e 	 	and	in	 Arc 	 tic 	 	Canada	,	where	I	live	,	we	have	 perpetu 	 al 	 	 day 	 light 	 	in	summer	and	24	 hour 	 s 	 	of	 dark 	 ness 	 	in	winter	.
So	the	culture	,	the	 north 	 ern 	 	 ab 	 original 	 	culture	,	 tradition 	 ally 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 high 	 ly 	 	 season 	 al 	 	.
In	winter	,	there	's	a	lot	of	 sleep 	 ing 	 	going	on	;	you	enjoy	your	family	life	 in 	 side 	 	.
And	in	summer	,	it	's	 al 	 most 	 	 man 	 ic 	 	 hunt 	 ing 	 	and	 work 	 ing 	 	activity	 ver 	 y 	 	long	 hour 	 s 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	active	.
So	,	what	would	our	natural	rhythm	look	like	?
What	would	our	 sleep 	 ing 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	be	in	the	sort	of	ideal	sense	?
Well	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	when	people	are	living	 with 	 out 	 	any	sort	of	artificial	light	at	all	,	they	sleep	twice	every	night	.
 The 	 y 	 	go	to	bed	around	8:00	p.m	.
 un 	 til 	 	 mid 	 night 	 	and	then	 aga 	 in 	 	,	they	sleep	from	about	2:00	 a.m 	 . 	 	 un 	 til 	 	 s 	 un 	 rise 	 	.
And	 in 	 - 	 between 	 	,	they	have	a	couple	of	 hour 	 s 	 	of	sort	of	 medit 	 ative 	 	quiet	in	bed	.
And	 dur 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	time	,	there	's	a	 s 	 urge 	 	of	 pro 	 lac 	 tin 	 	,	the	 like 	 s 	 	of	which	a	modern	day	never	 s 	 ees 	 	.
The	people	in	these	 stud 	 ies 	 	report	 feel 	 ing 	 	so	awake	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	 day 	 time 	 	,	that	they	 real 	 ize 	 	they	're	 ex 	 peri 	 encing 	 	true	 wake 	 fulness 	 	for	the	first	time	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
So	,	cut	to	the	modern	day	.
We	're	living	in	a	culture	of	jet	lag	,	global	travel	,	24-hour	business	,	shift	work	.
And	you	know	,	our	modern	ways	of	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	have	 the 	 ir 	 	 advantage 	 s 	 	,	but	I	 believ 	 e 	 	we	should	understand	the	 cost 	 s 	 	.
Thank	you	.
 Adria 	 n 	 	 Kohl 	 er 	 	:	Well	,	we	're	here	 to 	 day 	 	to	talk	about	the	evolution	of	a	puppet	horse	.
 Bas 	 il 	 	 Jon 	 es 	 	:	But	 actual 	 ly 	 	we	're	going	to	start	 th 	 is 	 	evolution	with	a	hyena	.
AK	:	The	 ance 	 s 	 tor 	 	of	the	horse	.
 Oka 	 y 	 	,	we	'll	do	 some 	 thing 	 	with	it	.
The	hyena	is	the	 ance 	 s 	 tor 	 	of	the	horse	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	part	of	a	production	 call 	 ed 	 	``	Faustus	in	 Afri 	 ca 	 	,	''	a	 Hand 	 spring 	 	 Product 	 ion 	 	from	1995	,	where	it	had	to	play	draughts	with	Helen	of	 T 	 roy 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	production	was	 direct 	 ed 	 	by	South	African	artist	and	theater	director	,	William	Kentridge	.
So	it	 need 	 ed 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	articulate	front	paw	.
But	,	like	all	 puppet 	 s 	 	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	other	 attribut 	 es 	 	.
 B 	 J 	 	:	One	of	them	is	breath	,	and	it	kind	of	 breathe 	 s 	 	.
AK	:	Haa	haa	haaa	.
 B 	 J 	 	:	 Brea 	 th 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	for	us	.
It	's	the	kind	of	original	 move 	 ment 	 	for	any	puppet	for	us	 on 	 stage 	 	.
It	's	the	thing	that	 distinguish 	 es 	 	the	puppet	--	AK	:	Oops	.
 B 	 J 	 	:	From	an	 a 	 ctor 	 	.
 Pup 	 pet 	 s 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	have	to	try	to	be	 al 	 ive 	 	.
It	's	 the 	 ir 	 	kind	of	ur-story	 on 	 stage 	 	,	that	 de 	 s 	 per 	 ation 	 	to	live	.
AK	:	Yeah	,	it	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	a	dead	object	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	see	,	and	it	 on 	 ly 	 	 live 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	you	make	it	.
An	 a 	 ctor 	 	 struggle 	 s 	 	to	die	 on 	 stage 	 	,	but	a	puppet	 ha 	 s 	 	to	struggle	to	live	.
And	in	a	way	that	's	a	metaphor	for	life	.
 B 	 J 	 	:	So	every	moment	it	's	on	the	stage	,	it	's	making	the	struggle	.
So	we	call	 th 	 is 	 	a	piece	of	 emotion 	 al 	 	 engineer 	 ing 	 	that	uses	up-to-the-minute	17th	century	technology	--	to	turn	 no 	 un 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 verb 	 s 	 	.
AK	:	Well	 actual 	 ly 	 	I	prefer	to	say	that	it	's	an	object	 construct 	 ed 	 	out	of	wood	and	cloth	with	 move 	 ment 	 	built	 in 	 to 	 	it	to	 persuad 	 e 	 	you	to	 believ 	 e 	 	that	it	 ha 	 s 	 	life	.
 B 	 J 	 	:	 Oka 	 y 	 	so	.
AK	:	It	 ha 	 s 	 	 ear 	 s 	 	that	move	 pass 	 ively 	 	when	the	head	 go 	 es 	 	.
 B 	 J 	 	:	And	it	 ha 	 s 	 	these	bulkheads	made	out	of	 ply 	 wood 	 	,	 cover 	 ed 	 	with	fabric	--	 cur 	 iously 	 	similar	,	in	fact	,	to	the	 ply 	 wood 	 	 canoe 	 s 	 	that	 Adria 	 n 	 	's	father	used	to	make	when	he	was	a	boy	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 work 	 shop 	 	.
AK	:	In	Port	Elizabeth	,	the	village	 out 	 side 	 	Port	Elizabeth	in	South	 Afri 	 ca 	 	.
 B 	 J 	 	:	 Hi 	 s 	 	mother	was	a	 puppet 	 eer 	 	.
And	when	we	met	at	art	school	and	fell	in	love	in	1971	,	I	 hat 	 ed 	 	 puppet 	 s 	 	.
I	 re 	 ally 	 	thought	they	 we 	 re 	 	so	 be 	 neath 	 	me	.
I	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	an	 av 	 ant 	 - 	 gar 	 de 	 	artist	--	and	Punch	and	 Ju 	 dy 	 	was	 certain 	 ly 	 	not	where	I	 want 	 ed 	 	to	go	.
And	,	in	fact	,	it	took	about	10	 year 	 s 	 	to	discover	the	Bambara	Bamana	 puppet 	 s 	 	of	Mali	in	West	 Afri 	 ca 	 	,	where	there	's	a	fabulous	tradition	of	 puppet 	 ry 	 	,	to	learn	a	 renew 	 ed 	 	,	or	a	new	,	respect	for	 th 	 is 	 	art	form	.
AK	:	So	in	1981	,	I	 persuad 	 ed 	 	 Bas 	 il 	 	and	some	 friend 	 s 	 	of	mine	to	form	a	puppet	company	.
And	20	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	 miracul 	 ously 	 	,	we	 collabor 	 ated 	 	with	a	company	from	Mali	,	the	Sogolon	Marionette	Troupe	of	Bamako	,	where	we	made	a	piece	about	a	tall	giraffe	.
It	was	just	 call 	 ed 	 	``	Tall	 Hor 	 s 	 e 	 	,	''	which	was	a	 life 	 - 	 sized 	 	giraffe	.
 B 	 J 	 	:	And	here	 aga 	 in 	 	,	you	see	the	same	structure	.
The	bulkheads	have	now	 turn 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 hoop 	 s 	 	of	 can 	 e 	 	,	but	it	's	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	the	same	structure	.
It	's	got	two	people	 in 	 side 	 	it	on	 s 	 tilt 	 s 	 	,	which	give	them	the	height	,	and	 some 	 body 	 	in	the	front	who	's	using	a	kind	of	 steer 	 ing 	 	wheel	to	move	that	head	.
AK	:	The	person	in	the	hind	 leg 	 s 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	 controll 	 ing 	 	the	tail	,	a	bit	like	the	hyena	--	same	 mechan 	 ism 	 	,	just	a	bit	 big 	 ger 	 	.
And	he	's	 controll 	 ing 	 	the	ear	 move 	 ment 	 	.
 B 	 J 	 	:	So	 th 	 is 	 	production	was	 s 	 een 	 	by	Tom	Morris	of	the	National	 T 	 heat 	 re 	 	in	London	.
And	just	around	that	time	,	his	mother	had	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 Hav 	 e 	 	you	 s 	 een 	 	 th 	 is 	 	book	by	Michael	 Mor 	 pur 	 go 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	'War	 Hor 	 s 	 e 	 	'	?	''
AK	:	It	's	about	a	boy	who	 fall 	 s 	 	in	love	with	a	horse	.
The	horse	is	 s 	 old 	 	to	the	First	World	War	,	and	he	 join 	 s 	 	up	to	find	his	horse	.
 B 	 J 	 	:	So	Tom	 g 	 ave 	 	us	a	call	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Do	you	think	you	could	make	us	a	horse	for	a	show	to	happen	at	the	National	 T 	 heat 	 re 	 	?	''
AK	:	It	 seem 	 ed 	 	a	 love 	 ly 	 	idea	.
 B 	 J 	 	:	But	it	had	to	ride	.	It	had	to	have	a	rider	.
AK	:	It	had	to	have	a	rider	,	and	it	had	to	 particip 	 ate 	 	in	cavalry	 charge 	 s 	 	.
A	play	about	early	20th	century	 plow 	 ing 	 	technology	and	cavalry	 charge 	 s 	 	was	a	little	bit	of	a	 challeng 	 e 	 	for	the	 account 	 ing 	 	 depart 	 ment 	 	at	the	National	 T 	 heat 	 re 	 	in	London	.
But	they	 agree 	 d 	 	to	go	 a 	 long 	 	with	it	for	a	while	.
So	we	 beg 	 an 	 	with	a	test	.
 B 	 J 	 	:	 Th 	 is 	 	is	 Adria 	 n 	 	and	 Th 	 y 	 s 	 	Stander	,	who	went	on	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	design	the	 can 	 e 	 	system	for	the	horse	,	and	our	 next 	 - 	 door 	 	neighbor	 Ka 	 ther 	 ine 	 	,	 rid 	 ing 	 	on	a	 lad 	 der 	 	.
The	weight	is	 re 	 ally 	 	difficult	when	it	's	up	above	your	head	.
AK	:	And	once	we	put	 Ka 	 ther 	 ine 	 	through	that	 part 	 icular 	 	brand	of	hell	,	we	 k 	 new 	 	that	we	might	be	able	to	make	a	horse	,	which	could	be	ridden	.
So	we	made	a	model	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	 card 	 board 	 	model	,	a	little	bit	 small 	 er 	 	than	the	hyena	.
You	'll	notice	that	the	 leg 	 s 	 	are	 ply 	 wood 	 	 leg 	 s 	 	and	the	canoe	structure	is	still	there	.
 B 	 J 	 	:	And	the	two	 manipul 	 ators 	 	are	 in 	 side 	 	.
But	we	did	n't	 real 	 ize 	 	at	the	time	that	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	 need 	 ed 	 	a	third	manipulator	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	could	n't	 manipul 	 ate 	 	the	neck	from	 in 	 side 	 	and	walk	the	horse	at	the	same	time	.
AK	:	We	 start 	 ed 	 	work	on	the	prototype	after	the	model	was	approved	,	and	the	prototype	took	a	bit	 long 	 er 	 	than	we	 anticip 	 ated 	 	.
We	had	to	throw	out	the	 ply 	 wood 	 	 leg 	 s 	 	and	make	new	 can 	 e 	 	 one 	 s 	 	.
And	we	had	a	 crat 	 e 	 	built	for	it	.
It	had	to	be	 ship 	 ped 	 	to	London	.
We	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	test-drive	it	on	the	street	 out 	 side 	 	of	our	house	in	 Cap 	 e 	 	 T 	 own 	 	,	and	it	got	to	 mid 	 night 	 	and	we	had	n't	 d 	 one 	 	that	yet	.
 B 	 J 	 	:	So	we	got	a	camera	,	and	we	posed	the	puppet	in	 vari 	 ous 	 	 gall 	 op 	 ing 	 	stances	.
And	we	 s 	 ent 	 	it	off	to	the	National	 T 	 heat 	 re 	 	,	 hop 	 ing 	 	that	they	 believ 	 ed 	 	that	we	 create 	 d 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 work 	 ed 	 	.
AK	:	A	month	 lat 	 er 	 	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	there	in	London	with	 th 	 is 	 	big	box	and	a	studio	full	of	people	about	to	work	with	us	.
 B 	 J 	 	:	 Ab 	 out 	 	40	people	.
AK	:	We	 we 	 re 	 	 terr 	 ified 	 	.
We	 open 	 ed 	 	the	 li 	 d 	 	,	we	took	the	horse	out	,	and	it	did	work	;	it	 walk 	 ed 	 	and	it	was	able	to	be	ridden	.
 He 	 re 	 	I	have	an	18-second	clip	of	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	walk	of	the	prototype	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	in	the	National	 T 	 heat 	 re 	 	studio	,	the	place	where	they	cook	new	 idea 	 s 	 	.
It	had	by	no	 mean 	 s 	 	got	the	green	light	yet	.
The	 choreograph 	 er 	 	,	Toby	Sedgwick	,	 invent 	 ed 	 	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	sequence	where	the	baby	horse	,	which	was	made	out	of	 stick 	 s 	 	and	bits	of	 t 	 wig 	 s 	 	,	grew	up	 in 	 to 	 	the	big	horse	.
And	Nick	Starr	,	the	director	of	the	National	 T 	 heat 	 re 	 	,	saw	that	 part 	 icular 	 	moment	,	he	was	 stand 	 ing 	 	next	to	me	--	he	 near 	 ly 	 	wet	 him 	 self 	 	.
And	so	the	show	was	 give 	 n 	 	the	green	light	.
And	we	went	back	to	 Cap 	 e 	 	 T 	 own 	 	and	 re 	 designed 	 	the	horse	 complete 	 ly 	 	.
 He 	 re 	 	is	the	plan	.
And	here	is	our	 factor 	 y 	 	in	 Cap 	 e 	 	 T 	 own 	 	where	we	make	 horse 	 s 	 	.
You	can	see	 quit 	 e 	 	a	lot	of	 skeleton 	 s 	 	in	the	 back 	 ground 	 	there	.
The	 horse 	 s 	 	are	 complete 	 ly 	 	 hand 	 made 	 	.
There	is	 ver 	 y 	 	little	20th	century	technology	in	them	.
We	used	a	bit	of	laser	cutting	on	the	 ply 	 wood 	 	and	some	of	the	 a 	 lumin 	 um 	 	 piece 	 s 	 	.
But	 be 	 cause 	 	they	have	to	be	light	and	 flex 	 ible 	 	,	and	each	one	of	them	is	different	,	they	ca	n't	be	 mass 	 - 	 produce 	 d 	 	,	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	.
So	here	are	some	 half 	 - 	 finish 	 ed 	 	 horse 	 s 	 	ready	to	be	 work 	 ed 	 	in	London	.
And	now	we	would	like	to	 introduc 	 e 	 	you	to	 Jo 	 ey 	 	.
 Jo 	 ey 	 	boy	,	you	there	?
 Jo 	 ey 	 	.
 Jo 	 ey 	 	.
 Jo 	 ey 	 	,	come	here	.
No	,	no	,	I	have	n't	got	it	.
He	's	got	it	;	it	's	in	his	pocket	.
 B 	 J 	 	:	 Jo 	 ey 	 	.
AK	:	 Jo 	 ey 	 	,	 Jo 	 ey 	 	,	 Jo 	 ey 	 	,	 Jo 	 ey 	 	.
Come	here	.	 Stan 	 d 	 	here	where	people	can	see	you	.
Move	around	.	Come	on	.
I	'd	just	like	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	--	I	wo	n't	talk	too	loud	.	He	might	get	 irrit 	 ated 	 	.
 He 	 re 	 	,	Craig	is	 work 	 ing 	 	the	head	.
He	 ha 	 s 	 	 bi 	 cycle 	 	brake	 cable 	 s 	 	going	down	to	the	head	control	in	his	hand	.
 E 	 ach 	 	one	of	them	 oper 	 ates 	 	either	an	ear	,	 separat 	 e 	 ly 	 	,	or	the	head	,	up	and	down	.
But	he	 al 	 so 	 	 control 	 s 	 	the	head	 direct 	 ly 	 	by	using	his	hand	.
The	 ear 	 s 	 	are	 obvious 	 ly 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 emotion 	 al 	 	 indic 	 ator 	 	of	the	horse	.
When	they	point	right	back	,	the	horse	is	 fear 	 ful 	 	or	 ang 	 ry 	 	,	 depend 	 ing 	 	 up 	 on 	 	what	's	going	on	in	front	of	him	,	around	him	.
Or	,	when	he	's	more	 relax 	 ed 	 	,	the	head	 come 	 s 	 	down	and	the	 ear 	 s 	 	listen	,	either	side	.
Horses	'	 hear 	 ing 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
It	's	 al 	 most 	 	more	 import 	 ant 	 	than	 the 	 ir 	 	 eye 	 sight 	 	.
Over	here	,	 Tom 	 my 	 	's	got	what	you	call	the	heart	position	.
He	's	 work 	 ing 	 	the	leg	.
You	see	the	string	 tend 	 on 	 	from	the	hyena	,	the	hyena	's	front	leg	,	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	 pull 	 s 	 	the	hoop	up	.
Horses	are	so	 un 	 predict 	 able 	 	.
The	way	a	hoof	 come 	 s 	 	up	with	a	horse	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	 give 	 s 	 	you	the	 feel 	 ing 	 	that	it	's	a	convincing	horse	action	.
The	hind	 leg 	 s 	 	have	got	the	same	action	.
 B 	 J 	 	:	And	Mikey	 al 	 so 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	,	in	his	 finger 	 s 	 	,	the	ability	to	move	the	tail	from	left	to	right	,	and	up	and	down	with	the	other	hand	.
And	together	,	there	's	 quit 	 e 	 	a	complex	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	tail	 express 	 ion 	 	.
AK	:	You	want	to	say	 some 	 thing 	 	about	the	 breath 	 ing 	 	?
 B 	 J 	 	:	We	had	a	big	 challeng 	 e 	 	with	 breath 	 ing 	 	.
that	he	was	going	to	have	to	split	the	chest	of	the	puppet	in	two	and	make	it	breathe	like	that	--	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	how	a	horse	would	breathe	,	with	an	 expand 	 ed 	 	chest	.
But	we	 real 	 ized 	 	that	,	if	that	 we 	 re 	 	to	be	 happen 	 ing 	 	,	you	would	n't	,	 a 	 s 	 	an	audience	,	see	the	breath	.
So	he	made	a	channel	in	here	,	and	the	chest	 move 	 s 	 	up	and	down	in	that	channel	.
So	it	's	anti-naturalistic	 re 	 ally 	 	,	the	up	and	down	 move 	 ment 	 	,	but	it	 feel 	 s 	 	like	breath	.
And	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 be 	 cause 	 	all	that	 happen 	 s 	 	is	that	the	 puppet 	 eer 	 	 breathe 	 s 	 	with	his	 knee 	 s 	 	.
AK	:	Other	 emotion 	 al 	 	stuff	.
If	I	 we 	 re 	 	to	touch	the	horse	here	on	his	skin	,	the	heart	 puppet 	 eer 	 	can	shake	the	body	from	 in 	 side 	 	and	get	the	skin	to	quiver	.
You	'll	notice	,	of	course	,	that	the	puppet	is	made	out	of	 can 	 e 	 	lines	.
And	I	would	like	you	to	 believ 	 e 	 	that	it	was	an	aesthetic	choice	,	that	I	was	making	a	 three 	 - 	 dimensional 	 	 draw 	 ing 	 	of	a	horse	that	 some 	 how 	 	 move 	 s 	 	in	space	.
But	of	course	,	it	was	the	 can 	 e 	 	is	light	,	the	 can 	 e 	 	is	 flex 	 ible 	 	,	the	 can 	 e 	 	is	 dur 	 able 	 	and	the	 can 	 e 	 	is	moldable	.
And	so	it	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	practical	reason	why	it	was	made	of	 can 	 e 	 	.
The	skin	 it 	 self 	 	is	made	out	of	a	 see 	 - 	 through 	 	nylon	mesh	,	which	,	if	the	 light 	 ing 	 	 design 	 er 	 	 want 	 s 	 	the	horse	to	 al 	 most 	 	disappear	,	she	can	light	the	 back 	 ground 	 	and	the	horse	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	ghostlike	.
You	see	the	skeletal	structure	of	it	.
Or	if	you	light	it	from	above	,	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	more	solid	.
 Aga 	 in 	 	,	that	was	a	practical	 consider 	 ation 	 	.
The	 guy 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	the	horse	have	to	be	able	to	see	out	.
 The 	 y 	 	have	to	be	able	to	act	 a 	 long 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	fellow	 act 	 ors 	 	in	the	production	.
And	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	much	an	in-the-moment	activity	that	they	're	 engag 	 ed 	 	in	.
It	's	three	 head 	 s 	 	making	one	character	.
But	now	we	would	like	you	to	put	 Jo 	 ey 	 	through	some	 pace 	 s 	 	.
And	plant	.
Thank	you	.
And	now	just	--	All	the	way	from	 s 	 un 	 ny 	 	California	we	have	Zem	Joaquin	who	's	going	to	ride	the	horse	for	us	.
So	we	would	like	to	stress	that	the	performance	you	see	in	the	horse	is	three	 guy 	 s 	 	who	have	 stud 	 ied 	 	horse	behavior	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 thorough 	 ly 	 	.
 B 	 J 	 	:	Not	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	talk	to	one	 an 	 other 	 	while	they	're	 on 	 stage 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	mic	'd	.
The	sound	that	that	 ver 	 y 	 	large	chest	 make 	 s 	 	,	of	the	horse	--	the	whinnying	and	the	nickering	and	 every 	 thing 	 	--	that	 start 	 s 	 	 usual 	 ly 	 	with	one	 perform 	 er 	 	,	 car 	 ries 	 	on	with	a	second	person	and	 end 	 s 	 	with	a	third	.
AK	:	Mikey	Brett	from	 Leicester 	 s 	 hire 	 	.
Mikey	Brett	,	Craig	,	 Le 	 o 	 	,	Zem	Joaquin	and	 Bas 	 il 	 	and	me	.
Thank	you	.	Thank	you	.
I	want	to	help	you	 re 	 - 	 perceive 	 	what	 philanthro 	 py 	 	is	,	what	it	could	be	,	and	what	your	relationship	to	it	is	.
And	in	 do 	 ing 	 	that	,	I	want	to	 off 	 er 	 	you	a	vision	,	an	 imagin 	 ed 	 	future	,	if	you	will	,	of	how	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	poet	 Sea 	 mus 	 	 Hea 	 ney 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	put	it	,	``	 O 	 nce 	 	in	a	 life 	 time 	 	the	 long 	 ed 	 - 	 for 	 	 tid 	 al 	 	wave	of	justice	can	rise	up	,	and	hope	and	 histo 	 ry 	 	 rhym 	 e 	 	.	''
I	want	to	start	with	these	word	 pair 	 s 	 	here	.
We	all	know	which	side	of	these	we	'd	like	to	be	on	.
When	 philanthro 	 py 	 	was	 re 	 invent 	 ed 	 	a	century	ago	,	when	the	 found 	 ation 	 	form	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 invent 	 ed 	 	,	they	did	n't	think	of	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	on	the	wrong	side	of	these	either	.
In	fact	they	would	never	have	thought	of	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 a 	 s 	 	closed	and	set	in	 the 	 ir 	 	ways	,	 a 	 s 	 	 s 	 low 	 	to	respond	to	new	 challeng 	 es 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	small	and	 risk 	 - 	 a 	 verse 	 	.
And	in	fact	they	 we 	 re 	 	n't	.	 The 	 y 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 invent 	 ing 	 	 char 	 ity 	 	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 time 	 s 	 	,	what	 Rock 	 efeller 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	``	the	business	of	 benevol 	 ence 	 	.	''
But	by	the	end	of	the	20th	century	,	a	new	generation	of	 critic 	 s 	 	and	 reform 	 ers 	 	had	come	to	see	 philanthro 	 py 	 	just	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
The	thing	to	watch	for	 a 	 s 	 	a	global	 philanthro 	 py 	 	industry	 come 	 s 	 	about	--	and	that	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	--	is	how	the	 aspir 	 ation 	 	is	to	flip	these	old	 assumption 	 s 	 	,	for	 philanthro 	 py 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	open	and	big	and	fast	and	 connect 	 ed 	 	,	in	service	of	the	long	term	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 entrepreneur 	 ial 	 	energy	is	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	from	 man 	 y 	 	 quarter 	 s 	 	.
And	it	's	driven	and	 propel 	 led 	 	forward	by	new	 lead 	 ers 	 	,	like	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	people	here	,	by	new	 tool 	 s 	 	,	like	the	 one 	 s 	 	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	here	,	and	by	new	 pressure 	 s 	 	.
I	've	 be 	 en 	 	 follow 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	change	for	 quit 	 e 	 	a	while	now	,	and	 particip 	 ating 	 	in	it	.
 Th 	 is 	 	report	is	our	main	public	report	.
What	it	 tell 	 s 	 	is	the	story	of	how	 to 	 day 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	could	be	 a 	 s 	 	historic	 a 	 s 	 	100	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
What	I	want	to	do	is	share	some	of	the	 cool 	 est 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	going	on	with	you	.
And	 a 	 s 	 	I	do	that	,	I	'm	not	going	to	 d 	 well 	 	much	on	the	 ver 	 y 	 	large	 philanthro 	 py 	 	that	 every 	 body 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	 know 	 s 	 	about	--	the	 Gate 	 s 	 	or	the	 So 	 ros 	 	or	the	Google	.
 In 	 stead 	 	,	what	I	want	to	do	is	talk	about	the	 philanthro 	 py 	 	of	all	of	us	:	the	 democrat 	 ization 	 	of	 philanthro 	 py 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	moment	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	when	the	average	person	 ha 	 s 	 	more	power	than	at	any	time	.
What	I	'm	going	to	do	is	look	at	five	 categor 	 ies 	 	of	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	each	of	which	 challeng 	 es 	 	an	old	assumption	of	 philanthro 	 py 	 	.
The	first	is	mass	 collabor 	 ation 	 	,	 represent 	 ed 	 	here	by	Wikipedia	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	may	surprise	you	.
But	remember	,	 philanthro 	 py 	 	is	about	giving	of	time	and	talent	,	not	just	money	.

 N 	 ow 	 	,	all	of	these	big	 thing 	 s 	 	for	love	--	 experiment 	 s 	 	--	are	n't	going	to	take	off	.
But	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	do	are	going	to	be	the	 big 	 gest 	 	,	the	most	open	,	the	 fast 	 est 	 	,	the	most	 connect 	 ed 	 	form	of	 philanthro 	 py 	 	in	human	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
Second	 categor 	 y 	 	is	 on 	 line 	 	 philanthro 	 py 	 	 market 	 place 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	,	of	course	,	to	 philanthro 	 py 	 	what	 e 	 Bay 	 	and	Amazon	are	to	commerce	.
Think	of	it	 a 	 s 	 	 peer 	 - 	 to 	 - 	 peer 	 	 philanthro 	 py 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	 challeng 	 es 	 	yet	 an 	 other 	 	assumption	,	which	is	that	 organize 	 d 	 	 philanthro 	 py 	 	is	 on 	 ly 	 	for	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 wealth 	 y 	 	.
Take	a	look	,	if	you	have	n't	,	at	 Don 	 ors 	 Choos 	 e 	 	.
Omidyar	 Net 	 work 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	made	a	big	 invest 	 ment 	 	in	 Don 	 ors 	 Choos 	 e 	 	.

And	it	 go 	 es 	 	on	and	on	.
The	third	 categor 	 y 	 	is	 represent 	 ed 	 	by	 War 	 ren 	 	Buffet	,	which	I	call	 aggreg 	 ated 	 	giving	.
It	's	not	just	that	 War 	 ren 	 	Buffet	was	so	 amaz 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 gen 	 er 	 ous 	 	in	that	historic	act	last	summer	.
It	's	that	he	 challeng 	 ed 	 	 an 	 other 	 	assumption	,	that	every	giver	should	have	his	or	her	own	fund	or	 found 	 ation 	 	.
There	are	now	,	 to 	 day 	 	,	so	 man 	 y 	 	new	 fund 	 s 	 	that	are	 aggreg 	 ating 	 	giving	and	 invest 	 ing 	 	,	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	together	people	around	a	common	goal	,	to	think	 big 	 ger 	 	.

But	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 other 	 s 	 	:	New	 Pro 	 fit 	 	in	 Cam 	 bridge 	 	,	New	School	's	 Ven 	 ture 	 	Fund	in	Silicon	 Valle 	 y 	 	,	 Ven 	 ture 	 	 Phil 	 anthro 	 py 	 	Partners	in	 Wash 	 ington 	 	,	Global	Fund	for	Women	in	San	 Francis 	 co 	 	.
Take	a	look	at	these	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	 fund 	 s 	 	are	to	 philanthro 	 py 	 	what	venture	capital	,	private	 equ 	 ity 	 	,	and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	mutual	 fund 	 s 	 	are	to	 invest 	 ing 	 	,	but	with	a	twist	--	 be 	 cause 	 	often	a	community	 form 	 s 	 	around	these	 fund 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 ha 	 s 	 	at	 A 	 cum 	 en 	 	and	other	 place 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	imagine	for	a	second	these	first	three	 type 	 s 	 	of	 experiment 	 s 	 	:	mass	 collabor 	 ation 	 	,	 on 	 line 	 	 market 	 place 	 s 	 	,	 aggreg 	 ated 	 	giving	.
And	understand	how	they	help	us	 re 	 - 	 perceive 	 	what	 organize 	 d 	 	 philanthro 	 py 	 	is	.
It	's	not	about	 found 	 ations 	 	 necess 	 arily 	 	;	it	's	about	the	rest	of	us	.
And	imagine	the	 mash 	 - 	 up 	 	,	if	you	will	,	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	in	the	future	,	when	these	 thing 	 s 	 	come	together	in	the	 experiment 	 s 	 	of	the	future	--	imagine	that	 some 	 body 	 	 put 	 s 	 	up	,	say	,	100	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	for	an	inspiring	goal	--	there	 we 	 re 	 	21	 gift 	 s 	 	of	100	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	or	more	in	the	US	last	year	,	not	out	of	the	question	--	but	 on 	 ly 	 	 put 	 s 	 	it	up	if	it	's	 match 	 ed 	 	by	 million 	 s 	 	of	small	 gift 	 s 	 	from	around	the	 glob 	 e 	 	,	 there 	 by 	 	 engag 	 ing 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	people	,	and	building	 vis 	 ibility 	 	and	 engag 	 ing 	 	people	in	the	goal	that	's	 state 	 d 	 	.
I	'm	going	to	look	 quick 	 ly 	 	at	the	fourth	and	fifth	 categor 	 ies 	 	,	which	are	 innov 	 ation 	 	,	 com 	 petition 	 s 	 	and	social	 invest 	 ing 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	 bet 	 ting 	 	a	visible	 com 	 petition 	 	,	a	prize	,	can	attract	talent	and	money	to	some	of	the	most	difficult	 issue 	 s 	 	,	and	 there 	 by 	 	speed	the	solution	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 tackle 	 s 	 	yet	 an 	 other 	 	assumption	,	that	the	giver	and	the	 organ 	 ization 	 	is	at	the	center	,	 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	 put 	 ting 	 	the	problem	at	the	center	.
You	can	look	to	these	 innov 	 ators 	 	to	help	us	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	with	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 requir 	 e 	 	 techno 	 logical 	 	or	scientific	solution	.
That	 leav 	 es 	 	the	final	 categor 	 y 	 	,	social	 invest 	 ing 	 	,	which	is	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 any 	 way 	 	,	the	 big 	 gest 	 	of	them	all	,	 represent 	 ed 	 	here	by	 Xigi 	 .net 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	,	of	course	,	 tackle 	 s 	 	the	 big 	 gest 	 	assumption	of	all	,	that	business	is	business	,	and	 philanthro 	 py 	 	is	the	vehicle	of	people	who	want	to	create	change	in	the	world	.
Xigi	is	a	new	community	 s 	 ite 	 	that	's	built	by	the	community	,	 link 	 ing 	 	and	mapping	 th 	 is 	 	new	social	capital	market	.
It	 list 	 s 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	1,000	 ent 	 ities 	 	that	are	 off 	 er 	 ing 	 	debt	and	 equ 	 ity 	 	for	social	enterprise	.
So	we	can	look	to	these	 innov 	 ators 	 	to	help	us	remember	that	if	we	can	leverage	even	a	small	amount	of	the	capital	that	 seek 	 s 	 	a	return	,	the	good	that	can	be	driven	could	be	 astonish 	 ing 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	what	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	here	is	that	we	're	not	 think 	 ing 	 	our	way	 in 	 to 	 	a	new	way	of	 act 	 ing 	 	;	we	're	 act 	 ing 	 	our	way	 in 	 to 	 	a	new	way	of	 think 	 ing 	 	.
 Phil 	 anthro 	 py 	 	is	 re 	 organ 	 izing 	 	 it 	 self 	 	before	our	 ver 	 y 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	.
And	even	 th 	 ough 	 	all	of	the	 experiment 	 s 	 	and	all	of	the	big	 giver 	 s 	 	do	n't	yet	fulfill	 th 	 is 	 	 aspir 	 ation 	 	,	I	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	new	 zeitge 	 ist 	 	:	open	,	big	,	fast	,	 connect 	 ed 	 	,	and	,	let	us	 al 	 so 	 	hope	,	long	.
We	have	got	to	 real 	 ize 	 	that	it	is	going	to	take	a	long	time	to	do	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
If	we	do	n't	develop	the	 stam 	 ina 	 	to	stick	with	 thing 	 s 	 	--	 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	you	pick	,	stick	with	it	--	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	is	just	going	to	be	,	you	know	,	a	fad	.
But	I	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 hope 	 ful 	 	.
And	I	'm	 hope 	 ful 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 philanthro 	 py 	 	that	's	 re 	 organ 	 izing 	 	 it 	 self 	 	,	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	whole	other	 port 	 ions 	 	of	the	social	sector	,	and	of	business	,	that	are	 bus 	 y 	 	 challeng 	 ing 	 	``	business	 a 	 s 	 	usual	.	''
And	 every 	 where 	 	I	go	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	here	at	TED	,	I	feel	that	there	is	a	new	moral	 hung 	 er 	 	that	is	growing	.
What	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	is	people	 re 	 ally 	 	 wrestl 	 ing 	 	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	what	is	 th 	 is 	 	new	thing	that	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
 Word 	 s 	 	like	``	 philanthro 	 capital 	 ism 	 	,	''	and	``	natural	 capital 	 ism 	 	,	''	and	``	 philanthro 	 entrepreneur 	 	,	''	and	``	venture	 philanthro 	 py 	 	.	''
We	do	n't	have	a	language	for	it	yet	.
 What 	 ever 	 	we	call	it	,	it	's	new	,	it	's	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	and	I	think	it	's	gong	to	 quit 	 e 	 	significant	.
And	that	's	where	my	 imagin 	 ed 	 	future	 come 	 s 	 	in	,	which	I	am	going	to	call	the	social	 s 	 ing 	 ular 	 ity 	 	.
 Man 	 y 	 	of	you	will	 real 	 ize 	 	that	I	'm	 rip 	 ping 	 	a	bit	off	of	the	science	fiction	writer	 Ver 	 nor 	 	 V 	 ing 	 e 	 	's	 not 	 ion 	 	of	a	 techno 	 logical 	 	 s 	 ing 	 ular 	 ity 	 	,	where	a	number	of	 trend 	 s 	 	 accele 	 rate 	 	and	 converg 	 e 	 	and	come	together	to	create	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	a	 shock 	 ing 	 ly 	 	new	 re 	 ality 	 	.
It	may	be	that	the	social	 s 	 ing 	 ular 	 ity 	 	 a 	 head 	 	is	the	one	that	we	fear	the	most	:	a	 converg 	 ence 	 	of	 catastroph 	 es 	 	,	of	 environment 	 al 	 	degradation	,	of	 weapon 	 s 	 	of	mass	 destruct 	 ion 	 	,	of	 pan 	 demic 	 s 	 	,	of	poverty	.
That	's	 be 	 cause 	 	our	ability	to	confront	the	 problem 	 s 	 	that	we	face	 ha 	 s 	 	not	 ke 	 pt 	 	pace	with	our	ability	to	create	them	.
And	 a 	 s 	 	we	've	heard	here	,	it	is	no	 exagge 	 ration 	 	to	say	that	we	hold	the	future	of	our	 civil 	 ization 	 	in	our	 hand 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	never	before	.
The	question	is	,	is	there	a	positive	social	 s 	 ing 	 ular 	 ity 	 	?
 I 	 s 	 	there	a	 front 	 ier 	 	for	us	of	how	we	live	together	?
Our	future	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	to	be	 imagin 	 ed 	 	.
We	can	create	a	future	where	hope	and	 histo 	 ry 	 	 rhym 	 e 	 	.
But	we	have	a	problem	.
Our	experience	to	date	,	both	 individual 	 ly 	 	and	 collect 	 ively 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	prepared	us	for	what	we	're	going	to	need	to	do	,	or	who	we	're	going	to	need	to	be	.
We	are	going	to	need	a	new	generation	of	citizen	 lead 	 ers 	 	 will 	 ing 	 	to	commit	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	to	growing	and	changing	and	 learn 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 rapid 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	possible	.
That	's	why	I	have	one	last	thing	I	want	to	show	you	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	photograph	taken	about	100	 year 	 s 	 	ago	of	my	 grand 	 father 	 	and	 great 	 - 	 grand 	 father 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	 news 	 paper 	 	 publish 	 er 	 	and	a	 bank 	 er 	 	.
And	they	 we 	 re 	 	great	community	 lead 	 ers 	 	.
And	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	great	 philanthro 	 pist 	 s 	 	.
I	keep	 th 	 is 	 	photograph	close	by	to	me	--	it	's	in	my	 off 	 ice 	 	--	 be 	 cause 	 	I	've	 al 	 ways 	 	felt	a	 mystic 	 al 	 	 connect 	 ion 	 	to	these	two	men	,	both	of	whom	I	never	 k 	 new 	 	.
And	so	,	in	 the 	 ir 	 	honor	,	I	want	to	 off 	 er 	 	you	 th 	 is 	 	blank	slide	.
And	I	want	you	to	imagine	that	 th 	 is 	 	a	photograph	of	you	.
And	I	want	you	to	think	about	the	community	that	you	want	to	be	part	of	creating	.
 What 	 ever 	 	that	 mean 	 s 	 	to	you	.
And	I	want	you	to	imagine	that	it	's	100	 year 	 s 	 	from	now	,	and	your	 grand 	 child 	 	,	or	 great 	 - 	 grand 	 child 	 	,	or	niece	or	nephew	or	 god 	 - 	 child 	 	,	is	looking	at	 th 	 is 	 	photograph	of	you	.
What	is	the	story	you	most	want	for	them	to	tell	?
Thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
I	 believ 	 e 	 	that	there	are	new	,	 hid 	 den 	 	 tension 	 s 	 	that	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	between	people	and	 institution 	 s 	 	--	 institution 	 s 	 	that	are	the	 institution 	 s 	 	that	people	inhabit	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 dai 	 ly 	 	life	:	 school 	 s 	 	,	 hospital 	 s 	 	,	 work 	 place 	 s 	 	,	 factor 	 ies 	 	,	 off 	 ice 	 s 	 	,	etc	.
And	 some 	 thing 	 	that	I	see	 happen 	 ing 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	I	would	like	to	call	a	sort	of	``	 democrat 	 ization 	 	of	 in 	 timacy 	 	.	''
And	what	do	I	mean	by	that	?
I	mean	that	what	people	are	 do 	 ing 	 	is	,	in	fact	,	they	are	sort	of	,	with	 the 	 ir 	 	communication	 channel 	 s 	 	,	they	are	 break 	 ing 	 	an	 impose 	 d 	 	 isol 	 ation 	 	that	these	 institution 	 s 	 	are	 im 	 posing 	 	on	them	.
How	are	they	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	?	 The 	 y 	 	're	 do 	 ing 	 	it	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	way	,	by	 call 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	mom	from	work	,	by	 IM 	 ing 	 	from	 the 	 ir 	 	 off 	 ice 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 friend 	 s 	 	,	by	 text 	 ing 	 	under	the	desk	.
The	 picture 	 s 	 	that	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	me	are	people	that	I	 visit 	 ed 	 	in	the	last	few	 month 	 s 	 	.
And	I	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	to	come	 a 	 long 	 	with	the	person	they	communicate	with	most	.
And	 some 	 body 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	a	boyfriend	,	 some 	 body 	 	a	father	.
One	young	woman	 br 	 ought 	 	her	 grand 	 father 	 	.
For	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	I	've	 be 	 en 	 	looking	at	how	people	use	 channel 	 s 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	email	,	the	mobile	phone	,	 text 	 ing 	 	,	etc	.
What	we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	going	to	see	is	that	,	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	,	people	are	 commun 	 ic 	 ating 	 	on	a	regular	 bas 	 is 	 	with	five	,	six	,	seven	of	 the 	 ir 	 	most	 intima 	 te 	 	sphere	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	lets	take	some	data	.	Facebook	.
 Re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	some	 socio 	 logists 	 	from	Facebook	--	Facebook	is	the	channel	that	you	would	expect	is	the	most	 enlarg 	 en 	 ing 	 	of	all	 channel 	 s 	 	.
And	an	average	user	,	 s 	 aid 	 	 Cam 	 er 	 on 	 	 Mar 	 low 	 	,	from	Facebook	,	 ha 	 s 	 	about	120	 friend 	 s 	 	.
But	he	 actual 	 ly 	 	 talk 	 s 	 	to	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 two 	 - 	 way 	 	 ex 	 change 	 s 	 	with	,	about	four	to	six	people	on	a	regular	base	,	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	his	gender	.
 A 	 ca 	 demic 	 	research	on	instant	 mess 	 aging 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 show 	 s 	 	100	people	on	 bud 	 dy 	 	 list 	 s 	 	,	but	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	people	chat	with	two	,	three	,	four	--	 any 	 way 	 	,	less	than	five	.
My	own	research	on	 cell 	 phone 	 s 	 	and	voice	 call 	 s 	 	 show 	 s 	 	that	80	percent	of	the	 call 	 s 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	made	to	four	people	.	80	percent	.
And	when	you	go	to	 Sky 	 pe 	 	,	it	's	down	to	two	people	.
A	lot	of	 socio 	 logists 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	are	 quit 	 e 	 	 disappoint 	 ed 	 	.
I	mean	,	I	've	 be 	 en 	 	a	bit	 disappoint 	 ed 	 	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	when	I	saw	 th 	 is 	 	data	and	all	 th 	 is 	 	 deploy 	 ment 	 	,	just	for	five	people	.
And	some	 socio 	 logists 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	feel	that	it	's	a	closure	,	it	's	a	 cocoon 	 ing 	 	,	that	we	're	 dis 	 engag 	 ing 	 	from	the	public	.
And	I	would	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	I	would	like	to	show	you	that	if	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	look	at	who	is	 do 	 ing 	 	it	,	and	from	where	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	it	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	there	is	an	 in 	 credible 	 	social	 transform 	 ation 	 	.
There	are	three	 st 	 ories 	 	that	I	think	are	 quit 	 e 	 	good	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
The	first	 gentle 	 man 	 	,	he	's	a	 bake 	 r 	 	.
And	so	he	 start 	 s 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	every	 morn 	 ing 	 	at	four	 o 	 ' 	 clock 	 	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
And	around	eight	 o 	 ' 	 clock 	 	he	sort	of	 sneak 	 s 	 	away	from	his	oven	,	 clean 	 s 	 	his	 hand 	 s 	 	from	the	flour	and	 call 	 s 	 	his	wife	.
He	just	 want 	 s 	 	to	wish	her	a	good	day	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	the	start	of	her	day	.
And	I	've	heard	 th 	 is 	 	story	a	number	of	 time 	 s 	 	.
A	young	 factor 	 y 	 	 work 	 er 	 	who	 work 	 s 	 	night	 shift 	 s 	 	,	who	 manage 	 s 	 	to	sneak	away	from	the	 factor 	 y 	 	floor	,	where	there	is	 CC 	 TV 	 	by	the	way	,	and	find	a	corner	,	where	at	11	 o 	 ' 	 clock 	 	at	night	he	can	call	his	girlfriend	and	just	say	 good 	 night 	 	.
Or	a	mother	who	,	at	four	 o 	 ' 	 clock 	 	,	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 manage 	 s 	 	to	find	a	corner	in	the	toilet	to	check	that	her	children	are	 safe 	 ly 	 	home	.
 Th 	 en 	 	there	is	 an 	 other 	 	couple	,	there	is	a	 Brazil 	 ian 	 	couple	.
 The 	 y 	 	've	lived	in	 It 	 a 	 ly 	 	for	a	number	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	 Sky 	 pe 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	a	few	 time 	 s 	 	a	week	.
But	once	a	 fort 	 night 	 	,	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	put	the	computer	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 din 	 ing 	 	table	,	pull	out	the	 web 	 cam 	 	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	 d 	 inner 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	family	in	 Sa 	 o 	 	 Paul 	 o 	 	.	And	they	have	a	big	event	of	it	.
And	I	heard	 th 	 is 	 	story	the	first	time	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	from	a	 ver 	 y 	 	modest	family	of	 im 	 migrant 	 s 	 	from	Kosovo	in	 Switzer 	 land 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	had	set	up	a	big	screen	in	 the 	 ir 	 	living	room	,	and	every	 morn 	 ing 	 	they	had	 break 	 fast 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 grand 	 mother 	 	.
But	 Dan 	 ny 	 	 Mill 	 er 	 	,	who	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 anthropo 	 logist 	 	who	is	 work 	 ing 	 	on	Filipina	migrant	women	who	 leav 	 e 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	children	back	in	the	 Philip 	 pine 	 s 	 	,	was	 tell 	 ing 	 	me	about	how	much	 parent 	 ing 	 	is	going	on	through	 Sky 	 pe 	 	,	and	how	much	these	 mother 	 s 	 	are	 engag 	 ed 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	children	through	 Sky 	 pe 	 	.
And	then	there	is	the	third	couple	.	 The 	 y 	 	are	two	 friend 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	chat	to	each	other	every	day	,	a	few	 time 	 s 	 	a	day	 actual 	 ly 	 	.
And	 final 	 ly 	 	,	 final 	 ly 	 	,	they	've	 manage 	 d 	 	to	put	instant	 mess 	 aging 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	at	work	.
And	now	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	they	have	it	open	.
 When 	 ever 	 	they	have	a	moment	they	chat	to	each	other	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	with	 teenager 	 s 	 	and	 kid 	 s 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	it	in	school	,	under	the	table	,	and	 text 	 ing 	 	under	the	table	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 friend 	 s 	 	.
So	,	 non 	 e 	 	of	these	 case 	 s 	 	are	 un 	 ique 	 	.
I	mean	,	I	could	tell	you	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	them	.
But	what	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 exception 	 al 	 	is	the	setting	.
So	,	think	of	the	three	 setting 	 s 	 	I	've	 talk 	 ed 	 	to	you	about	:	 factor 	 y 	 	,	 migr 	 ation 	 	,	 off 	 ice 	 	.
But	it	could	be	in	a	school	,	it	could	be	an	 administr 	 ation 	 	,	it	could	be	a	hospital	.
Three	 setting 	 s 	 	that	,	if	we	just	step	back	15	 year 	 s 	 	,	if	you	just	think	back	15	 year 	 s 	 	,	when	you	 clock 	 ed 	 	in	,	when	you	 clock 	 ed 	 	in	to	an	 off 	 ice 	 	,	when	you	 clock 	 ed 	 	in	to	a	 factor 	 y 	 	,	there	was	no	contact	for	the	whole	 dur 	 ation 	 	of	the	time	,	there	was	no	contact	with	your	private	sphere	.
If	you	 we 	 re 	 	 luck 	 y 	 	there	was	a	public	phone	 hang 	 ing 	 	in	the	corridor	or	 some 	 where 	 	.
If	you	 we 	 re 	 	in	management	,	oh	,	that	was	a	different	story	.
 May 	 be 	 	you	had	a	direct	line	.
If	you	 we 	 re 	 	not	,	you	 may 	 be 	 	had	to	go	through	an	 oper 	 ator 	 	.
But	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	when	you	 walk 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 building 	 s 	 	,	the	private	sphere	was	left	 be 	 hind 	 	you	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	a	norm	of	our	professional	 live 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	a	norm	and	 s 	 uch 	 	an	 expect 	 ation 	 	.
And	it	had	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	technical	 cap 	 ability 	 	.
The	 phone 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	there	.	But	the	 expect 	 ation 	 	was	once	you	 move 	 d 	 	in	there	your	 commit 	 ment 	 	was	fully	to	the	task	at	hand	,	fully	to	the	people	around	you	.
That	was	where	the	focus	had	to	be	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	a	cultural	norm	that	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	school	our	children	for	them	to	be	 cap 	 able 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	 clea 	 vage 	 	.
If	you	think	 nurse 	 ry 	 	,	 kind 	 ergarten 	 	,	first	 year 	 s 	 	of	school	are	just	 dedicate 	 d 	 	to	take	away	the	children	,	to	make	them	used	to	 stay 	 ing 	 	long	 hour 	 s 	 	away	from	 the 	 ir 	 	family	.
And	then	the	school	 enact 	 s 	 	 perfect 	 ly 	 	well	.
It	 mimic 	 s 	 	 perfect 	 ly 	 	all	the	 ritual 	 s 	 	that	we	will	find	in	 off 	 ice 	 s 	 	:	 ritual 	 s 	 	of	entry	,	 ritual 	 s 	 	of	exit	,	the	 schedule 	 s 	 	,	the	 uniform 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	,	 thing 	 s 	 	that	identify	you	,	 team 	 - 	 building 	 	 activ 	 ities 	 	,	team	building	that	will	allow	you	to	 bas 	 ically 	 	be	with	a	random	group	of	 kid 	 s 	 	,	or	a	random	group	of	people	that	you	will	have	to	be	with	for	a	number	of	time	.
And	of	course	,	the	major	thing	:	learn	to	pay	attention	,	to	 concent 	 rate 	 	and	focus	your	attention	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	about	150	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
It	 on 	 ly 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	with	the	birth	of	modern	 bureau 	 cracy 	 	,	and	of	industrial	revolution	.
When	people	 bas 	 ically 	 	had	to	go	 some 	 where 	 	else	to	work	and	carry	out	the	work	.
And	when	with	modern	 bureau 	 cracy 	 	there	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	rational	approach	,	where	there	was	a	clear	 distinct 	 ion 	 	between	the	private	sphere	and	the	public	sphere	.
So	,	 un 	 til 	 	then	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	people	 we 	 re 	 	living	on	top	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 trade 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	 we 	 re 	 	living	on	top	of	the	land	they	 we 	 re 	 	 labor 	 ing 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	 we 	 re 	 	living	on	top	of	the	 work 	 shop 	 s 	 	where	they	 we 	 re 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	.
And	if	you	think	,	it	's	 permeate 	 d 	 	our	whole	culture	,	even	our	cities	.
If	you	think	of	 med 	 ieval 	 	cities	,	 med 	 ieval 	 	cities	the	 bo 	 rough 	 s 	 	all	have	the	 name 	 s 	 	of	the	 guild 	 s 	 	and	 profession 	 s 	 	that	lived	there	.
 N 	 ow 	 	we	have	 sprawl 	 ing 	 	 resident 	 ial 	 	 suburb 	 ia 	 s 	 	that	are	well	distinct	from	production	 area 	 s 	 	and	commercial	 area 	 s 	 	.
And	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	over	these	150	 year 	 s 	 	,	there	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	clear	class	system	that	 al 	 so 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 emerge 	 d 	 	.
So	the	lower	the	 stat 	 us 	 	of	the	job	and	of	the	person	 carry 	 ing 	 	out	,	the	more	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	he	would	be	from	his	personal	sphere	.
People	have	taken	 th 	 is 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	in	contact	all	through	the	day	or	in	all	 type 	 s 	 	of	 situ 	 ations 	 	.
And	they	are	 do 	 ing 	 	it	 massive 	 ly 	 	.
The	 Pe 	 w 	 	Institute	,	which	 produce 	 s 	 	good	data	on	a	regular	 bas 	 is 	 	on	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	in	the	 Stat 	 es 	 	,	 say 	 s 	 	that	--	and	I	think	that	 th 	 is 	 	number	is	 conserv 	 ative 	 	--	50	percent	of	 any 	 body 	 	with	email	access	at	work	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	private	email	from	his	 off 	 ice 	 	.
I	 re 	 ally 	 	think	that	the	number	is	 conserv 	 ative 	 	.
In	my	own	research	,	we	saw	that	the	peak	for	private	email	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	11	 o 	 ' 	 clock 	 	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	 what 	 ever 	 	the	country	.
75	percent	of	people	admit	 do 	 ing 	 	private	 conversation 	 s 	 	from	work	on	 the 	 ir 	 	mobile	 phone 	 s 	 	.
100	percent	are	using	text	.
The	point	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 - 	 appropri 	 ation 	 	of	the	personal	sphere	is	not	 terr 	 ibly 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	with	all	 institution 	 s 	 	.
I	'm	 al 	 ways 	 	 surprise 	 d 	 	the	U.S.	 Arm 	 y 	 	 socio 	 logists 	 	are	 discuss 	 ing 	 	of	the	impact	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	of	 soldier 	 s 	 	in	Iraq	 hav 	 ing 	 	 dai 	 ly 	 	contact	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	.
But	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 institution 	 s 	 	that	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 block 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	access	.
And	every	day	,	every	single	day	,	I	read	news	that	 make 	 s 	 	me	 cr 	 ing 	 e 	 	,	like	a	$	15	fine	to	 kid 	 s 	 	in	Texas	,	for	using	,	every	time	they	take	out	 the 	 ir 	 	mobile	phone	in	school	.
 Im 	 mediate 	 	 dismiss 	 al 	 	to	bus	 driver 	 s 	 	in	New	York	,	if	 s 	 een 	 	with	a	mobile	phone	in	a	hand	.
 Comp 	 anie 	 s 	 	 block 	 ing 	 	access	to	IM	or	to	Facebook	.
 Be 	 hind 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	of	security	and	 safe 	 ty 	 	,	which	have	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	the	 argument 	 s 	 	for	social	control	,	in	fact	what	is	going	on	is	that	these	 institution 	 s 	 	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	decide	who	,	in	fact	,	 ha 	 s 	 	a	right	to	self	determine	 the 	 ir 	 	attention	,	to	decide	,	 whet 	 her 	 	they	should	,	or	not	,	be	 isolate 	 d 	 	.
And	they	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	block	,	in	a	certain	sense	,	 th 	 is 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	of	a	 great 	 er 	 	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	 in 	 timacy 	 	.
So	 to 	 day 	 	,	I	'm	going	to	tell	you	about	some	people	who	did	n't	move	out	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 neighbor 	 hood 	 s 	 	.
The	first	one	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	right	here	in	 Chi 	 cago 	 	.
 Bren 	 da 	 	 Palm 	 s 	 - 	 Far 	 ber 	 	was	 hire 	 d 	 	to	help	 ex 	 - 	 convict 	 s 	 	 re 	 enter 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	and	keep	them	from	going	back	 in 	 to 	 	 pri 	 son 	 	.
 Current 	 ly 	 	,	 taxpayer 	 s 	 	 s 	 pend 	 	about	60,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	per	year	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	a	person	to	jail	.
We	know	that	 two 	 - 	 third 	 s 	 	of	them	are	going	to	go	back	.
I	find	it	 interest 	 ing 	 	that	,	for	every	one	dollar	we	 s 	 pend 	 	,	 how 	 ever 	 	,	on	early	 child 	 hood 	 	education	,	like	Head	Start	,	we	 s 	 ave 	 	17	 dollar 	 s 	 	on	stuff	like	 incarce 	 ration 	 	in	the	future	.
Or	--	think	about	it	--	that	60,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	is	more	than	what	it	 cost 	 s 	 	to	 s 	 end 	 	one	person	to	Harvard	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
But	 Bren 	 da 	 	,	not	 be 	 ing 	 	 phase 	 d 	 	by	stuff	like	that	,	took	a	look	at	her	 challeng 	 e 	 	and	came	up	with	a	 not 	 - 	 so 	 - 	 obvious 	 	solution	:	create	a	business	that	 produce 	 s 	 	skin	care	 product 	 s 	 	from	honey	.
 Oka 	 y 	 	,	it	might	be	obvious	to	some	of	you	;	it	was	n't	to	me	.
It	's	the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	growing	a	form	of	social	 innov 	 ation 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	real	potential	.
She	 hire 	 d 	 	 seem 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 un 	 employ 	 able 	 	men	and	women	to	care	for	the	bees	,	harvest	the	honey	and	make	 value 	 - 	 add 	 ed 	 	 product 	 s 	 	that	they	 market 	 ed 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	and	that	 we 	 re 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	 s 	 old 	 	at	 W 	 hole 	 	 Food 	 s 	 	.
She	 combine 	 d 	 	 employ 	 ment 	 	experience	and	training	with	life	 skill 	 s 	 	they	 need 	 ed 	 	,	like	 anger 	 - 	 management 	 	and	 team 	 work 	 	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	how	to	talk	to	future	 employ 	 ers 	 	about	how	 the 	 ir 	 	 experience 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 demonst 	 rated 	 	the	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	that	they	had	 learn 	 ed 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 eager 	 ness 	 	to	learn	more	.
 Les 	 s 	 	than	four	percent	of	the	 folk 	 s 	 	that	went	through	her	program	 actual 	 ly 	 	go	back	to	jail	.
So	these	young	men	and	women	 learn 	 ed 	 	 job 	 - 	 read 	 iness 	 	and	life	 skill 	 s 	 	through	bee	 keep 	 ing 	 	and	 be 	 came 	 	productive	 citizen 	 s 	 	in	the	process	.
Talk	about	a	sweet	 begin 	 ning 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	I	'm	going	to	take	you	to	 Lo 	 s 	 	 Angel 	 es 	 	,	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	people	know	that	 L. 	 A. 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	.
But	I	'm	going	to	talk	about	 L. 	 A. 	 	's	water	 issue 	 s 	 	right	now	.
 The 	 y 	 	have	not	 en 	 ough 	 	water	on	most	 day 	 s 	 	and	too	much	to	handle	when	it	 rain 	 s 	 	.
 Current 	 ly 	 	,	20	percent	of	California	's	energy	consumption	is	used	to	pump	water	 in 	 to 	 	 most 	 ly 	 	 South 	 ern 	 	California	.
 T 	 heir 	 	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	 load 	 s 	 	,	 load 	 s 	 	,	to	channel	that	 rain 	 water 	 	out	 in 	 to 	 	the	ocean	when	it	 rain 	 s 	 	and	 flood 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
 N 	 ow 	 	 And 	 y 	 	 Lip 	 ki 	 s 	 	is	 work 	 ing 	 	to	help	 L. 	 A. 	 	cut	 infra 	 structure 	 	 cost 	 s 	 	 associate 	 d 	 	with	water	management	and	urban	heat	 is 	 land 	 	--	 link 	 ing 	 	 tree 	 s 	 	,	people	and	technology	to	create	a	more	 liv 	 able 	 	city	.
All	that	green	stuff	 actual 	 ly 	 	 natural 	 ly 	 	 absorb 	 s 	 	storm	water	,	 al 	 so 	 	 help 	 s 	 	cool	our	cities	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	,	come	to	think	about	it	,	do	you	 re 	 ally 	 	want	 air 	 - 	 condition 	 ing 	 	,	or	is	it	a	 cool 	 er 	 	room	that	you	want	?
How	you	get	it	should	n't	make	that	much	of	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
So	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 L. 	 A. 	 	 Count 	 y 	 	 decide 	 d 	 	that	they	 need 	 ed 	 	to	 s 	 pend 	 	2.5	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	to	repair	the	city	 school 	 s 	 	.
And	 And 	 y 	 	and	his	team	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	 s 	 pend 	 	200	million	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 dollar 	 s 	 	on	asphalt	to	surround	the	 school 	 s 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
And	by	 present 	 ing 	 	a	 re 	 ally 	 	strong	economic	case	,	they	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	the	 L. 	 A. 	 	government	that	 re 	 placing 	 	that	asphalt	with	 tree 	 s 	 	and	other	 green 	 ery 	 	,	that	the	 school 	 s 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	would	 s 	 ave 	 	the	system	more	on	energy	than	they	 s 	 pend 	 	on	 horti 	 cultural 	 	 infra 	 structure 	 	.
So	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	,	20	million	square	feet	of	asphalt	was	 replace 	 d 	 	or	 avoid 	 ed 	 	,	and	 electric 	 al 	 	consumption	for	 air 	 - 	 condition 	 ing 	 	went	down	,	while	 employ 	 ment 	 	for	people	to	maintain	 t 	 hose 	 	 ground 	 s 	 	went	up	,	 result 	 ing 	 	in	a	 net 	 - 	 saving 	 s 	 	to	the	system	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	 health 	 ier 	 	 student 	 s 	 	and	 school 	 s 	 	system	 employ 	 ees 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
 N 	 ow 	 	 Ju 	 dy 	 	 Bond 	 s 	 	is	a	coal	 min 	 er 	 	's	daughter	.
Her	family	 ha 	 s 	 	eight	 generation 	 s 	 	in	a	town	 call 	 ed 	 	 White 	 s 	 ville 	 	,	West	 Virgin 	 ia 	 	.
And	if	 any 	 one 	 	should	be	 cl 	 ing 	 ing 	 	to	the	 form 	 er 	 	 glor 	 y 	 	of	the	coal	 min 	 ing 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	and	of	the	town	,	it	should	be	 Ju 	 dy 	 	.
But	the	way	coal	is	 min 	 ed 	 	right	now	is	different	from	the	deep	 mine 	 s 	 	that	her	father	and	her	father	's	father	would	go	down	 in 	 to 	 	and	that	 employ 	 ed 	 	 essential 	 ly 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	and	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	two	dozen	men	can	tear	down	a	mountain	in	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 month 	 s 	 	,	and	 on 	 ly 	 	for	about	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	'	worth	of	coal	.
That	kind	of	technology	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 mountain 	 top 	 	removal	.	''
It	can	make	a	mountain	go	from	 th 	 is 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	in	a	few	short	 month 	 s 	 	.
Just	imagine	that	the	air	 surround 	 ing 	 	these	 place 	 s 	 	--	it	's	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	the	residue	of	 explosive 	 s 	 	and	coal	.
When	we	 visit 	 ed 	 	,	it	 g 	 ave 	 	some	of	the	people	we	 we 	 re 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	strange	little	cough	after	 be 	 ing 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	there	for	just	a	few	 hour 	 s 	 	or	so	--	not	just	 min 	 ers 	 	,	but	 every 	 body 	 	.
And	 Ju 	 dy 	 	saw	her	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 destroy 	 ed 	 	and	her	water	 poison 	 ed 	 	.
And	the	coal	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	just	move	on	after	the	mountain	was	 empti 	 ed 	 	,	 leav 	 ing 	 	even	more	 un 	 employ 	 ment 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	wake	.
But	she	 al 	 so 	 	saw	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	in	potential	wind	energy	on	an	 in 	 tact 	 	mountain	,	and	one	that	was	 reduc 	 ed 	 	in	 elev 	 ation 	 	by	over	2,000	feet	.
Three	 year 	 s 	 	of	 dirt 	 y 	 	energy	with	not	 man 	 y 	 	 job 	 s 	 	,	or	centuries	of	clean	energy	with	the	potential	for	 develop 	 ing 	 	 expert 	 ise 	 	and	 improve 	 ments 	 	in	efficiency	based	on	technical	 skill 	 s 	 	,	and	 develop 	 ing 	 	local	knowledge	about	how	to	get	the	most	out	of	that	region	's	wind	.
She	 calcul 	 ated 	 	the	 up 	 - 	 front 	 	cost	and	the	 pay 	 back 	 	over	time	,	and	it	's	a	 net 	 - 	 plus 	 	on	so	 man 	 y 	 	 level 	 s 	 	for	the	local	,	national	and	global	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
It	's	a	 long 	 er 	 	 pay 	 back 	 	than	 mountain 	 top 	 	removal	,	but	the	wind	energy	 actual 	 ly 	 	 pay 	 s 	 	back	 fore 	 ver 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	 mountain 	 top 	 	removal	 pay 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	little	money	to	the	 local 	 s 	 	,	and	it	 give 	 s 	 	them	a	lot	of	 mis 	 ery 	 	.
The	water	is	 turn 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 go 	 o 	 	.
 Mo 	 st 	 	people	are	still	 un 	 employ 	 ed 	 	,	 lead 	 ing 	 	to	most	of	the	same	 kind 	 s 	 	of	social	 problem 	 s 	 	that	 un 	 employ 	 ed 	 	people	in	inner	cities	 al 	 so 	 	experience	--	drug	and	alcohol	abuse	,	domestic	abuse	,	teen	 pregn 	 ancy 	 	and	poor	heath	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
 N 	 ow 	 	 Ju 	 dy 	 	and	I	--	I	have	to	say	--	 total 	 ly 	 	related	to	each	other	.
Not	 quit 	 e 	 	an	obvious	alliance	.
I	mean	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	her	 home 	 town 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	 White 	 s 	 ville 	 	,	West	 Virgin 	 ia 	 	.
I	mean	,	they	are	not	--	they	ai	n't	 com 	 pet 	 ing 	 	for	the	 birth 	 place 	 	of	hip	hop	title	or	 any 	 thing 	 	like	that	.
But	the	back	of	my	 T 	 - 	 shirt 	 	,	the	one	that	she	 g 	 ave 	 	me	,	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 Sav 	 e 	 	the	 en 	 danger 	 ed 	 	 hill 	 bill 	 ies 	 	.	''
So	 home 	 girl 	 s 	 	and	 hill 	 bill 	 ies 	 	we	got	it	together	and	 total 	 ly 	 	understand	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	's	all	about	.
But	just	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	ago	,	 Ju 	 dy 	 	was	 diagnos 	 ed 	 	with	 stage 	 - 	 three 	 	lung	cancer	.
Yeah	.
And	it	 ha 	 s 	 	since	 move 	 d 	 	to	her	 bone 	 s 	 	and	her	brain	.
And	I	just	find	it	so	bizarre	that	she	's	 suffer 	 ing 	 	from	the	same	thing	that	she	 tri 	 ed 	 	so	hard	to	protect	people	from	.
But	her	dream	of	 Co 	 al 	 	River	 Mount 	 ain 	 	Wind	is	her	 leg 	 acy 	 	.
And	she	might	not	get	to	see	that	 mountain 	 top 	 	.
But	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	writing	yet	some	kind	of	 manifest 	 o 	 	or	 some 	 thing 	 	,	she	's	 leav 	 ing 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	a	business	plan	to	make	it	happen	.
That	's	what	my	 home 	 girl 	 	is	 do 	 ing 	 	.
So	I	'm	so	proud	of	that	.
But	these	three	people	do	n't	know	each	other	,	but	they	do	have	an	awful	lot	in	common	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	all	problem	 solve 	 rs 	 	,	and	they	're	just	some	of	the	 man 	 y 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	that	I	 re 	 ally 	 	am	 privilege 	 d 	 	to	see	,	meet	and	learn	from	in	the	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	the	work	that	I	do	now	.
I	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 luck 	 y 	 	to	have	them	all	 feature 	 d 	 	on	my	 Corp 	 or 	 ation 	 	for	 Pub 	 lic 	 	Radio	radio	show	 call 	 ed 	 	 The 	 Pro 	 mis 	 ed 	 Land 	 .org 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	they	're	all	 ver 	 y 	 	practical	 vision 	 aries 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	take	a	look	at	the	 demand 	 s 	 	that	are	out	there	--	 beaut 	 y 	 	 product 	 s 	 	,	 health 	 y 	 	 school 	 s 	 	,	 electric 	 ity 	 	--	and	how	the	money	's	 flow 	 ing 	 	to	meet	 t 	 hose 	 	 demand 	 s 	 	.
And	when	the	 cheap 	 est 	 	 solution 	 s 	 	involve	 reduc 	 ing 	 	the	number	of	 job 	 s 	 	,	you	're	left	with	 un 	 employ 	 ed 	 	people	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	people	are	n't	cheap	.
In	fact	,	they	make	up	some	of	what	I	call	the	most	expensive	 citizen 	 s 	 	,	and	they	include	 generation 	 ally 	 	 imp 	 over 	 ish 	 ed 	 	,	 trauma 	 t 	 ized 	 	 vet 	 s 	 	 return 	 ing 	 	from	the	Middle	East	,	people	coming	out	of	jail	.
And	for	the	 veteran 	 s 	 	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	the	 V. 	 A 	 	.	 s 	 aid 	 	there	's	a	 six 	 - 	 fold 	 	 in 	 crease 	 	in	mental	health	 pharmaceutical 	 s 	 	by	 vet 	 s 	 	since	2003	.
I	think	that	number	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	going	to	go	up	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	not	the	largest	number	of	people	,	but	they	are	some	of	the	most	expensive	--	and	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	 like 	 li 	 hood 	 	for	domestic	abuse	,	drug	and	alcohol	abuse	,	poor	performance	by	 the 	 ir 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	in	 school 	 s 	 	and	 al 	 so 	 	poor	health	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	of	stress	.
So	these	three	 guy 	 s 	 	all	understand	how	to	 productive 	 ly 	 	channel	 dollar 	 s 	 	through	our	local	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	to	meet	 exist 	 ing 	 	market	 demand 	 s 	 	,	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	social	 problem 	 s 	 	that	we	have	now	and	prevent	new	 problem 	 s 	 	in	the	future	.
And	there	are	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	other	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	like	that	.
One	problem	:	waste	 hand 	 ling 	 	and	 un 	 employ 	 ment 	 	.
Even	when	we	think	or	talk	about	 recycl 	 ing 	 	,	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 recycl 	 able 	 	stuff	 end 	 s 	 	up	 get 	 ting 	 	 inciner 	 ated 	 	or	in	 land 	 fill 	 s 	 	and	 leav 	 ing 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 municipal 	 ities 	 	,	 divers 	 ion 	 	rates	--	they	 leav 	 e 	 	much	to	be	 recycl 	 ed 	 	.
And	where	is	 th 	 is 	 	waste	 handle 	 d 	 	?	 Us 	 ual 	 ly 	 	in	poor	 commun 	 ities 	 	.
And	we	know	that	 eco 	 - 	 industrial 	 	business	,	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	business	 model 	 s 	 	--	there	's	a	model	in	 Euro 	 pe 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 eco 	 - 	 industrial 	 	park	,	where	either	the	waste	of	one	company	is	the	raw	material	for	 an 	 other 	 	,	or	you	use	 recycl 	 ed 	 	 material 	 s 	 	to	make	 good 	 s 	 	that	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	use	and	sell	.
We	can	create	these	local	 market 	 s 	 	and	 incentive 	 s 	 	for	 recycl 	 ed 	 	 material 	 s 	 	to	be	used	 a 	 s 	 	raw	 material 	 s 	 	for	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	.
And	in	my	 home 	 town 	 	,	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	do	one	of	these	in	the	Bronx	,	but	our	mayor	 decide 	 d 	 	what	he	 want 	 ed 	 	to	see	was	a	jail	on	that	same	spot	.
 Fort 	 un 	 ate 	 ly 	 	--	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	create	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 job 	 s 	 	--	but	after	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	,	the	city	 want 	 ed 	 	to	build	a	jail	.
 The 	 y 	 	've	since	 abandon 	 ed 	 	that	project	,	thank	 good 	 ness 	 	.
 An 	 other 	 	problem	:	 un 	 health 	 y 	 	food	 system 	 s 	 	and	 un 	 employ 	 ment 	 	.
 Work 	 ing 	 - 	 class 	 	and	poor	urban	 American 	 s 	 	are	not	 benefit 	 ing 	 	 economic 	 ally 	 	from	our	current	food	system	.
It	 re 	 lies 	 	too	much	on	 transport 	 ation 	 	,	chemical	 fertil 	 ization 	 	,	big	use	of	water	and	 al 	 so 	 	 refrige 	 ration 	 	.
Mega	 agricultur 	 al 	 	 operation 	 s 	 	often	are	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	 poison 	 ing 	 	our	 water 	 ways 	 	and	our	land	,	and	it	 produce 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 un 	 health 	 y 	 	product	that	 cost 	 s 	 	us	 billion 	 s 	 	in	 health 	 care 	 	and	lost	 product 	 ivity 	 	.
And	so	we	know	``	urban	ag	''	is	a	big	buzz	 top 	 ic 	 	 th 	 is 	 	time	of	the	year	,	but	it	's	 most 	 ly 	 	 garden 	 ing 	 	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	some	value	in	community	building	--	 lot 	 s 	 	of	it	--	but	it	's	not	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	creating	 job 	 s 	 	or	for	food	production	.
The	 number 	 s 	 	just	are	n't	there	.
Part	of	my	work	now	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 lay 	 ing 	 	the	 ground 	 work 	 	to	integrate	urban	ag	and	 r 	 ural 	 	food	 system 	 s 	 	to	 ha 	 sten 	 	the	 de 	 mise 	 	of	the	3,000-mile	 s 	 al 	 ad 	 	by	creating	a	national	brand	of	 urban 	 - 	 grown 	 	produce	that	uses	 region 	 al 	 	growing	power	and	 augment 	 s 	 	it	with	 in 	 door 	 	growing	 facil 	 ities 	 	,	owned	and	 oper 	 ated 	 	by	small	 grow 	 ers 	 	,	where	now	there	are	 on 	 ly 	 	 consumer 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	can	support	 season 	 al 	 	 farm 	 ers 	 	around	metro	 area 	 s 	 	who	are	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	out	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 re 	 ally 	 	ca	n't	meet	the	 year 	 - 	 round 	 	demand	for	produce	.
It	's	not	a	 com 	 petition 	 	with	 r 	 ural 	 	farm	;	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 reinforce 	 ments 	 	.
It	 al 	 lies 	 	in	a	 re 	 ally 	 	positive	and	 economic 	 ally 	 	 vi 	 able 	 	food	system	.
The	goal	is	to	meet	the	cities	'	 institution 	 al 	 	 demand 	 s 	 	for	 hospital 	 s 	 	,	senior	 center 	 s 	 	,	 school 	 s 	 	,	 day 	 care 	 	 center 	 s 	 	,	and	produce	a	network	of	 region 	 al 	 	 job 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	smart	 infra 	 structure 	 	.
And	how	we	manage	our	built	environment	 affect 	 s 	 	the	health	and	 well 	 - 	 be 	 ing 	 	of	people	every	single	day	.
Our	 municipal 	 ities 	 	,	 r 	 ural 	 	and	urban	,	play	the	 operation 	 al 	 	course	of	 infra 	 structure 	 	--	 thing 	 s 	 	like	waste	 dispos 	 al 	 	,	energy	demand	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	social	 cost 	 s 	 	of	 un 	 employ 	 ment 	 	,	 drop 	 - 	 out 	 	rates	,	 incarce 	 ration 	 	rates	and	the	 impact 	 s 	 	of	 vari 	 ous 	 	public	health	 cost 	 s 	 	.
Smart	 infra 	 structure 	 	can	provide	 cost 	 - 	 saving 	 	ways	for	 municipal 	 ities 	 	to	handle	both	 infra 	 structure 	 	and	social	 need 	 s 	 	.
And	we	want	to	shift	the	 system 	 s 	 	that	open	the	 door 	 s 	 	for	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	 form 	 er 	 ly 	 	tax	 burden 	 s 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	part	of	the	tax	base	.
And	imagine	a	national	business	model	that	 create 	 s 	 	local	 job 	 s 	 	and	smart	 infra 	 structure 	 	to	improve	local	economic	 st 	 ability 	 	.
So	I	'm	 hop 	 ing 	 	you	can	see	a	little	theme	here	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	 indic 	 ate 	 	a	trend	.
I	have	n't	 create 	 d 	 	it	,	and	it	's	not	 happen 	 ing 	 	by	accident	.
I	'm	 not 	 ic 	 ing 	 	that	it	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	all	over	the	country	,	and	the	good	news	is	that	it	's	growing	.
And	we	all	need	to	be	 invest 	 ed 	 	in	it	.
It	is	an	essential	pillar	to	 th 	 is 	 	country	's	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	.
And	I	call	it	``	 home 	 town 	 	security	.	''
The	 recess 	 ion 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	us	 reel 	 ing 	 	and	 fear 	 ful 	 	,	and	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	in	the	air	these	 day 	 s 	 	that	is	 al 	 so 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 empower 	 ing 	 	.
It	's	a	 real 	 ization 	 	that	we	are	the	key	to	our	own	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	is	the	time	for	us	to	act	in	our	own	 commun 	 ities 	 	where	we	think	local	and	we	act	local	.
And	when	we	do	that	,	our	 neighbor 	 s 	 	--	be	they	 next 	 - 	 door 	 	,	or	in	the	next	state	,	or	in	the	next	country	--	will	be	just	fine	.
The	sum	of	the	local	is	the	global	.
 Home 	 town 	 	security	 mean 	 s 	 	 re 	 building 	 	our	natural	 defense 	 s 	 	,	 put 	 ting 	 	people	to	work	,	 re 	 storing 	 	our	natural	 system 	 s 	 	.
 Home 	 town 	 	security	 mean 	 s 	 	creating	wealth	here	at	home	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 destroy 	 ing 	 	it	 over 	 sea 	 s 	 	.
 Tackl 	 ing 	 	social	and	 environment 	 al 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	at	the	same	time	with	the	same	solution	 yield 	 s 	 	great	cost	 saving 	 s 	 	,	wealth	generation	and	national	security	.
 Man 	 y 	 	great	and	inspiring	 solution 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	generated	 a 	 cross 	 	America	.
The	 challeng 	 e 	 	for	us	now	is	to	identify	and	support	 count 	 less 	 	more	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	 home 	 town 	 	security	is	about	taking	care	of	your	own	,	but	it	's	not	like	the	old	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	 char 	 ity 	 	 begin 	 s 	 	at	home	.	''
I	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	read	a	book	 call 	 ed 	 	``	Love	 Lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	''	by	John	 Hop 	 e 	 	 Bryan 	 t 	 	.
And	it	's	about	 lead 	 ing 	 	in	a	world	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 do 	 es 	 	seem	to	be	 oper 	 ating 	 	on	the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	fear	.
And	 read 	 ing 	 	that	book	made	me	 re 	 examine 	 	that	 theor 	 y 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	I	need	to	explain	what	I	mean	by	that	.
See	,	my	dad	was	a	great	,	great	man	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	.
He	grew	up	in	the	 s 	 egreg 	 ated 	 	South	,	 es 	 cap 	 ed 	 	 ly 	 nch 	 ing 	 	and	all	that	 dur 	 ing 	 	some	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	 time 	 s 	 	,	and	he	 provide 	 d 	 	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 table 	 	home	for	me	and	my	 s 	 i 	 bling 	 s 	 	and	a	whole	bunch	of	other	people	that	fell	on	hard	 time 	 s 	 	.
But	,	like	all	of	us	,	he	had	some	 problem 	 s 	 	.
And	his	was	 gam 	 bling 	 	,	 compulsive 	 ly 	 	.
To	him	that	phrase	,	``	 Char 	 ity 	 	 begin 	 s 	 	at	home	,	''	 me 	 ant 	 	that	my	 pay 	 day 	 	--	or	 some 	 one 	 	else	's	--	would	just	happen	to	coincide	with	his	 luck 	 y 	 	day	.
So	you	need	to	help	him	out	.
And	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	I	would	loan	him	money	from	my	 after 	 - 	 school 	 	or	summer	 job 	 s 	 	,	and	he	 al 	 ways 	 	had	the	great	 intent 	 ion 	 	of	 pay 	 ing 	 	me	back	with	interest	,	of	course	,	after	he	hit	it	big	.
And	he	did	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	 believ 	 e 	 	it	or	not	,	at	a	 race 	 track 	 	in	 Lo 	 s 	 	 Angel 	 es 	 	--	one	reason	to	love	 L. 	 A. 	 	--	back	in	the	1940s	.
He	made	15,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	cash	and	 b 	 ought 	 	the	house	that	I	grew	up	in	.
So	I	'm	not	that	 un 	 happy 	 	about	that	.
But	listen	,	I	did	feel	 oblig 	 ated 	 	to	him	,	and	I	grew	up	--	then	I	grew	up	.
And	I	'm	a	grown	woman	now	,	and	I	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	a	few	 thing 	 s 	 	 a 	 long 	 	the	way	.
To	me	,	 char 	 ity 	 	often	is	just	about	giving	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	're	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	,	or	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	what	you	've	 al 	 ways 	 	 d 	 one 	 	,	or	it	's	about	giving	 un 	 til 	 	it	 hurt 	 s 	 	.
I	'm	about	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	the	 mean 	 s 	 	to	build	 some 	 thing 	 	that	will	grow	and	 intens 	 ify 	 	 it 	 s 	 	original	 invest 	 ment 	 	and	not	just	 requir 	 e 	 	 great 	 er 	 	giving	next	year	--	I	'm	not	 try 	 ing 	 	to	feed	the	habit	.
I	 s 	 pent 	 	some	 year 	 s 	 	 watch 	 ing 	 	how	good	 intent 	 ions 	 	for	community	 empower 	 ment 	 	,	that	 we 	 re 	 	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	there	to	support	the	community	and	empower	it	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	left	people	in	the	same	,	if	not	 wo 	 rse 	 	,	position	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	in	before	.
And	over	the	past	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	've	 s 	 pent 	 	record	 amount 	 s 	 	of	 philanthro 	 pic 	 	 dollar 	 s 	 	on	social	 problem 	 s 	 	,	yet	 education 	 al 	 	 out 	 come 	 s 	 	,	 mal 	 nutrition 	 	,	 incarce 	 ration 	 	,	 obes 	 ity 	 	,	diabetes	,	income	 dis 	 par 	 ity 	 	,	they	've	all	gone	up	with	some	 exception 	 s 	 	--	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	infant	 mortal 	 ity 	 	among	people	in	poverty	--	but	it	's	a	great	world	that	we	're	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	them	 in 	 to 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
And	I	know	a	little	bit	about	these	 issue 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	for	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	,	I	 s 	 pent 	 	a	long	time	in	the	 non 	 - 	 profit 	 	industrial	complex	,	and	I	'm	a	 re 	 cover 	 ing 	 	 ex 	 ecutive 	 	director	,	two	 year 	 s 	 	clean	.
But	 dur 	 ing 	 	that	time	,	I	 real 	 ized 	 	that	it	was	about	 project 	 s 	 	and	 develop 	 ing 	 	them	on	the	local	level	that	 re 	 ally 	 	was	going	to	do	the	right	thing	for	our	 commun 	 ities 	 	.
But	I	 re 	 ally 	 	did	struggle	for	financial	support	.
The	 great 	 er 	 	our	success	,	the	less	money	came	in	from	 found 	 ations 	 	.
And	I	tell	you	,	 be 	 ing 	 	on	the	TED	stage	and	winning	a	 Mac 	 Arthur 	 	in	the	same	exact	year	 g 	 ave 	 	 every 	 one 	 	the	impression	that	I	had	 arriv 	 ed 	 	.
And	by	the	time	I	'd	 move 	 d 	 	on	,	I	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 cover 	 ing 	 	a	third	of	my	 age 	 ncy 	 	's	budget	 defici 	 t 	 	with	 s 	 peaking 	 	 fee 	 s 	 	.
And	I	think	 be 	 cause 	 	early	on	,	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	my	 program 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	just	a	little	bit	 a 	 head 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	time	.
But	since	then	,	the	park	that	was	just	a	dump	and	was	 feature 	 d 	 	at	a	 TED 	 200 	 6 	 	Talk	 be 	 came 	 	 th 	 is 	 	little	thing	.
But	I	did	in	fact	get	married	in	it	.
Over	here	.
There	 go 	 es 	 	my	dog	who	led	me	to	the	park	in	my	 wed 	 d 	 ing 	 	.
The	South	Bronx	 Green 	 way 	 	was	 al 	 so 	 	just	a	 draw 	 ing 	 	on	the	stage	back	in	2006	.
Since	then	,	we	got	about	50	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	in	 stimul 	 us 	 	package	money	to	come	and	get	here	.
And	we	love	 th 	 is 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	I	love	construction	now	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	 watch 	 ing 	 	these	 thing 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	happen	.
So	I	want	 every 	 one 	 	to	understand	the	critical	 import 	 ance 	 	of	shifting	 char 	 ity 	 	 in 	 to 	 	enterprise	.
I	 start 	 ed 	 	my	firm	to	help	 commun 	 ities 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	country	 real 	 ize 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	potential	to	improve	 every 	 thing 	 	about	the	quality	of	life	for	 the 	 ir 	 	people	.
 Home 	 town 	 	security	is	next	on	my	 to 	 - 	 do 	 	list	.
What	we	need	are	people	who	see	the	value	in	 invest 	 ing 	 	in	these	 type 	 s 	 	of	local	 enterprise 	 s 	 	,	who	will	partner	with	 folk 	 s 	 	like	me	to	identify	the	growth	 trend 	 s 	 	and	climate	 adapt 	 ation 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	understand	the	growing	social	 cost 	 s 	 	of	business	 a 	 s 	 	usual	.
We	need	to	work	together	to	embrace	and	repair	our	land	,	repair	our	power	 system 	 s 	 	and	repair	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
It	's	time	to	stop	building	the	 shop 	 ping 	 	 mall 	 s 	 	,	the	 pri 	 son 	 s 	 	,	the	 stad 	 ium 	 s 	 	and	other	 tribute 	 s 	 	to	all	of	our	 collect 	 ive 	 	 failure 	 s 	 	.

Thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
 Mo 	 st 	 	people	do	n't	know	that	when	I	went	to	high	school	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	--	I	 appli 	 ed 	 	for	university	at	a	time	when	I	was	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	I	was	going	to	be	an	artist	and	be	a	 sculpt 	 or 	 	.
And	I	came	from	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 privilege 	 d 	 	 back 	 ground 	 	.	I	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 luck 	 y 	 	.
My	family	was	 wealth 	 y 	 	,	and	my	father	 believ 	 ed 	 	in	one	thing	,	and	that	was	to	give	us	all	 a 	 s 	 	much	education	 a 	 s 	 	we	 want 	 ed 	 	.
And	I	 announce 	 d 	 	I	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	a	 sculpt 	 or 	 	in	Paris	.
And	he	was	a	clever	man	.	He	sort	of	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Well	,	that	's	 O 	 K 	 	,	but	you	've	 d 	 one 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	well	in	your	math	SATs	.	''
In	fact	,	I	'd	got	an	800	.	And	he	thought	I	did	 ver 	 y 	 	well	--	and	I	did	,	too	--	in	the	 art 	 s 	 	:	 th 	 is 	 	was	my	 pass 	 ion 	 	.
And	he	 s 	 aid 	 	``	If	you	go	to	 MI 	 T 	 	,	''	to	which	I	had	 be 	 en 	 	 give 	 n 	 	early	 ad 	 mission 	 	,	``	I	will	pay	for	every	year	you	're	at	 MI 	 T 	 	,	in	graduate	or	 under 	 graduate 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	you	want	--	I	will	pay	for	an	equal	number	of	 year 	 s 	 	for	you	to	live	in	Paris	.	''
And	I	thought	that	was	the	best	deal	in	town	,	so	I	 accept 	 ed 	 	it	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	.
And	I	 decide 	 d 	 	that	if	I	was	good	in	art	,	and	I	was	good	in	 mathematic 	 s 	 	,	I	'd	 stud 	 y 	 	 architect 	 ure 	 	,	which	was	the	 blend 	 ing 	 	of	the	two	.
I	went	and	told	my	 head 	 master 	 	that	,	at	prep	school	.
And	I	 s 	 aid 	 	to	him	what	I	was	 do 	 ing 	 	,	that	I	was	going	to	go	 stud 	 y 	 	 architect 	 ure 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	art	and	 mathematic 	 s 	 	put	together	.
He	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	 some 	 thing 	 	that	just	went	 complete 	 ly 	 	over	my	head	.
He	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	You	know	,	I	like	 gr 	 ey 	 	 suit 	 s 	 	,	and	I	like	pin-striped	 suit 	 s 	 	,	but	I	do	n't	like	 gr 	 ey 	 	pin-striped	 suit 	 s 	 	.	''
And	I	thought	,	``	What	a	 tur 	 key 	 	 th 	 is 	 	guy	is	,	''	and	I	went	off	to	 MI 	 T 	 	.
I	 stud 	 ied 	 	 architect 	 ure 	 	,	then	did	a	second	degree	in	 architect 	 ure 	 	,	and	then	 actual 	 ly 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	 real 	 ized 	 	that	it	was	n't	 architect 	 ure 	 	.
That	 re 	 ally 	 	,	the	 mix 	 ing 	 	of	art	and	science	was	 computer 	 s 	 	,	and	that	that	 re 	 ally 	 	was	the	place	to	 br 	 ing 	 	both	,	and	 enjoy 	 ed 	 	a	 care 	 er 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	that	.
And	 prob 	 ably 	 	,	if	I	 we 	 re 	 	to	fill	out	Jim	Citrin	's	scale	,	I	'd	put	100	percent	on	the	side	of	the	 equ 	 ation 	 	where	you	 s 	 pend 	 	time	making	it	possible	for	 other 	 s 	 	to	be	creative	.
And	after	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	for	a	long	time	,	and	the	 Med 	 ia 	 	Lab	 pass 	 ing 	 	the	 ba 	 ton 	 	on	,	I	thought	,	``	Well	,	 may 	 be 	 	it	's	time	for	me	to	do	a	project	.
 Some 	 thing 	 	that	would	be	 import 	 ant 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	would	take	advantage	of	all	of	these	privileges	that	one	had	.	''
And	in	the	case	of	the	 Med 	 ia 	 	Lab	,	 know 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	people	,	 know 	 ing 	 	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	either	 ex 	 ecutive 	 s 	 	or	 wealth 	 y 	 	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	not	 hav 	 ing 	 	,	in	my	own	case	,	a	 care 	 er 	 	to	worry	about	 any 	 more 	 	.
My	 care 	 er 	 	,	I	mean	,	I	'd	 d 	 one 	 	my	 care 	 er 	 	.
Did	n't	have	to	worry	about	 earn 	 ing 	 	money	.
Did	n't	have	to	worry	about	what	people	thought	about	me	.
And	I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Boy	,	let	's	 re 	 ally 	 	do	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 take 	 s 	 	advantage	of	all	these	 feature 	 s 	 	,	''	and	thought	that	if	we	could	address	education	,	by	 lever 	 aging 	 	the	children	,	and	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	to	the	world	the	access	of	the	 computer 	 s 	 	,	that	that	was	 re 	 ally 	 	the	thing	we	should	do	.
Never	 show 	 n 	 	 th 	 is 	 	picture	before	,	and	 prob 	 ably 	 	going	to	be	 su 	 ed 	 	for	it	.
It	's	taken	at	three	 o 	 ' 	 clock 	 	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	the	 per 	 mission 	 	of	the	company	.
It	's	about	two	 week 	 s 	 	old	.	There	they	are	,	 folk 	 s 	 	.
If	you	look	at	the	picture	,	you	'll	see	they	're	 stack 	 ed 	 	up	.
 T 	 hose 	 	are	 convey 	 or 	 	 belt 	 s 	 	that	go	around	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	 convey 	 or 	 	 belt 	 s 	 	with	the	thing	going	by	,	but	then	you	'll	see	the	 one 	 s 	 	up	above	.
What	 happen 	 s 	 	is	,	they	burn	 in 	 to 	 	flash	 memor 	 y 	 	the	 soft 	 ware 	 	,	and	then	test	them	for	a	few	 hour 	 s 	 	.
But	you	've	got	to	have	the	thing	moving	on	the	 assem 	 bly 	 	line	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	constant	.
So	they	go	around	in	 th 	 is 	 	loop	,	which	is	why	you	see	them	up	there	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	was	great	for	us	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	a	real	 turn 	 ing 	 	point	.	But	it	 go 	 es 	 	back	.
 Th 	 is 	 	picture	was	taken	in	1982	,	just	before	the	IBM	PC	was	even	 announce 	 d 	 	.
Seymour	 Pa 	 pert 	 	and	I	 we 	 re 	 	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	to	 school 	 s 	 	and	 develop 	 ing 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	at	a	time	when	it	was	way	 a 	 head 	 	of	 it 	 self 	 	.
But	one	thing	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	was	that	these	 kid 	 s 	 	can	 absolute 	 ly 	 	jump	 in 	 to 	 	it	just	the	same	way	 a 	 s 	 	our	 kid 	 s 	 	do	here	.
And	when	people	tell	me	,	``	Who	's	going	to	teach	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	to	teach	the	 kid 	 s 	 	?	''
I	say	to	 my 	 self 	 	,	``	What	planet	do	you	come	from	?	''
 Oka 	 y 	 	,	there	's	not	a	person	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	--	I	do	n't	care	how	 tech 	 ie 	 	you	are	--	there	's	not	a	person	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	give	 the 	 ir 	 	 lap 	 top 	 	or	cell	phone	to	a	kid	to	help	them	debug	it	.	 O 	 K 	 	?
We	all	need	help	,	even	 t 	 hose 	 	of	us	who	are	 ver 	 y 	 	seasoned	.
 Th 	 is 	 	picture	of	Seymour	--	25	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.	Seymour	made	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 observ 	 ation 	 	in	1968	,	and	then	 bas 	 ically 	 	 present 	 ed 	 	it	in	1970	--	April	11	to	be	precise	--	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 Teach 	 ing 	 	 Child 	 ren 	 	 Think 	 ing 	 	.	''
What	he	 observ 	 ed 	 	was	that	 kid 	 s 	 	who	write	computer	 program 	 s 	 	understand	 thing 	 s 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	,	and	when	they	debug	the	 program 	 s 	 	,	they	come	the	 close 	 st 	 	to	 learn 	 ing 	 	about	 learn 	 ing 	 	.
That	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	and	in	some	sense	,	we	've	lost	that	.
 Kid 	 s 	 	do	n't	program	 en 	 ough 	 	and	boy	,	if	there	's	 any 	 thing 	 	I	hope	 th 	 is 	 	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	back	,	it	's	 programm 	 ing 	 	to	 kid 	 s 	 	.
It	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.	 Us 	 ing 	 	 application 	 s 	 	is	 O 	 K 	 	,	but	 programm 	 ing 	 	is	 absolute 	 ly 	 	fundamental	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 launch 	 ed 	 	with	three	 language 	 s 	 	in	it	:	Squeak	,	 Lo 	 go 	 	,	and	a	third	,	that	I	've	never	even	 s 	 een 	 	before	.
The	point	 be 	 ing 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	intensive	on	the	 programm 	 ing 	 	side	.
 Th 	 is 	 	photograph	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	much	 lat 	 er 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	in	the	early	2000s	.	My	son	,	 Dimi 	 tri 	 	--	who	's	here	,	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	know	 Dimi 	 tri 	 	--	went	to	Cambodia	,	set	up	 th 	 is 	 	school	that	we	had	built	,	just	 a 	 s 	 	the	school	 connect 	 ed 	 	it	to	the	Internet	.
And	these	 kid 	 s 	 	had	 the 	 ir 	 	 lap 	 top 	 s 	 	.	But	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	what	 spirit 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	plus	the	influence	of	 Jo 	 e 	 	and	 other 	 s 	 	.	We	 start 	 ed 	 	One	 Lap 	 top 	 	per	Child	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	same	village	in	Cambodia	,	just	a	couple	of	 month 	 s 	 	ago	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	are	real	 pro 	 s 	 	.	There	 we 	 re 	 	just	7,000	 machine 	 s 	 	out	there	 be 	 ing 	 	tested	by	 kid 	 s 	 	.	 Be 	 ing 	 	a	 non 	 profit 	 	is	 absolute 	 ly 	 	fundamental	.
 Every 	 body 	 	 advise 	 d 	 	me	not	to	be	a	 non 	 profit 	 	,	but	they	 we 	 re 	 	all	wrong	.
And	the	reason	 be 	 ing 	 	a	 non 	 profit 	 	is	 import 	 ant 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	twofold	.
There	are	 man 	 y 	 	 reason 	 s 	 	,	but	the	two	that	merit	the	little	bit	of	time	is	:	one	,	the	 clar 	 ity 	 	of	purpose	is	there	.	The	moral	purpose	is	clear	.
I	can	see	any	head	of	state	,	any	 ex 	 ecutive 	 	I	want	,	at	any	time	,	 be 	 cause 	 	I	'm	not	selling	 lap 	 top 	 s 	 	.	 O 	 K 	 	?	I	have	no	 share 	 holder 	 s 	 	.
 W 	 he 	 ther 	 	we	sell	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	any	 differ 	 ence 	 	 what 	 so 	 ever 	 	.
The	 clar 	 ity 	 	of	purpose	is	 absolute 	 ly 	 	critical	.	And	the	second	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 counter 	 intuitive 	 	--	you	can	get	the	best	people	in	the	world	.
If	you	look	at	our	professional	 service 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	search	 firm 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 communication 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	legal	 service 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 bank 	 ing 	 	,	they	're	all	pro	bono	.	And	it	's	not	to	 s 	 ave 	 	money	.
We	've	got	money	in	the	bank	.	It	's	 be 	 cause 	 	you	get	the	best	people	.
You	get	the	people	who	are	 do 	 ing 	 	it	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 believ 	 e 	 	in	the	mission	,	and	they	're	the	best	people	.
We	could	n't	afford	to	hire	a	 C 	 FO 	 	.	We	put	out	a	job	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	for	a	 C 	 FO 	 	at	zero	 s 	 al 	 ary 	 	,	and	we	had	a	queue	of	people	.
It	 allow 	 s 	 	you	to	team	up	with	people	.	The	 U. 	 N. 	 	's	not	going	to	be	our	partner	if	we	're	profit	making	.	So	 announc 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	with	 K 	 ofi 	 	 Ann 	 an 	 	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	and	the	 U. 	 N. 	 	 allow 	 ed 	 	us	to	 bas 	 ically 	 	reach	all	the	 count 	 ries 	 	.	And	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	machine	we	 we 	 re 	 	 show 	 ing 	 	before	I	met	 Y 	 ves 	 	 Be 	 har 	 	.
And	while	 th 	 is 	 	machine	in	some	sense	is	 s 	 il 	 ly 	 	,	in	retrospect	,	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 serv 	 ed 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	purpose	.
That	pencil-yellow	crank	was	 remember 	 ed 	 	by	 every 	 body 	 	.
 Every 	 body 	 	 remember 	 ed 	 	the	pencil-yellow	crank	.	It	's	different	.
It	was	 get 	 ting 	 	 it 	 s 	 	power	in	a	different	way	.	It	's	kind	of	 child 	 like 	 	.
Even	 th 	 ough 	 	 th 	 is 	 	was	n't	the	direction	we	went	 be 	 cause 	 	the	crank	--	it	 re 	 ally 	 	is	stupid	to	have	it	on	board	,	by	the	way	.
In	spite	of	what	some	people	in	the	press	do	n't	get	it	,	did	n't	understand	it	,	we	did	n't	take	it	off	 be 	 cause 	 	we	did	n't	want	to	do	--	 hav 	 ing 	 	it	on	the	 lap 	 top 	 	 it 	 self 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	not	what	you	want	.
You	want	a	 separat 	 e 	 	thing	,	like	the	AC	adaptor	.
I	did	n't	 br 	 ing 	 	one	with	me	,	but	they	 re 	 ally 	 	work	much	better	off-board	.
And	then	,	I	could	tell	you	 lot 	 s 	 	about	the	 lap 	 top 	 	,	but	I	 decide 	 d 	 	on	just	four	 thing 	 s 	 	.
Just	keep	in	mind	--	 be 	 cause 	 	there	are	other	people	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	Bill	 Gate 	 s 	 	,	who	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Gee	,	you	've	got	a	real	computer	.	''
That	computer	is	 un 	 like 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	you	've	had	,	and	 do 	 es 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	--	there	are	four	of	them	--	that	you	do	n't	come	close	to	.	And	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	be	low	power	,	and	I	hope	that	's	 pick 	 ed 	 	up	more	by	the	industry	.
That	the	reason	that	you	want	to	be	 be 	 low 	 	two	 watt 	 s 	 	is	that	's	 rough 	 ly 	 	what	you	can	generate	with	your	upper	body	.
Dual-mode	 dis 	 play 	 	--	that	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	 dis 	 play 	 	's	fantastic	.
We	 we 	 re 	 	using	it	at	lunch	 to 	 day 	 	in	the	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	,	and	the	more	 s 	 un 	 light 	 	the	better	.
And	that	was	 re 	 ally 	 	critical	.	The	mesh	network	,	it	'll	 be 	 come 	 	 common 	 place 	 	.
And	of	course	,	``	 rug 	 ged 	 	''	 go 	 es 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	.
And	the	reason	I	think	design	 matter 	 s 	 	is	n't	 be 	 cause 	 	I	 want 	 ed 	 	to	go	to	art	school	.
And	by	the	way	,	when	I	 graduate 	 d 	 	from	 MI 	 T 	 	,	I	thought	the	worst	and	silliest	thing	to	do	would	be	to	go	to	Paris	for	six	 year 	 s 	 	.
So	,	I	did	n't	do	that	.	But	design	 matter 	 s 	 	for	a	number	of	 reason 	 s 	 	.
The	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	that	it	is	the	best	way	to	make	an	 in 	 expensive 	 	product	.
 Mo 	 st 	 	people	make	 in 	 expensive 	 	 product 	 s 	 	by	taking	cheap	design	,	cheap	labor	,	cheap	 component 	 s 	 	,	and	making	a	cheap	 lap 	 top 	 	.
And	,	in	English	,	the	word	``	cheap	''	 ha 	 s 	 	a	double	meaning	,	which	is	 re 	 ally 	 	appropriate	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	cheap	,	in	the	 pe 	 jo 	 rative 	 	sense	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	 in 	 expensive 	 	.
But	if	you	take	a	different	approach	,	and	you	think	of	 ver 	 y 	 	 large 	 - 	 scale 	 	 integ 	 ration 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 advance 	 d 	 	 material 	 s 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 advance 	 d 	 	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	--	so	you	're	 pour 	 ing 	 	 chemical 	 s 	 	in	one	end	,	 iPod 	 s 	 	are	 spew 	 ing 	 	out	the	other	--	and	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	design	,	that	's	what	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	.
And	I	can	race	through	these	and	 s 	 ave 	 	a	lot	of	time	 be 	 cause 	 	 Y 	 ves 	 	and	I	 obvious 	 ly 	 	did	n't	 compar 	 e 	 	 note 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	his	 slide 	 s 	 	,	and	so	I	do	n't	have	to	talk	about	them	.
But	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	,	to	us	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	.
It	was	n't	just	to	kind	of	make	it	cute	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 some 	 body 	 	--	you	know	,	good	design	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
 Y 	 ves 	 	 show 	 ed 	 	one	of	the	 power 	 - 	 generating 	 	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	.
The	mesh	network	,	the	reason	I	--	and	I	wo	n't	go	 in 	 to 	 	it	in	great	detail	--	but	when	we	deliver	 lap 	 top 	 s 	 	to	 kid 	 s 	 	in	the	 remote 	 st 	 	and	 poor 	 est 	 	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	world	,	they	're	 connect 	 ed 	 	.	There	's	not	just	 lap 	 top 	 s 	 	.
And	so	,	we	have	to	drop	in	satellite	 dish 	 es 	 	.	We	put	in	 gene 	 rator 	 s 	 	.
It	's	a	lot	of	stuff	that	 go 	 es 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	these	.	 Th 	 ese 	 	can	talk	to	each	other	.
If	you	're	in	a	desert	,	they	can	talk	to	each	other	about	two	 kilometer 	 s 	 	 a 	 part 	 	.
If	you	're	in	the	jungle	,	it	's	about	500	 meter 	 s 	 	.	So	if	a	kid	 bi 	 cycle 	 s 	 	home	,	or	 walk 	 s 	 	a	few	 mile 	 s 	 	,	they	're	going	to	be	off	the	grid	,	so	to	speak	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	not	going	to	be	near	 an 	 other 	 	 lap 	 top 	 	,	so	you	have	to	nail	these	onto	a	tree	,	and	sort	of	,	get	it	.
You	do	n't	call	 Ver 	 i 	 zon 	 	or	Sprint	.	You	build	your	own	network	.
And	that	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	the	user	 inter 	 face 	 	.
We	are	 launch 	 ing 	 	with	18	 key 	 board 	 s 	 	.	English	is	by	far	the	 minor 	 ity 	 	.
 Lat 	 in 	 	is	 relat 	 ively 	 	rare	,	too	.	You	just	look	at	some	of	the	 language 	 s 	 	.
I	'm	 will 	 ing 	 	to	suspect	some	of	you	had	n't	even	heard	of	them	before	.
 I 	 s 	 	there	 any 	 body 	 	in	the	room	,	one	person	,	 un 	 less 	 	you	work	with	 OL 	 PC 	 	,	is	there	 any 	 body 	 	in	the	room	that	can	tell	me	what	language	the	 key 	 board 	 	is	that	's	on	the	screen	?	There	's	 on 	 ly 	 	one	hand	--	so	you	get	it	.
Yes	,	you	're	right	.	He	's	right	.	It	's	Amharic	,	it	's	 Ethiopia 	 n 	 	.	In	Ethiopia	,	there	's	never	 be 	 en 	 	a	 key 	 board 	 	.
There	is	no	 key 	 board 	 	standard	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	no	market	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	big	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
 Aga 	 in 	 	,	when	you	're	a	 non 	 profit 	 	,	you	look	at	children	 a 	 s 	 	a	mission	,	not	 a 	 s 	 	a	market	.
So	we	went	to	Ethiopia	,	and	we	 help 	 ed 	 	them	make	a	 key 	 board 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	will	 be 	 come 	 	the	standard	 Ethiopia 	 n 	 	 key 	 board 	 	.
So	what	I	want	to	end	with	is	sort	of	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	to	roll	it	out	.
And	we	 change 	 d 	 	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	.	I	 decide 	 d 	 	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	--	it	was	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	thing	to	decide	in	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	it	's	not	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	now	--	is	to	go	to	six	 count 	 ries 	 	.
Big	 count 	 ries 	 	,	one	of	them	is	not	so	big	,	but	it	's	rich	.
 He 	 re 	 	's	the	six	.	We	went	to	the	six	,	and	in	each	case	the	head	of	state	 s 	 aid 	 	he	would	do	it	,	he	'd	do	a	million	.
In	the	case	of	Qaddafi	,	he	'd	do	1.2	million	,	and	that	they	would	launch	it	.
We	thought	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	right	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	,	get	it	out	,	and	then	the	little	 count 	 ries 	 	could	sort	of	 piggy 	 back 	 	on	these	big	 count 	 ries 	 	.
And	so	I	went	to	each	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	at	 l 	 east 	 	six	 time 	 s 	 	,	met	with	the	head	of	state	 prob 	 ably 	 	two	or	three	 time 	 s 	 	.
In	each	case	,	got	the	 mini 	 sters 	 	,	went	through	a	lot	of	the	stuff	.
 Th 	 is 	 	was	a	period	in	my	life	where	I	was	 travel 	 ing 	 	330	 day 	 s 	 	per	year	.
Not	 some 	 thing 	 	you	'd	 en 	 vy 	 	or	want	to	do	.
In	the	case	of	Libya	,	it	was	a	lot	of	 f 	 un 	 	 meet 	 ing 	 	Qaddafi	in	his	tent	.
The	camel	 smell 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 un 	 believ 	 able 	 	.
And	it	was	45	 degree 	 s 	 	C.	I	mean	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	not	what	you	'd	call	a	cool	experience	.	And	 form 	 er 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	--	I	say	 form 	 er 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 non 	 e 	 	of	them	 re 	 ally 	 	came	through	 th 	 is 	 	summer	--	there	was	a	big	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	 get 	 ting 	 	a	head	of	state	to	have	a	photo	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	,	make	a	press	 re 	 lease 	 	.
So	we	went	to	 small 	 er 	 	 one 	 s 	 	.	 Ur 	 ug 	 uay 	 	,	bless	 the 	 ir 	 	 heart 	 s 	 	.
Small	country	,	not	so	rich	.	 P 	 resident 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	he	'd	do	it	,	and	guess	what	?
He	did	do	it	.	The	tender	had	 noth 	 ing 	 	in	it	that	related	to	us	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	specific	about	sunlight-readable	,	 mesh 	 - 	 network 	 	,	low-power	,	but	just	a	 van 	 illa 	 	 lap 	 top 	 	proposal	.
And	guess	what	?	We	won	it	 hand 	 s 	 	down	.
When	it	was	 announce 	 d 	 	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	do	every	child	in	 Ur 	 ug 	 uay 	 	,	the	first	100,000	,	boom	,	went	to	 OL 	 PC 	 	.
The	next	day	--	the	next	day	,	not	even	24	 hour 	 s 	 	had	 pass 	 ed 	 	--	in	 Per 	 u 	 	,	the	 p 	 resident 	 	of	 Per 	 u 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	We	'll	do	250	.	''	And	boom	,	a	little	 domin 	 o 	 	effect	.
The	 p 	 resident 	 	of	Rwanda	 steppe 	 d 	 	in	and	 s 	 aid 	 	he	would	do	it	.
The	 p 	 resident 	 	of	Ethiopia	 s 	 aid 	 	he	would	do	it	.
And	boom	,	boom	,	boom	.	The	 p 	 resident 	 	of	 Mon 	 golia 	 	.
And	so	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	,	these	 thing 	 s 	 	start	to	happen	with	these	 count 	 ries 	 	--	still	not	 en 	 ough 	 	.
Add	up	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	,	it	did	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	get	to	thing	,	so	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Let	's	start	a	program	in	the	 Unit 	 ed 	 	 Stat 	 es 	 	.	''	So	,	end	of	 Au 	 gust 	 	,	early	September	,	we	decide	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.	We	 announce 	 d 	 	it	near	the	middle	,	end	--	just	when	the	Clinton	 In 	 iti 	 ative 	 	was	taking	place	.
We	thought	that	was	a	good	time	to	announce	it	.
Launched	it	on	the	12	of	 Nove 	 mb 	 er 	 	.
We	 s 	 aid 	 	it	would	be	just	for	a	short	period	 un 	 til 	 	the	26	.	We	've	 extend 	 ed 	 	it	 un 	 til 	 	the	31	.
And	the	``	 G 	 ive 	 	One	,	Get	One	''	program	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	got	a	lot	of	people	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	.
The	first	day	it	was	just	wild	.	And	then	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Well	,	let	's	get	people	to	give	 man 	 y 	 	.	Not	just	one	,	and	get	one	,	but	 may 	 be 	 	give	100	,	give	1,000	.	''	And	that	's	where	you	come	in	.
And	that	's	where	I	think	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.	I	do	n't	want	you	all	to	go	out	and	buy	400	 dollar 	 s 	 	worth	of	 lap 	 top 	 s 	 	.	 Oka 	 y 	 	?	Do	it	,	but	that	's	not	going	to	help	.	 Oka 	 y 	 	?
If	 every 	 body 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	 go 	 es 	 	out	 to 	 night 	 	and	 order 	 s 	 	one	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	for	400	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	,	300	people	in	the	room	 do 	 ing 	 	it	--	 yea 	 h 	 	,	great	.
I	want	you	do	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
And	it	's	not	to	go	out	and	buy	100	or	1,000	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	I	 invit 	 e 	 	you	to	do	that	,	and	10,000	would	be	even	better	.
Tell	people	about	it	!	It	's	got	to	 be 	 come 	 	viral	,	 O 	 K 	 	?
Use	your	 mail 	 ing 	 	 list 	 s 	 	.	People	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	have	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 mail 	 ing 	 	 list 	 s 	 	.
Get	your	 friend 	 s 	 	to	give	one	,	get	one	.
And	if	each	one	of	you	 s 	 end 	 s 	 	it	to	300	or	400	people	,	that	would	be	fantastic	.
I	wo	n't	 d 	 well 	 	on	the	 pric 	 ing 	 	at	all	.
Just	to	say	that	when	you	do	the	``	 G 	 ive 	 	One	,	Get	One	,	''	a	lot	of	press	is	a	bit	about	,	``	 The 	 y 	 	did	n't	make	it	,	it	's	188	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	it	's	not	100	.	''
It	will	be	100	in	two	 year 	 s 	 	.	It	will	go	 be 	 low 	 	100	.
We	've	 pledg 	 ed 	 	not	to	add	 feature 	 s 	 	,	but	to	 br 	 ing 	 	that	price	down	.
But	it	was	the	 count 	 ries 	 	that	 want 	 ed 	 	it	to	go	up	,	and	we	let	them	push	it	up	for	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 reason 	 s 	 	.	So	what	you	can	do	--	I	've	just	 s 	 aid 	 	it	.	Do	n't	just	give	one	,	get	one	.
I	just	want	to	end	with	one	last	one	.	 Th 	 is 	 	one	is	not	even	24-hours	old	,	or	 may 	 be 	 	it	's	24-hours	.
The	first	 kid 	 s 	 	got	 the 	 ir 	 	 lap 	 top 	 s 	 	.	 The 	 y 	 	got	them	by	ship	,	and	I	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	now	about	7,000	,	8,000	at	a	time	went	out	 th 	 is 	 	week	.
 The 	 y 	 	went	to	 Ur 	 ug 	 uay 	 	,	 Per 	 u 	 	,	Mexico	.
And	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 low 	 	coming	,	and	we	're	 on 	 ly 	 	making	about	5,000	a	week	,	but	we	hope	,	we	hope	,	 some 	 time 	 	in	next	year	,	 may 	 be 	 	by	the	middle	of	the	year	,	to	hit	a	million	a	month	.	 N 	 ow 	 	put	that	number	,	and	a	million	is	n't	so	much	.	It	's	not	a	big	number	.
We	're	selling	a	billion	cell	 phone 	 s 	 	 world 	 wide 	 	 th 	 is 	 	year	.
But	a	million	a	month	in	laptop-land	is	a	big	number	.
And	the	world	production	 to 	 day 	 	,	 every 	 body 	 	 combine 	 d 	 	,	making	 lap 	 top 	 s 	 	,	is	five	million	a	month	.	So	I	'm	 stand 	 ing 	 	here	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	that	 some 	 time 	 	next	year	,	we	're	going	to	make	20	percent	of	the	world	production	.
And	if	we	do	that	,	there	are	going	to	be	a	lot	of	 luck 	 y 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	out	there	.
And	we	hope	if	you	have	EG	two	 year 	 s 	 	from	now	,	or	 when 	 ever 	 	you	have	it	 aga 	 in 	 	,	I	wo	n't	have	bad	breath	,	and	I	will	be	 invit 	 ed 	 	back	,	and	will	have	,	 hope 	 fully 	 	by	then	,	 may 	 be 	 	100	million	out	there	to	children	.
Thank	you	.
I	,	like	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	,	am	one	of	the	two	billion	people	on	Earth	who	live	in	cities	.
And	there	are	 day 	 s 	 	--	I	do	n't	know	about	the	rest	of	you	 guy 	 s 	 	--	but	there	are	 day 	 s 	 	when	I	 palp 	 ably 	 	feel	how	much	I	 re 	 ly 	 	on	other	people	for	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 every 	 thing 	 	in	my	life	.
And	some	 day 	 s 	 	,	that	can	even	be	a	little	 scar 	 y 	 	.
But	what	I	'm	here	to	talk	to	you	about	 to 	 day 	 	is	how	that	same	 inter 	 depend 	 ence 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	an	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	social	 infra 	 structure 	 	that	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	harness	to	help	heal	some	of	our	 deep 	 est 	 	civic	 issue 	 s 	 	,	if	we	 app 	 ly 	 	open	source	 collabor 	 ation 	 	.
A	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	I	read	an	article	by	New	York	 Time 	 s 	 	writer	Michael	 Poll 	 an 	 	in	which	he	 argu 	 ed 	 	that	growing	even	some	of	our	own	food	is	one	of	the	best	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	can	do	for	the	environment	.
 N 	 ow 	 	at	the	time	that	I	was	 read 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	it	was	the	middle	of	the	winter	and	I	 definite 	 ly 	 	did	not	have	room	for	a	lot	of	dirt	in	my	New	York	City	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	.
So	I	was	 bas 	 ically 	 	just	 will 	 ing 	 	to	settle	for	just	 read 	 ing 	 	the	next	 Wire 	 d 	 	magazine	and	 find 	 ing 	 	out	how	the	 expert 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	figure	out	how	to	solve	all	these	 problem 	 s 	 	for	us	in	the	future	.
But	that	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	point	that	Michael	 Poll 	 an 	 	was	making	in	 th 	 is 	 	article	--	was	it	's	 precise 	 ly 	 	when	we	hand	over	the	 respons 	 ibility 	 	for	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	to	 special 	 ists 	 	that	we	cause	the	kind	of	 mess 	 es 	 	that	we	see	with	the	food	system	.
So	,	I	happen	to	know	a	little	bit	from	my	own	work	about	how	 NAS 	 A 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	using	 hydroponic 	 s 	 	to	explore	growing	food	in	space	.
And	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	get	optimal	 nutrition 	 al 	 	yield	by	running	a	kind	of	 high 	 - 	 quality 	 	liquid	 s 	 oil 	 	over	 plant 	 s 	 	'	root	 system 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	to	a	 veget 	 able 	 	plant	,	my	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	got	to	be	about	 a 	 s 	 	foreign	 a 	 s 	 	 out 	 er 	 	space	.
But	I	can	 off 	 er 	 	some	natural	light	and	 year 	 - 	 round 	 	climate	control	.
 Fast 	 - 	 forward 	 	two	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	:	we	now	have	window	 farm 	 s 	 	,	which	are	 vert 	 ical 	 	,	hydroponic	 platform 	 s 	 	for	 food 	 - 	 growing 	 	 in 	 door 	 s 	 	.
And	the	way	it	 work 	 s 	 	is	that	there	's	a	pump	at	the	bottom	,	which	 period 	 ically 	 	 s 	 end 	 s 	 	some	of	 th 	 is 	 	liquid	nutrient	solution	up	to	the	top	,	which	then	 trick 	 les 	 	down	through	 plant 	 s 	 	'	root	 system 	 s 	 	that	are	 suspend 	 ed 	 	in	clay	 pel 	 lets 	 	--	so	there	's	no	dirt	 involve 	 d 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	light	and	temperature	vary	with	each	window	's	 micro 	 climate 	 	,	so	a	window	farm	 requir 	 es 	 	a	 farm 	 er 	 	,	and	she	must	decide	what	kind	of	 crop 	 s 	 	she	is	going	to	put	in	her	window	farm	,	and	 whet 	 her 	 	she	is	going	to	feed	her	food	 organ 	 ically 	 	.
Back	at	the	time	,	a	window	farm	was	no	more	than	a	 technical 	 ly 	 	complex	idea	that	was	going	to	 requir 	 e 	 	a	lot	of	 test 	 ing 	 	.
And	I	 re 	 ally 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	it	to	be	an	open	project	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 hydroponic 	 s 	 	is	one	of	the	 fast 	 est 	 	growing	 area 	 s 	 	of	 patent 	 ing 	 	in	the	 Unit 	 ed 	 	 Stat 	 es 	 	right	now	and	could	possibly	 be 	 come 	 	 an 	 other 	 	area	like	 Mon 	 s 	 ant 	 o 	 	,	where	we	have	a	lot	of	corporate	intellectual	 proper 	 ty 	 	in	the	way	of	people	's	food	.
So	I	 decide 	 d 	 	that	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	creating	a	product	,	what	I	was	going	to	do	was	open	 th 	 is 	 	up	to	a	whole	bunch	of	 co 	 - 	 develop 	 ers 	 	.
The	first	few	 system 	 s 	 	that	we	 create 	 d 	 	,	they	kind	of	 work 	 ed 	 	.
We	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	able	to	grow	about	a	 s 	 al 	 ad 	 	a	week	in	a	typical	New	York	City	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	window	.
And	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	grow	 cher 	 ry 	 	 tomato 	 es 	 	and	 cucumber 	 s 	 	,	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	stuff	.
But	the	first	few	 system 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	these	 leak 	 y 	 	,	loud	 power 	 - 	 guzzl 	 ers 	 	that	 Mart 	 ha 	 	 Stew 	 art 	 	would	 definite 	 ly 	 	never	have	approved	.
So	to	 br 	 ing 	 	on	more	 co 	 - 	 develop 	 ers 	 	,	what	we	did	was	we	 create 	 d 	 	a	social	media	 s 	 ite 	 	on	which	we	 publish 	 ed 	 	the	 design 	 s 	 	,	we	 explain 	 ed 	 	how	they	 work 	 ed 	 	,	and	we	even	went	so	far	 a 	 s 	 	to	point	out	 every 	 thing 	 	that	was	wrong	with	these	 system 	 s 	 	.
And	then	we	 invit 	 ed 	 	people	all	over	the	world	to	build	them	and	experiment	with	us	.
So	 actual 	 ly 	 	now	on	 th 	 is 	 	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	,	we	have	18,000	people	.
And	we	have	window	 farm 	 s 	 	all	over	the	world	.
What	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	is	what	 NAS 	 A 	 	or	a	large	corporation	would	call	R	&	amp	;	D	,	or	research	and	 develop 	 ment 	 	.
But	what	we	call	it	is	R	&	amp	;	 D 	 - 	 I 	 - 	 Y 	 	,	or	research	and	develop	it	 your 	 self 	 	.
So	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 Jack 	 son 	 	came	 a 	 long 	 	and	 suggest 	 ed 	 	that	we	use	air	 pump 	 s 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	water	 pump 	 s 	 	.
It	took	building	a	whole	bunch	of	 system 	 s 	 	to	get	it	right	,	but	once	we	did	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	cut	our	carbon	 foot 	 print 	 	 near 	 ly 	 	in	half	.
 T 	 ony 	 	in	 Chi 	 cago 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	taking	on	growing	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	like	 lot 	 s 	 	of	other	window	 farm 	 ers 	 	,	and	he	's	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	get	his	 straw 	 berries 	 	to	fruit	for	nine	 month 	 s 	 	of	the	year	in	 low 	 - 	 light 	 	 condition 	 s 	 	by	 simpl 	 y 	 	changing	out	the	 organ 	 ic 	 	 nutrient 	 s 	 	.
And	window	 farm 	 ers 	 	in	 Fin 	 land 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 custom 	 izing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	window	 farm 	 s 	 	for	the	dark	 day 	 s 	 	of	the	 Finn 	 ish 	 	 winter 	 s 	 	by	 out 	 fitting 	 	them	with	LED	grow	 light 	 s 	 	that	they	're	now	making	open	source	and	part	of	the	project	.
So	window	 farm 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 evolv 	 ing 	 	through	a	rapid	 version 	 ing 	 	process	similar	to	 soft 	 ware 	 	.
And	with	every	open	source	project	,	the	real	benefit	is	the	 inter 	 play 	 	between	the	specific	 concern 	 s 	 	of	people	 custom 	 izing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 system 	 s 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 part 	 icular 	 	 concern 	 s 	 	and	the	universal	 concern 	 s 	 	.
So	my	core	team	and	I	are	able	to	 concent 	 rate 	 	on	the	 improve 	 ments 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	benefit	 every 	 one 	 	.
And	we	're	able	to	look	out	for	the	 need 	 s 	 	of	 new 	 com 	 ers 	 	.
So	for	 do 	 - 	 it 	 - 	 your 	 self 	 ers 	 	,	we	provide	free	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 well 	 - 	 tested 	 	 instruct 	 ions 	 	so	that	 any 	 one 	 	,	 any 	 where 	 	around	the	world	,	can	build	one	of	these	 system 	 s 	 	for	free	.
And	there	's	a	patent	 pend 	 ing 	 	on	these	 system 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	that	's	held	by	the	community	.
And	to	fund	the	project	,	we	partner	to	create	 product 	 s 	 	that	we	then	sell	to	 school 	 s 	 	and	to	 individual 	 s 	 	who	do	n't	have	time	to	build	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 system 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	 with 	 in 	 	our	community	,	a	certain	culture	 ha 	 s 	 	 appear 	 ed 	 	.
In	our	culture	,	it	is	better	to	be	a	 test 	 er 	 	who	 support 	 s 	 	 some 	 one 	 	else	's	idea	than	it	is	to	be	just	the	idea	guy	.
What	we	get	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	project	is	we	get	support	for	our	own	work	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	an	experience	of	 actual 	 ly 	 	 con 	 trib 	 uting 	 	to	the	 environment 	 al 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	in	a	way	other	than	just	 screw 	 ing 	 	in	new	light	 bulb 	 s 	 	.
But	I	think	that	Eileen	 express 	 es 	 	best	what	we	 re 	 ally 	 	get	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	which	is	the	actual	joy	of	 collabor 	 ation 	 	.
So	she	 express 	 es 	 	here	what	it	's	like	to	see	 some 	 one 	 	 half 	 way 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	world	 hav 	 ing 	 	taken	your	idea	,	built	 up 	 on 	 	it	and	then	 acknowledg 	 ing 	 	you	for	 con 	 trib 	 uting 	 	.
If	we	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	see	the	kind	of	wide	consumer	behavior	change	that	we	're	all	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 a 	 s 	 	 environment 	 alist 	 s 	 	and	food	people	,	 may 	 be 	 	we	just	need	to	 d 	 itch 	 	the	term	``	consumer	''	and	get	 be 	 hind 	 	the	people	who	are	 do 	 ing 	 	stuff	.
Open	source	 project 	 s 	 	tend	to	have	a	 moment 	 um 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	.
And	what	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	is	that	R	&	amp	;	 D 	 - 	 I 	 - 	 Y 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 move 	 d 	 	beyond	just	window	 farm 	 s 	 	and	 LED 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	solar	 pan 	 el 	 s 	 	and	aquaponic	 system 	 s 	 	.
And	we	're	building	 up 	 on 	 	 innov 	 ations 	 	of	 generation 	 s 	 	who	went	before	us	.
And	we	're	looking	 a 	 head 	 	at	 generation 	 s 	 	who	 re 	 ally 	 	need	us	to	 re 	 tool 	 	our	 live 	 s 	 	now	.
So	we	ask	that	you	join	us	in	 re 	 discover 	 ing 	 	the	value	of	 citizen 	 s 	 	 unit 	 ed 	 	,	and	to	declare	that	we	are	all	still	 pioneer 	 s 	 	.
When	I	was	little	--	and	by	the	way	,	I	was	little	once	--	my	father	told	me	a	story	about	an	18th	century	 watch 	 maker 	 	.
And	what	 th 	 is 	 	guy	had	 d 	 one 	 	:	he	used	to	produce	these	 fabulous 	 ly 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 watch 	 es 	 	.
And	one	day	,	one	of	his	 custom 	 ers 	 	came	 in 	 to 	 	his	 work 	 shop 	 	and	 ask 	 ed 	 	him	to	clean	the	watch	that	he	'd	 b 	 ought 	 	.
And	the	guy	took	it	 a 	 part 	 	,	and	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	he	 pull 	 ed 	 	out	was	one	of	the	balance	 wheel 	 s 	 	.
And	 a 	 s 	 	he	did	so	,	his	 custom 	 er 	 	 notice 	 d 	 	that	on	the	back	side	of	the	balance	wheel	was	an	 engrav 	 ing 	 	,	 we 	 re 	 	 word 	 s 	 	.
And	he	 s 	 aid 	 	to	the	guy	,	``	Why	have	you	put	stuff	on	the	back	that	no	one	will	ever	see	?	''
And	the	 watch 	 maker 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	around	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	God	can	see	it	.	''
 N 	 ow 	 	I	'm	not	in	the	 l 	 east 	 	bit	religious	,	 n 	 either 	 	was	my	father	,	but	at	that	point	,	I	 notice 	 d 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	here	.
I	felt	 some 	 thing 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 plex 	 us 	 	of	blood	 vessel 	 s 	 	and	 nerve 	 s 	 	,	and	there	must	be	some	 muscle 	 s 	 	in	there	 a 	 s 	 	well	 some 	 where 	 	,	I	guess	.
But	I	felt	 some 	 thing 	 	.
And	it	was	a	 physiologic 	 al 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	.
And	from	that	point	on	,	from	my	age	at	the	time	,	I	 beg 	 an 	 	to	think	of	 thing 	 s 	 	in	a	different	way	.
And	 a 	 s 	 	I	took	on	my	 care 	 er 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 design 	 er 	 	,	I	 beg 	 an 	 	to	ask	 my 	 self 	 	the	simple	question	:	Do	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	think	 beaut 	 y 	 	,	or	do	we	feel	it	?
 N 	 ow 	 	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	know	the	answer	to	 th 	 is 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	.
You	 prob 	 ably 	 	think	,	well	,	I	do	n't	know	which	one	you	think	it	is	,	but	I	think	it	's	about	 feel 	 ing 	 	 beaut 	 y 	 	.
And	so	I	then	 move 	 d 	 	on	 in 	 to 	 	my	design	 care 	 er 	 	and	 beg 	 an 	 	to	find	some	 excit 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
One	of	the	most	early	work	was	 d 	 one 	 	in	 auto 	 motive 	 	design	--	some	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	work	was	 d 	 one 	 	there	.
And	 dur 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	 th 	 is 	 	work	,	we	found	 some 	 thing 	 	,	or	I	found	 some 	 thing 	 	,	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 fascinate 	 d 	 	me	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	you	can	remember	it	.
Do	you	remember	when	 light 	 s 	 	used	to	just	go	on	and	off	,	click	click	,	when	you	closed	the	door	in	a	car	?
And	then	 some 	 body 	 	,	I	think	it	was	BMW	,	 introduc 	 ed 	 	a	light	that	went	out	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	.
 Re 	 member 	 	that	?
I	remember	it	 clear 	 ly 	 	.
Do	you	remember	the	first	time	you	 we 	 re 	 	in	a	car	and	it	did	that	?
I	remember	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	 think 	 ing 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	fantastic	.
In	fact	,	I	've	never	found	 any 	 body 	 	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	like	the	light	that	 go 	 es 	 	out	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	.
I	thought	,	well	what	the	hell	's	that	about	?
So	I	 start 	 ed 	 	to	ask	 my 	 self 	 	 question 	 s 	 	about	it	.
And	the	first	was	,	I	'd	ask	other	people	:	``	Do	you	like	it	?	''	``	Yes	.	''
``	Why	?	''	And	they	'd	say	,	``	Oh	,	it	 feel 	 s 	 	so	natural	,	''	or	,	``	It	's	nice	.	''
I	thought	,	well	that	's	not	good	 en 	 ough 	 	.
Can	we	cut	down	a	little	bit	further	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	 design 	 er 	 	,	I	need	the	 vocabul 	 ary 	 	,	I	need	the	 key 	 board 	 	,	of	how	 th 	 is 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 work 	 s 	 	.
And	so	I	did	some	 experiment 	 s 	 	.
And	I	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 real 	 ized 	 	that	there	was	 some 	 thing 	 	that	did	 exact 	 ly 	 	that	--	light	to	dark	in	six	 second 	 s 	 	--	 exact 	 ly 	 	that	.
Do	you	know	what	it	is	?	 Any 	 one 	 	?
You	see	,	using	 th 	 is 	 	bit	,	the	 think 	 y 	 	bit	,	the	 s 	 low 	 	bit	of	the	brain	--	using	that	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	a	think	,	it	's	a	feel	.
And	would	you	do	me	a	favor	?
For	the	next	14	 minute 	 s 	 	or	 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	,	will	you	feel	stuff	?
I	do	n't	need	you	to	think	so	much	 a 	 s 	 	I	want	you	to	feel	it	.
I	felt	a	sense	of	 relax 	 ation 	 	 temper 	 ed 	 	with	 anticip 	 ation 	 	.
And	that	thing	that	I	found	was	the	cinema	or	the	theater	.
It	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	just	 happen 	 ed 	 	here	--	light	to	dark	in	six	 second 	 s 	 	.
And	when	that	 happen 	 s 	 	,	are	you	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	going	,	``	No	,	the	movie	's	about	to	start	,	''	or	are	you	going	,	``	That	's	fantastic	.	I	'm	looking	forward	to	it	.
I	get	a	sense	of	 anticip 	 ation 	 	''	?
 N 	 ow 	 	I	'm	not	a	 neuro 	 scientist 	 	.
I	do	n't	know	even	if	there	is	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	a	 condition 	 ed 	 	 re 	 flex 	 	.
But	it	might	be	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	the	people	I	speak	to	in	the	 north 	 ern 	 	 hemi 	 sphere 	 	that	used	to	go	in	the	cinema	get	 th 	 is 	 	.
And	some	of	the	people	I	speak	to	that	have	never	 s 	 een 	 	a	movie	or	 be 	 en 	 	to	the	theater	do	n't	get	it	in	the	same	way	.
 Every 	 body 	 	 like 	 s 	 	it	,	but	some	like	it	more	than	 other 	 s 	 	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	 lead 	 s 	 	me	to	think	of	 th 	 is 	 	in	a	different	way	.
We	're	not	 feel 	 ing 	 	it	.	We	're	 think 	 ing 	 	 beaut 	 y 	 	is	in	the	 limb 	 ic 	 	system	--	if	that	's	not	an	 out 	 mod 	 ed 	 	idea	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	the	bits	,	the	pleasure	 center 	 s 	 	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	what	I	'm	 see 	 ing 	 	and	 sens 	 ing 	 	and	 feel 	 ing 	 	is	 bypass 	 ing 	 	my	 think 	 ing 	 	.
The	wiring	from	your	 sensor 	 y 	 	apparatus	to	 t 	 hose 	 	bits	is	 short 	 er 	 	than	the	bits	that	have	to	pass	through	the	 think 	 y 	 	bit	,	the	cortex	.
 The 	 y 	 	 arriv 	 e 	 	first	.
So	how	do	we	make	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	work	?
And	how	much	of	that	 re 	 active 	 	side	of	it	is	due	to	what	we	 al 	 ready 	 	know	,	or	what	we	're	going	to	learn	,	about	 some 	 thing 	 	?
 Th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	most	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	I	know	.
It	's	a	plastic	bag	.
And	when	I	 look 	 ed 	 	at	it	first	,	I	thought	,	no	,	there	's	no	 beaut 	 y 	 	in	that	.
 Th 	 en 	 	I	found	out	,	post	 expo 	 s 	 ure 	 	,	that	 th 	 is 	 	plastic	bag	if	I	put	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	 filth 	 y 	 	 pudd 	 le 	 	or	a	stream	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	 coli 	 form 	 s 	 	and	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 disgust 	 ing 	 	stuff	,	that	that	 filth 	 y 	 	water	will	 migr 	 ate 	 	through	the	wall	of	the	bag	by	osmosis	and	end	up	 in 	 side 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	 pur 	 e 	 	,	 pot 	 able 	 	 drink 	 ing 	 	water	.
And	all	of	a	sudden	,	 th 	 is 	 	plastic	bag	was	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	to	me	.
 N 	 ow 	 	I	'm	going	to	ask	you	 aga 	 in 	 	to	 s 	 witch 	 	on	the	 emotion 	 al 	 	bit	.
Would	you	mind	taking	the	brain	out	,	and	I	just	want	you	to	feel	 some 	 thing 	 	.
Look	at	that	.	What	are	you	 feel 	 ing 	 	about	it	?
 I 	 s 	 	it	 beaut 	 iful 	 	?	 I 	 s 	 	it	 excit 	 ing 	 	?
I	'm	 watch 	 ing 	 	your	 face 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 care 	 fully 	 	.
There	's	some	 ra 	 ther 	 	 bor 	 ed 	 - 	 looking 	 	 gentle 	 men 	 	and	some	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	 engag 	 ed 	 - 	 looking 	 	 lad 	 ies 	 	who	are	 pick 	 ing 	 	up	 some 	 thing 	 	off	that	.
 May 	 be 	 	there	's	an	 innoc 	 ence 	 	to	it	.
 N 	 ow 	 	I	'm	going	to	tell	you	what	it	is	.	 A 	 re 	 	you	ready	?
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	last	act	on	 th 	 is 	 	Earth	of	a	little	girl	 call 	 ed 	 	 He 	 idi 	 	,	five	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	before	she	 di 	 ed 	 	of	cancer	to	the	 s 	 pine 	 	.
It	's	the	last	thing	she	did	,	the	last	physical	act	.
Look	at	that	picture	.
Look	at	the	 innoc 	 ence 	 	.	Look	at	the	 beaut 	 y 	 	in	it	.
 I 	 s 	 	it	 beaut 	 iful 	 	now	?
 S 	 top 	 	.	 S 	 top 	 	.	How	do	you	feel	?
Where	are	you	 feel 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	?
I	'm	 feel 	 ing 	 	it	here	.	I	feel	it	here	.
And	I	'm	 watch 	 ing 	 	your	 face 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	your	 face 	 s 	 	are	 tell 	 ing 	 	me	 some 	 thing 	 	.
The	 lad 	 y 	 	over	there	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 cry 	 ing 	 	,	by	the	way	.
But	what	are	you	 do 	 ing 	 	?
I	watch	what	people	do	.
I	watch	 face 	 s 	 	.
I	watch	 react 	 ions 	 	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	I	have	to	know	how	people	react	to	 thing 	 s 	 	.
And	one	of	the	most	common	 face 	 s 	 	on	 some 	 thing 	 	 face 	 d 	 	with	 beaut 	 y 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	 stupefy 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 delic 	 ious 	 	,	is	what	I	call	the	 O 	 MG 	 	.
And	by	the	way	,	there	's	no	pleasure	in	that	face	.
It	's	not	a	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	 wonder 	 ful 	 	!	''
The	 eye 	 brow 	 s 	 	are	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	the	 eye 	 s 	 	are	 de 	 focused 	 	,	and	the	mouth	is	 hang 	 ing 	 	open	.
That	's	not	the	 express 	 ion 	 	of	joy	.
There	's	 some 	 thing 	 	else	in	that	.
There	's	 some 	 thing 	 	weird	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
So	pleasure	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	 temper 	 ed 	 	by	a	whole	 s 	 eries 	 	of	different	 thing 	 s 	 	coming	in	.
 Poign 	 ancy 	 	is	a	word	I	love	 a 	 s 	 	a	 design 	 er 	 	.
It	 mean 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 trigger 	 ing 	 	a	big	 emotion 	 al 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	,	often	 quit 	 e 	 	a	 s 	 ad 	 	 emotion 	 al 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	,	but	it	's	part	of	what	we	do	.
It	is	n't	just	about	nice	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	dilemma	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	paradox	,	of	 beaut 	 y 	 	.
 Sen 	 s 	 or 	 ily 	 	,	we	're	taking	in	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	--	 mix 	 ture 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	good	,	bad	,	 excit 	 ing 	 	,	 frighten 	 ing 	 	--	to	come	up	with	that	 sensor 	 ial 	 	 expo 	 s 	 ure 	 	,	that	 sens 	 ation 	 	of	what	's	going	on	.
 Path 	 os 	 	 appear 	 s 	 	 obvious 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	part	of	what	you	just	saw	in	that	little	girl	's	 draw 	 ing 	 	.
And	 al 	 so 	 	triumph	,	 th 	 is 	 	sense	of	 transcend 	 ence 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	``	I	never	 k 	 new 	 	that	.	Ah	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	new	.	''
And	that	's	 pack 	 ed 	 	in	there	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
And	 a 	 s 	 	we	assemble	these	 tool 	 s 	 	,	from	a	design	point	of	view	,	I	get	 terr 	 ibly 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	these	are	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	've	 al 	 ready 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	they	're	 arriv 	 ing 	 	at	the	brain	,	it	would	seem	,	before	cognition	,	before	we	can	 manipul 	 ate 	 	them	--	 electro 	 chemical 	 	party	 trick 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	what	I	'm	 al 	 so 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	is	:	 I 	 s 	 	it	possible	to	 separat 	 e 	 	intrinsic	and	 extr 	 in 	 s 	 ic 	 	 beaut 	 y 	 	?
By	that	,	I	mean	 intrinsic 	 ally 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	just	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	 exquisite 	 ly 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	that	's	 universal 	 ly 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
 Ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	find	.	 May 	 be 	 	you	've	got	some	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	it	.
 Ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	find	 some 	 thing 	 	that	,	to	 every 	 body 	 	,	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	thing	,	 with 	 out 	 	a	certain	amount	of	information	 pack 	 ed 	 	in	there	before	.
So	a	lot	of	it	 tend 	 s 	 	to	be	 extr 	 in 	 s 	 ic 	 	.
It	's	 mediate 	 d 	 	by	information	before	the	 comprehens 	 ion 	 	.
Or	the	information	's	 add 	 ed 	 	on	at	the	back	,	like	that	little	girl	's	 draw 	 ing 	 	that	I	 show 	 ed 	 	you	.
 N 	 ow 	 	when	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 beaut 	 y 	 	you	ca	n't	get	away	from	the	fact	that	a	lot	 experiment 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 d 	 one 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	with	 face 	 s 	 	and	what	have	you	.
And	one	of	the	most	 ted 	 ious 	 	 one 	 s 	 	,	I	think	,	was	 say 	 ing 	 	that	 beaut 	 y 	 	was	about	symmetry	.
Well	it	 obvious 	 ly 	 	is	n't	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	one	where	half	 face 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 show 	 n 	 	to	some	people	,	and	then	to	add	them	 in 	 to 	 	a	list	of	most	 beaut 	 iful 	 	to	 l 	 east 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	and	then	 ex 	 posing 	 	a	full	face	.
And	they	found	that	it	was	 al 	 most 	 	exact	 co 	 incidence 	 	.
So	it	was	n't	about	symmetry	.
In	fact	,	 th 	 is 	 	 lad 	 y 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 a 	 symmetric 	 al 	 	face	,	of	which	both	 side 	 s 	 	are	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
But	they	're	both	different	.
And	 a 	 s 	 	a	 design 	 er 	 	,	I	ca	n't	help	 meddl 	 ing 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	,	so	I	 pull 	 ed 	 	it	to	bits	and	sort	of	did	stuff	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	understand	what	the	individual	 element 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	,	but	 feel 	 ing 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	I	go	.
