 She 	 a 	 	 Hem 	 brey 	 	:	How	I	 be 	 came 	 	100	 artist 	 s 	 
I	'm	a	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	artist	with	a	bit	of	an	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	 back 	 ground 	 	.
I	was	in	my	20s	before	I	ever	went	to	an	art	museum	.
I	grew	up	in	the	middle	of	 no 	 where 	 	on	a	dirt	road	in	 r 	 ural 	 	 Ark 	 ansas 	 	,	an	hour	from	the	 near 	 est 	 	movie	theater	.
And	I	think	it	was	a	great	place	to	grow	up	 a 	 s 	 	an	artist	 be 	 cause 	 	I	grew	up	around	 quirk 	 y 	 	,	 color 	 ful 	 	 character 	 s 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	great	at	making	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	.
And	my	 child 	 hood 	 	is	more	hick	than	I	could	ever	possibly	 re 	 late 	 	to	you	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	more	intellectual	than	you	would	ever	expect	.
For	 in 	 stance 	 	,	me	and	my	sister	,	when	we	 we 	 re 	 	little	,	we	would	compete	to	see	who	could	eat	the	most	squirrel	 brain 	 s 	 	.
But	on	the	other	side	of	that	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	big	 read 	 ers 	 	in	our	house	.
And	if	the	TV	was	on	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	 watch 	 ing 	 	a	 document 	 ary 	 	.
And	my	dad	is	the	most	 vor 	 acious 	 	 read 	 er 	 	I	know	.
He	can	read	a	novel	or	two	a	day	.
But	when	I	was	little	,	I	remember	,	he	would	kill	flies	in	our	house	with	my	BB	gun	.
And	what	was	so	 amaz 	 ing 	 	to	me	about	that	--	well	he	would	be	in	his	 recline 	 r 	 	,	would	holler	for	me	to	fetch	the	BB	gun	,	and	I	'd	go	get	it	.
And	what	was	 amaz 	 ing 	 	to	me	--	well	it	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	 kick 	 ass 	 	;	he	was	 kill 	 ing 	 	a	fly	in	the	house	with	a	gun	--	but	what	was	so	 amaz 	 ing 	 	to	me	was	that	he	 k 	 new 	 	just	 en 	 ough 	 	how	to	pump	it	.
And	he	could	shoot	it	from	two	rooms	away	and	not	damage	what	it	was	on	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 k 	 new 	 	how	to	pump	it	just	 en 	 ough 	 	to	kill	the	fly	and	not	damage	what	it	 land 	 ed 	 	on	.
So	I	should	talk	about	art	.
Or	we	'll	be	here	all	day	with	my	 child 	 hood 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	.
I	love	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	art	,	but	I	'm	often	 re 	 ally 	 	 frust 	 rated 	 	with	the	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	art	world	and	the	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	art	scene	.
A	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	I	 s 	 pent 	 	 month 	 s 	 	in	 Euro 	 pe 	 	to	see	the	major	 inter 	 national 	 	art	 exhibit 	 ions 	 	that	have	the	 puls 	 e 	 	of	what	is	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	going	on	in	the	art	world	.
And	I	was	 s 	 truck 	 	by	going	to	so	 man 	 y 	 	,	one	after	the	other	,	with	some	 clar 	 ity 	 	of	what	it	was	that	I	was	 long 	 ing 	 	for	.
And	I	was	 long 	 ing 	 	for	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	I	was	n't	 get 	 ting 	 	,	or	not	 get 	 ting 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	of	.
But	two	of	the	main	 thing 	 s 	 	:	one	of	it	,	I	was	 long 	 ing 	 	for	more	work	that	was	 appeal 	 ing 	 	to	a	broad	public	,	that	was	 access 	 ible 	 	.
And	the	second	thing	that	I	was	 long 	 ing 	 	for	was	some	more	exquisite	 craft 	 s 	 man 	 ship 	 	and	 techni 	 que 	 	.
So	I	 start 	 ed 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	and	 list 	 ing 	 	what	all	it	was	that	I	thought	would	make	a	perfect	biennial	.
So	I	 decide 	 d 	 	,	I	'm	going	to	start	my	own	biennial	.
I	'm	going	to	organize	it	and	direct	it	and	get	it	going	in	the	world	.
So	I	thought	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	I	have	to	have	some	 cri 	 ter 	 ia 	 	of	how	to	 choos 	 e 	 	work	.
So	 among 	 st 	 	all	the	 cri 	 ter 	 ia 	 	I	have	,	there	's	two	main	 thing 	 s 	 	.
One	of	them	,	I	call	my	Mimaw	's	 T 	 est 	 	.
And	what	that	is	is	I	imagine	 explain 	 ing 	 	a	work	of	art	to	my	 grand 	 mother 	 	in	five	 minute 	 s 	 	,	and	if	I	ca	n't	explain	it	in	five	 minute 	 s 	 	,	then	it	's	too	 obt 	 use 	 	or	esoteric	and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 be 	 en 	 	 refine 	 d 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	yet	.
It	 need 	 s 	 	to	 work 	 ed 	 	on	 un 	 til 	 	it	can	speak	 fluent 	 ly 	 	.
And	then	my	other	second	set	of	 rule 	 s 	 	--	I	hate	to	say	``	 rule 	 s 	 	''	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	art	--	my	 cri 	 ter 	 ia 	 	would	be	the	three	H	's	,	which	is	head	,	heart	and	 hand 	 s 	 	.
And	great	art	would	have	``	head	''	:	it	would	have	 interest 	 ing 	 	intellectual	 idea 	 s 	 	and	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	.
It	would	have	``	heart	''	in	that	it	would	have	 pass 	 ion 	 	and	heart	and	soul	.
And	it	would	have	``	hand	''	in	that	it	would	be	 great 	 ly 	 	 craft 	 ed 	 	.
So	I	 start 	 ed 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	how	am	I	going	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	biennial	,	how	am	I	going	to	travel	the	world	and	find	these	 artist 	 s 	 	?
And	then	I	 real 	 ized 	 	one	day	,	there	's	an	 eas 	 ier 	 	solution	to	 th 	 is 	 	.
I	'm	just	going	to	make	the	whole	thing	 my 	 self 	 	.
And	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	I	did	.
So	I	thought	,	a	biennial	 need 	 s 	 	 artist 	 s 	 	.
I	'm	going	to	do	an	 inter 	 national 	 	biennial	;	I	need	 artist 	 s 	 	from	all	around	the	world	.
So	what	I	did	was	I	 invent 	 ed 	 	a	hundred	 artist 	 s 	 	from	around	the	world	.
I	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	 the 	 ir 	 	 bio 	 s 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 pass 	 ions 	 	in	life	and	 the 	 ir 	 	art	 style 	 s 	 	,	and	I	 start 	 ed 	 	making	 the 	 ir 	 	work	.
I	felt	,	oh	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	kind	of	project	that	I	could	 s 	 pend 	 	my	whole	life	 do 	 ing 	 	.
So	I	 decide 	 d 	 	,	I	'm	going	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	a	real	biennial	.
It	's	going	to	be	two	 year 	 s 	 	of	studio	work	.
And	I	'm	going	to	create	 th 	 is 	 	in	two	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	I	have	.
So	I	should	start	to	talk	about	these	 guy 	 s 	 	.
Well	the	range	is	 quit 	 e 	 	a	bit	.
And	I	'm	 s 	 uch 	 	a	technician	,	so	I	 love 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	project	,	 get 	 ting 	 	to	play	with	all	the	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	.
So	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	in	 re 	 alist 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	it	 range 	 s 	 	from	 th 	 is 	 	,	which	is	kind	of	old	 master 	 s 	 	style	,	to	 re 	 ally 	 	realistic	 still 	 - 	 life 	 	,	to	 th 	 is 	 	type	of	 paint 	 ing 	 	where	I	'm	 paint 	 ing 	 	with	a	single	hair	.
And	then	at	the	other	end	,	there	's	performance	and	short	 film 	 s 	 	and	 in 	 door 	 	 install 	 ations 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 door 	 	 install 	 ation 	 	and	 th 	 is 	 	one	,	and	 out 	 door 	 	 install 	 ations 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	one	and	 th 	 is 	 	one	.
I	know	I	should	 ment 	 ion 	 	:	I	'm	making	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	n't	 Photo 	 s 	 hopped 	 	.
I	'm	under	the	river	with	 t 	 hose 	 	fish	.
So	now	let	me	 introduc 	 e 	 	some	of	my	 fiction 	 al 	 	 artist 	 s 	 	to	you	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 N 	 ell 	 	 Rem 	 mel 	 	.
 N 	 ell 	 	is	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 agricultur 	 al 	 	 process 	 es 	 	,	and	her	work	is	based	in	these	 practice 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	piece	,	which	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 F 	 lipped 	 	Earth	''	--	she	was	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	taking	the	sky	and	using	it	to	 clean 	 s 	 e 	 	 bar 	 ren 	 	ground	.
And	by	taking	giant	 mirror 	 s 	 	--	and	here	she	's	taking	giant	 mirror 	 s 	 	and	 pull 	 ing 	 	them	 in 	 to 	 	the	dirt	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	22	feet	long	.
And	what	I	 love 	 d 	 	about	her	work	is	,	when	I	would	walk	around	it	and	look	down	 in 	 to 	 	the	sky	,	looking	down	to	watch	the	sky	,	and	it	 un 	 fold 	 ed 	 	in	a	new	way	.
And	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	best	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	piece	is	at	 du 	 s 	 k 	 	and	dawn	when	the	 t 	 wi 	 light 	 	wedge	 ha 	 s 	 	 fall 	 en 	 	and	the	ground	's	dark	,	but	there	's	still	the	light	above	,	bright	above	.
And	so	you	're	 stand 	 ing 	 	there	and	 every 	 thing 	 	else	is	dark	,	but	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	 port 	 al 	 	that	you	want	to	jump	in	.
 Th 	 is 	 	piece	was	great	.	 Th 	 is 	 	is	in	my	 parent 	 s 	 	'	 back 	 yard 	 	in	 Ark 	 ansas 	 	.
And	I	love	to	dig	a	hole	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	piece	was	great	 f 	 un 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	two	 day 	 s 	 	of	 dig 	 ging 	 	in	soft	dirt	.
The	next	artist	is	Kay	 Over 	 stry 	 	,	and	she	's	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 ephemeral 	 ity 	 	and	 trans 	 i 	 ence 	 	.
And	in	her	most	 re 	 cent 	 	project	,	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	Weather	I	 Mad 	 e 	 	.	''
And	she	's	making	weather	on	her	body	's	scale	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	piece	is	``	Frost	.	''
And	what	she	did	was	she	went	out	on	a	cold	,	dry	night	and	 breath 	 ed 	 	back	and	forth	on	the	lawn	to	 leav 	 e 	 	--	to	 leav 	 e 	 	her	life	's	mark	,	the	mark	of	her	life	.
And	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	 five 	 - 	 foot 	 	,	 five 	 - 	 inch 	 es 	 	of	frost	that	she	left	 be 	 hind 	 	.
The	 s 	 un 	 	 rise 	 s 	 	,	and	it	 melt 	 s 	 	away	.
And	that	was	 play 	 ed 	 	by	my	mom	.
So	the	next	artist	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	group	of	 Japan 	 ese 	 	 artist 	 s 	 	,	a	 collect 	 ive 	 	of	 Japan 	 ese 	 	 artist 	 s 	 	--	in	 To 	 kyo 	 	.
And	they	 we 	 re 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 develop 	 ing 	 	a	new	,	 alter 	 native 	 	art	space	,	and	they	 need 	 ed 	 	 fund 	 ing 	 	for	it	,	so	they	 decide 	 d 	 	to	come	up	with	some	 interest 	 ing 	 	 fund 	 raising 	 	 project 	 s 	 	.
One	of	these	is	 scratch 	 - 	 off 	 	 master 	 piece 	 s 	 	.
And	so	what	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	--	each	of	these	 artist 	 s 	 	on	a	 nine 	 - 	 by 	 - 	 seven 	 - 	 inch 	 	card	,	which	they	sell	for	10	 buck 	 s 	 	,	they	drew	original	 work 	 s 	 	of	art	.
And	you	buy	one	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	you	get	a	real	piece	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	not	.
Well	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 spark 	 ed 	 	a	craze	in	Japan	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 every 	 one 	 	's	 want 	 ing 	 	a	 master 	 piece 	 	.
And	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	are	the	most	 s 	 ought 	 	after	are	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	are	 on 	 ly 	 	 bare 	 ly 	 	 scratch 	 ed 	 	off	.
And	all	these	 work 	 s 	 	,	in	some	way	,	talk	about	luck	or	fate	or	chance	.
 T 	 hose 	 	first	two	are	 portrait 	 s 	 	of	 mega 	 - 	 jack 	 pot 	 	 winner 	 s 	 	 year 	 s 	 	before	and	after	 the 	 ir 	 	win	.
And	in	 th 	 is 	 	one	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 D 	 raw 	 ing 	 	the	Short	Stick	.	''
I	love	 th 	 is 	 	piece	 be 	 cause 	 	I	have	a	little	cousin	at	home	who	 introduc 	 ed 	 	me	--	which	I	think	is	 s 	 uch 	 	a	great	 introduc 	 tion 	 	--	to	a	friend	one	day	 a 	 s 	 	,	``	 Th 	 is 	 	is	my	cousin	 She 	 a 	 	.
He	 draw 	 s 	 	 stick 	 s 	 	real	good	.	''
 Whi 	 ch 	 	is	one	of	the	best	 compliment 	 s 	 	ever	.
 Th 	 is 	 	artist	is	Gus	 Wein 	 mueller 	 	,	and	he	's	 do 	 ing 	 	a	project	,	a	large	project	,	 call 	 ed 	 	``	Art	for	the	 People 	 s 	 	.	''
And	 with 	 in 	 	 th 	 is 	 	project	,	he	's	 do 	 ing 	 	a	 small 	 er 	 	project	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 Art 	 ists 	 	in	 Resi 	 d 	 ence 	 	.	''
And	what	he	 do 	 es 	 	is	--	he	 s 	 pend 	 s 	 	a	week	at	a	time	with	a	family	.
And	he	 show 	 s 	 	up	on	 the 	 ir 	 	porch	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 door 	 step 	 	,	with	a	 tooth 	 brush 	 	and	 pajama 	 s 	 	,	and	he	's	ready	to	 s 	 pend 	 	the	week	with	them	.
And	using	 on 	 ly 	 	what	's	present	,	he	 go 	 es 	 	in	and	 make 	 s 	 	a	little	 abo 	 de 	 	studio	to	work	out	of	.
And	he	 s 	 pend 	 s 	 	that	week	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	the	family	about	what	do	they	think	great	art	is	.
He	 ha 	 s 	 	all	these	 discuss 	 ions 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	family	,	and	he	 dig 	 s 	 	through	 every 	 thing 	 	they	have	,	and	he	 find 	 s 	 	 material 	 s 	 	to	make	work	.
And	he	 make 	 s 	 	a	work	that	 answer 	 s 	 	what	they	think	great	art	is	.
For	 th 	 is 	 	family	,	he	made	 th 	 is 	 	 still 	 - 	 life 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 	.
And	 what 	 ever 	 	he	 make 	 s 	 	 some 	 how 	 	 re 	 ference 	 s 	 	 nest 	 ing 	 	and	space	and	personal	 proper 	 ty 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	next	project	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	by	Jaochim	 Paris 	 vega 	 	,	and	he	's	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	--	he	 believ 	 es 	 	art	is	 every 	 where 	 	 wait 	 ing 	 	--	that	it	just	 need 	 s 	 	a	little	bit	of	a	push	to	happen	.
And	he	 provide 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	push	by	 harness 	 ing 	 	natural	 force 	 s 	 	,	like	in	his	 s 	 eries 	 	where	he	used	rain	to	make	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	project	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	Love	 N 	 est 	 s 	 	.	''
What	he	did	was	to	get	wild	 bird 	 s 	 	to	make	his	art	for	him	.
So	he	put	the	material	in	 place 	 s 	 	where	the	 bird 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	collect	them	,	and	they	 craft 	 ed 	 	his	 nest 	 s 	 	for	him	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	one	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 Love 	 lock 	 	's	 N 	 est 	 	.	''
 Th 	 is 	 	one	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 Mix 	 tape 	 	Love	Song	's	 N 	 est 	 	.	''
And	 th 	 is 	 	one	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 Love 	 making 	 	 N 	 est 	 	.	''
Next	is	Sylvia	 Sla 	 ter 	 	.
Sylvia	's	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	art	training	.
She	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	serious	Swiss	artist	.
And	she	was	 think 	 ing 	 	about	her	 friend 	 s 	 	and	family	who	work	in	 cha 	 os 	 - 	 ridden 	 	 place 	 s 	 	and	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	,	and	she	was	 think 	 ing 	 	,	what	can	I	make	that	would	be	of	value	to	them	,	in	case	 some 	 thing 	 	bad	 happen 	 s 	 	and	they	have	to	buy	 the 	 ir 	 	way	 a 	 cross 	 	the	border	or	pay	off	a	 gun 	 man 	 	?
And	so	she	came	up	with	creating	these	 pocket 	 - 	 sized 	 	 art 	 work 	 s 	 	that	are	 portrait 	 s 	 	of	the	person	that	would	carry	them	.
And	you	would	carry	 th 	 is 	 	around	with	you	,	and	if	 every 	 thing 	 	went	to	hell	,	you	could	make	 payment 	 s 	 	and	buy	your	life	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	life	price	is	for	an	 irrig 	 ation 	 	 non 	 - 	 profit 	 	director	.
So	 hope 	 fully 	 	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	you	never	use	it	,	and	it	's	an	 heir 	 loom 	 	that	you	pass	down	.
And	she	 make 	 s 	 	them	so	they	could	either	be	broken	up	 in 	 to 	 	 payment 	 s 	 	,	or	they	could	be	like	these	,	which	are	 leav 	 es 	 	that	can	be	 payment 	 s 	 	.
And	so	they	're	 valu 	 able 	 	.	 Th 	 is 	 	is	precious	 metal 	 s 	 	and	 gem 	 stone 	 s 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	one	had	to	get	broken	up	.
He	had	to	break	off	a	piece	to	get	out	of	Egypt	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	by	a	 du 	 o 	 	,	Michael	 Ab 	 er 	 na 	 thy 	 	and	Bud	 Hol 	 land 	 	.
And	they	're	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	creating	culture	,	just	tradition	.
So	what	they	do	is	they	move	 in 	 to 	 	an	area	and	try	to	establish	a	new	tradition	in	a	small	 geo 	 graphic 	 	area	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	is	in	 East 	 ern 	 	 Ten 	 ness 	 ee 	 	,	and	what	they	 decide 	 d 	 	was	that	we	need	a	positive	tradition	that	 go 	 es 	 	with	death	.
So	they	came	up	with	``	dig	 jig 	 s 	 	.	''
And	a	dig	jig	--	a	dig	jig	is	where	,	for	a	 mile 	 stone 	 	 annivers 	 ary 	 	or	a	 birth 	 day 	 	,	you	gather	all	your	 friend 	 s 	 	and	family	together	and	you	dance	on	where	you	're	going	to	be	buried	.
And	we	got	a	lot	of	attention	when	we	did	it	.
I	 talk 	 ed 	 	my	family	 in 	 to 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	they	did	n't	know	what	I	was	 do 	 ing 	 	.
And	I	was	like	,	``	Get	 dress 	 ed 	 	for	a	funeral	.	We	're	going	to	go	do	some	work	.	''
And	so	we	got	to	the	grave	and	made	 th 	 is 	 	,	which	was	hilarious	--	the	attention	that	we	got	.
So	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	you	dance	on	the	grave	,	and	after	you	've	 d 	 one 	 	your	dance	,	 every 	 one 	 	 toast 	 s 	 	you	and	 tell 	 s 	 	you	how	great	you	are	.
And	you	in	 es 	 s 	 ence 	 	have	a	funeral	that	you	get	to	be	present	for	.
That	's	my	mom	and	dad	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	by	 Ja 	 son 	 	 Bird 	 song 	 	.
He	is	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	how	we	see	 a 	 s 	 	an	animal	,	how	we	are	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	mimicry	and	camouflage	.
You	know	,	we	look	down	a	dark	 al 	 ley 	 	or	a	jungle	path	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	out	a	face	or	a	creature	.
We	just	have	that	natural	way	of	 see 	 ing 	 	.
And	he	 play 	 s 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	idea	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	piece	:	 t 	 hose 	 	are	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	 leav 	 es 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	 butter 	 fly 	 	 specimen 	 s 	 	who	have	a	natural	camouflage	.
So	he	 pair 	 s 	 	these	up	.
There	's	 an 	 other 	 	pile	of	 leav 	 es 	 	.
 T 	 hose 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	all	real	 butter 	 fly 	 	 specimen 	 s 	 	.
And	he	 pair 	 s 	 	these	up	with	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
Like	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 paint 	 ing 	 	of	a	snake	in	a	box	.
So	you	open	the	box	and	you	think	,	``	 Who 	 a 	 	,	there	's	a	snake	in	there	.	''
But	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 paint 	 ing 	 	.
So	he	 make 	 s 	 	these	 interest 	 ing 	 	 conversation 	 s 	 	about	 real 	 ism 	 	and	mimicry	and	our	drive	to	be	 fool 	 ed 	 	by	great	camouflage	.
The	next	artist	is	Hazel	 Claus 	 en 	 	.
Hazel	 Claus 	 en 	 	is	an	 anthropo 	 logist 	 	who	took	a	sabbatical	and	 decide 	 d 	 	,	``	You	know	,	I	would	learn	a	lot	about	culture	if	I	 create 	 d 	 	a	culture	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	exist	from	scratch	.	''
So	that	's	what	she	did	.
She	 create 	 d 	 	the	Swiss	people	named	the	 Uvul 	 ites 	 	,	and	they	have	 th 	 is 	 	 distinct 	 ive 	 	 yo 	 del 	 ing 	 	song	that	they	use	the	uvula	for	.
And	 al 	 so 	 	they	 re 	 ference 	 	how	the	uvula	--	 every 	 thing 	 	they	say	is	 fall 	 en 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 forbid 	 den 	 	fruit	.
And	that	's	the	symbol	of	 the 	 ir 	 	culture	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	from	a	 document 	 ary 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	``	Sexual	 Practice 	 s 	 	and	 Popul 	 ations 	 	Control	Among	the	 Uvul 	 ites 	 	.	''
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	typical	 ang 	 ora 	 	 embr 	 oid 	 ery 	 	for	them	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 founder 	 s 	 	,	 Ger 	 t 	 	 Schae 	 ffer 	 	.
And	 actual 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	 Au 	 nt 	 	 I 	 rene 	 	.
It	was	so	funny	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	fake	person	who	was	making	fake	 thing 	 s 	 	.
And	I	crack	up	at	 th 	 is 	 	piece	,	 be 	 cause 	 	when	I	see	it	I	know	that	's	French	 ang 	 ora 	 	and	all	 anti 	 que 	 	German	 ribbon 	 s 	 	and	wool	that	I	got	in	a	Nebraska	mill	and	carried	around	for	10	 year 	 s 	 	and	then	 anti 	 que 	 	 Chi 	 nese 	 	 skirt 	 s 	 	.
The	next	is	a	 collect 	 ive 	 	of	 artist 	 s 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	Silver	 Do 	 ber 	 man 	 s 	 	,	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 mot 	 to 	 	is	to	spread	 pragmat 	 ism 	 	one	person	at	a	time	.
And	they	're	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	how	 over 	 - 	 coddled 	 	we	've	 be 	 come 	 	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 comment 	 s 	 	on	how	 over 	 - 	 coddled 	 	we	've	 be 	 come 	 	.
And	what	they	've	 d 	 one 	 	is	they	put	a	 war 	 ning 	 	sign	on	every	single	barb	on	 th 	 is 	 	 f 	 ence 	 	.

 Ro 	 bert 	 	Lang	 fold 	 s 	 	 way 	 - 	 new 	 	origami
My	talk	is	``	 F 	 lap 	 ping 	 	 Bird 	 s 	 	and	Space	 Tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	.	''
And	you	would	think	that	should	have	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	one	 an 	 other 	 	,	but	I	hope	by	the	end	of	these	18	 minute 	 s 	 	,	you	'll	see	a	little	bit	of	a	relation	.
It	ties	to	origami	.	So	let	me	start	.
What	is	origami	?
 Mo 	 st 	 	people	think	they	know	what	origami	is	.	It	's	 th 	 is 	 	:	flapping	 bird 	 s 	 	,	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	,	cootie	 catch 	 ers 	 	,	that	sort	of	thing	.
And	that	is	what	origami	used	to	be	.
But	it	's	 be 	 come 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
It	's	 be 	 come 	 	an	art	form	,	a	form	of	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	.
The	common	theme	--	what	 make 	 s 	 	it	origami	--	is	 fold 	 ing 	 	is	how	we	create	the	form	.
You	know	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	old	.	 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	plate	from	1797	.
It	 show 	 s 	 	these	women	 play 	 ing 	 	with	these	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	.
If	you	look	close	,	it	's	 th 	 is 	 	shape	,	 call 	 ed 	 	a	 cr 	 ane 	 	.
Every	 Japan 	 ese 	 	kid	 learn 	 s 	 	how	to	fold	that	 cr 	 ane 	 	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	art	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	around	for	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	you	would	think	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	around	that	long	--	so	 restrict 	 ive 	 	,	 fold 	 ing 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	--	 every 	 thing 	 	that	could	be	 d 	 one 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 d 	 one 	 	a	long	time	ago	.
And	that	might	have	 be 	 en 	 	the	case	.
But	in	the	 t 	 went 	 ieth 	 	century	,	a	 Japan 	 ese 	 	 fold 	 er 	 	named	 Yo 	 shizawa 	 	came	 a 	 long 	 	,	and	he	 create 	 d 	 	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	new	 design 	 s 	 	.
But	even	more	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	he	 create 	 d 	 	a	language	,	a	way	we	could	communicate	,	a	code	of	 dot 	 s 	 	,	 d 	 ashes 	 	and	 arrow 	 s 	 	.
 Har 	 ken 	 ing 	 	back	to	Susan	 Black 	 more 	 	's	talk	,	we	now	have	a	 mean 	 s 	 	of	 transmit 	 ting 	 	information	with	 her 	 ed 	 ity 	 	and	 s 	 election 	 	,	and	we	know	where	that	 lead 	 s 	 	.
And	where	it	 ha 	 s 	 	led	in	origami	is	to	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	an	origami	figure	--	one	sheet	,	no	 cut 	 s 	 	,	 fold 	 ing 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	,	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 fold 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	,	too	,	is	origami	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 show 	 s 	 	where	we	've	gone	in	the	modern	world	.
 Natural 	 ism 	 	.	 De 	 tail 	 	.
You	can	get	 horn 	 s 	 	,	 ant 	 ler 	 s 	 	--	even	,	if	you	look	close	,	 cl 	 oven 	 	 hoo 	 ves 	 	.
And	it	 raise 	 s 	 	a	question	:	what	 change 	 d 	 	?
And	what	 change 	 d 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	you	might	not	have	 expect 	 ed 	 	in	an	art	,	which	is	math	.
That	is	,	people	 appli 	 ed 	 	 mathematic 	 al 	 	 principle 	 s 	 	to	the	art	,	to	discover	the	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	 law 	 s 	 	.
And	that	 lead 	 s 	 	to	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	tool	.
The	secret	to	 product 	 ivity 	 	in	so	 man 	 y 	 	 field 	 s 	 	--	and	in	origami	--	is	 lett 	 ing 	 	dead	people	do	your	work	for	you	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	what	you	can	do	is	take	your	problem	,	and	turn	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	problem	that	 some 	 one 	 	else	 ha 	 s 	 	 solve 	 d 	 	,	and	use	 the 	 ir 	 	 solution 	 s 	 	.
And	I	want	to	tell	you	how	we	did	that	in	origami	.
 O 	 rigami 	 	 r 	 evolve 	 s 	 	around	crease	 pattern 	 s 	 	.
The	crease	pattern	 show 	 n 	 	here	is	the	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	 blue 	 print 	 	for	an	origami	figure	.
And	you	ca	n't	just	draw	them	 arbitr 	 arily 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	have	to	obey	four	simple	 law 	 s 	 	.
And	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	,	easy	to	understand	.
The	first	law	is	 two 	 - 	 color 	 ability 	 	.	You	can	color	any	crease	pattern	with	just	two	 color 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	ever	 hav 	 ing 	 	the	same	color	 meet 	 ing 	 	.
The	 direction 	 s 	 	of	the	 fold 	 s 	 	at	any	 vert 	 ex 	 	--	the	number	of	mountain	 fold 	 s 	 	,	the	number	of	 val 	 ley 	 	 fold 	 s 	 	--	 al 	 ways 	 	 differ 	 s 	 	by	two	.	Two	more	or	two	less	.
 No 	 thing 	 	else	.
If	you	look	at	the	 angle 	 s 	 	around	the	fold	,	you	find	that	if	you	number	the	 angle 	 s 	 	in	a	circle	,	all	the	 even 	 - 	 number 	 ed 	 	 angle 	 s 	 	add	up	to	a	straight	line	,	all	the	 odd 	 - 	 number 	 ed 	 	 angle 	 s 	 	add	up	to	a	straight	line	.
And	if	you	look	at	how	the	 layer 	 s 	 	stack	,	you	'll	find	that	no	matter	how	you	stack	 fold 	 s 	 	and	 sheet 	 s 	 	,	a	sheet	can	never	penetrate	a	fold	.
So	that	's	four	simple	 law 	 s 	 	.	That	's	all	you	need	in	origami	.
All	of	origami	 come 	 s 	 	from	that	.
And	you	'd	think	,	``	Can	four	simple	 law 	 s 	 	give	rise	to	that	kind	of	 complex 	 ity 	 	?	''
But	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	the	 law 	 s 	 	of	 quant 	 um 	 	 mechanic 	 s 	 	can	be	written	down	on	a	napkin	,	and	yet	they	govern	all	of	 chemist 	 ry 	 	,	all	of	life	,	all	of	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
If	we	obey	these	 law 	 s 	 	,	we	can	do	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
So	in	origami	,	to	obey	these	 law 	 s 	 	,	we	can	take	simple	 pattern 	 s 	 	--	like	 th 	 is 	 	 repeat 	 ing 	 	pattern	of	 fold 	 s 	 	,	 call 	 ed 	 	 text 	 ures 	 	--	and	by	 it 	 self 	 	it	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
But	if	we	follow	the	 law 	 s 	 	of	origami	,	we	can	put	these	 pattern 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 an 	 other 	 	fold	that	 it 	 self 	 	might	be	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	,	but	when	we	put	it	together	,	we	get	 some 	 thing 	 	a	little	different	.
 Th 	 is 	 	fish	,	400	 scale 	 s 	 	--	 aga 	 in 	 	,	it	is	one	 un 	 cut 	 	square	,	 on 	 ly 	 	 fold 	 ing 	 	.
And	if	you	do	n't	want	to	fold	400	 scale 	 s 	 	,	you	can	back	off	and	just	do	a	few	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	add	 plate 	 s 	 	to	the	back	of	a	turtle	,	or	 to 	 es 	 	.
Or	you	can	ramp	up	and	go	up	to	50	 star 	 s 	 	on	a	flag	,	with	13	 strip 	 es 	 	.
And	if	you	want	to	go	 re 	 ally 	 	crazy	,	1,000	 scale 	 s 	 	on	a	 rattle 	 snake 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	guy	's	on	 dis 	 play 	 	 down 	 stair 	 s 	 	,	so	take	a	look	if	you	get	a	chance	.
The	most	 power 	 ful 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	in	origami	have	related	to	how	we	get	 part 	 s 	 	of	 creature 	 s 	 	.
And	I	can	put	it	in	 th 	 is 	 	simple	 equ 	 ation 	 	.
We	take	an	idea	,	combine	it	with	a	square	,	and	you	get	an	origami	figure	.
What	 matter 	 s 	 	is	what	we	mean	by	 t 	 hose 	 	 symbol 	 s 	 	.
And	you	might	say	,	``	Can	you	 re 	 ally 	 	be	that	specific	?
I	mean	,	a	stag	beetle	--	it	's	got	two	 point 	 s 	 	for	 jaw 	 s 	 	,	it	's	got	 antenna 	 e 	 	.	Can	you	be	that	specific	in	the	detail	?	''
And	 yea 	 h 	 	,	you	 re 	 ally 	 	can	.
So	how	do	we	do	that	?	Well	,	we	break	it	down	 in 	 to 	 	a	few	 small 	 er 	 	 step 	 s 	 	.
So	let	me	stretch	out	that	 equ 	 ation 	 	.
I	start	with	my	idea	.	I	abstract	it	.
What	's	the	most	abstract	form	?	It	's	a	stick	figure	.
And	from	that	stick	figure	,	I	 some 	 how 	 	have	to	get	to	a	 fold 	 ed 	 	shape	that	 ha 	 s 	 	a	part	for	every	bit	of	the	subject	,	a	flap	for	every	leg	.
And	then	once	I	have	that	 fold 	 ed 	 	shape	that	we	call	the	base	,	you	can	make	the	 leg 	 s 	 	 narrow 	 er 	 	,	you	can	bend	them	,	you	can	turn	it	 in 	 to 	 	the	 finish 	 ed 	 	shape	.
 N 	 ow 	 	the	first	step	,	 pre 	 tty 	 	easy	.
Take	an	idea	,	draw	a	stick	figure	.
The	last	step	is	not	so	hard	,	but	that	middle	step	--	going	from	the	abstract	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	to	the	 fold 	 ed 	 	shape	--	that	's	hard	.
But	that	's	the	place	where	the	 mathematic 	 al 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	can	get	us	over	the	hump	.
And	I	'm	going	to	show	you	all	how	to	do	that	so	you	can	go	out	of	here	and	fold	 some 	 thing 	 	.
But	we	're	going	to	start	small	.
 Th 	 is 	 	base	 ha 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	 flap 	 s 	 	in	it	.
We	're	going	to	learn	how	to	make	one	flap	.
How	would	you	make	a	single	flap	?
Take	a	square	.	Fold	it	in	half	,	fold	it	in	half	,	fold	it	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 un 	 til 	 	it	 get 	 s 	 	long	and	narrow	,	and	then	we	'll	say	at	the	end	of	that	,	that	's	a	flap	.
I	could	use	that	for	a	leg	,	an	arm	,	 any 	 thing 	 	like	that	.
What	paper	went	 in 	 to 	 	that	flap	?
Well	,	if	I	 un 	 fold 	 	it	and	go	back	to	the	crease	pattern	,	you	can	see	that	the	upper	left	corner	of	that	shape	is	the	paper	that	went	 in 	 to 	 	the	flap	.
So	that	's	the	flap	,	and	all	the	rest	of	the	paper	's	left	over	.
I	can	use	it	for	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
Well	,	there	are	other	ways	of	making	a	flap	.
There	are	other	 dimension 	 s 	 	for	 flap 	 s 	 	.
If	I	make	the	 flap 	 s 	 	 skin 	 ni 	 er 	 	,	I	can	use	a	bit	less	paper	.
If	I	make	the	flap	 a 	 s 	 	 skin 	 ny 	 	 a 	 s 	 	possible	,	I	get	to	the	limit	of	the	 minim 	 um 	 	amount	of	paper	 need 	 ed 	 	.
And	you	can	see	there	,	it	 need 	 s 	 	a	 quarter 	 - 	 circle 	 	of	paper	to	make	a	flap	.
There	's	other	ways	of	making	 flap 	 s 	 	.
If	I	put	the	flap	on	the	edge	,	it	uses	a	half	circle	of	paper	.
And	if	I	make	the	flap	from	the	middle	,	it	uses	a	full	circle	.
So	,	no	matter	how	I	make	a	flap	,	it	 need 	 s 	 	some	part	of	a	 circul 	 ar 	 	region	of	paper	.
So	now	we	're	ready	to	scale	up	.
What	if	I	want	to	make	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	 flap 	 s 	 	?
What	do	I	need	?	I	need	a	lot	of	 circle 	 s 	 	.
And	in	the	1990s	,	origami	 artist 	 s 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	these	 principle 	 s 	 	and	 real 	 ized 	 	we	could	make	 arbitr 	 arily 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	 figure 	 s 	 	just	by	 pack 	 ing 	 	 circle 	 s 	 	.
And	here	's	where	the	dead	people	start	to	help	us	out	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	people	have	 stud 	 ied 	 	the	problem	of	 pack 	 ing 	 	 circle 	 s 	 	.
I	can	 re 	 ly 	 	on	that	vast	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 mathematic 	 ians 	 	and	 artist 	 s 	 	looking	at	 dis 	 c 	 	 pack 	 ing 	 s 	 	and	 arrange 	 ments 	 	.
And	I	can	use	 t 	 hose 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	now	to	create	origami	 shape 	 s 	 	.
So	we	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	these	 rule 	 s 	 	 where 	 by 	 	you	pack	 circle 	 s 	 	,	you	 decor 	 ate 	 	the	 pattern 	 s 	 	of	 circle 	 s 	 	with	lines	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	more	 rule 	 s 	 	.	That	 give 	 s 	 	you	the	 fold 	 s 	 	.
 T 	 hose 	 	 fold 	 s 	 	fold	 in 	 to 	 	a	base	.	You	shape	the	base	.
You	get	a	 fold 	 ed 	 	shape	--	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	a	 cock 	 roach 	 	.
And	it	's	so	simple	.
It	's	so	simple	that	a	computer	could	do	it	.
And	you	say	,	``	Well	,	you	know	,	how	simple	is	that	?	''
But	 computer 	 s 	 	--	you	need	to	be	able	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	in	 ver 	 y 	 	 bas 	 ic 	 	 term 	 s 	 	,	and	with	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	could	.
So	I	wrote	a	computer	program	a	bunch	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	 call 	 ed 	 	 Tree 	 Maker 	 	,	and	you	can	download	it	from	my	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	.
It	's	free	.	It	 run 	 s 	 	on	all	the	major	 platform 	 s 	 	--	even	 Wind 	 ow 	 s 	 	.
And	you	just	draw	a	stick	figure	,	and	it	 calcul 	 ates 	 	the	crease	pattern	.
It	 do 	 es 	 	the	circle	 pack 	 ing 	 	,	 calcul 	 ates 	 	the	crease	pattern	,	and	if	you	use	that	stick	figure	that	I	just	 show 	 ed 	 	--	which	you	can	kind	of	tell	,	it	's	a	 de 	 er 	 	,	it	's	got	 ant 	 ler 	 s 	 	--	you	'll	get	 th 	 is 	 	crease	pattern	.
And	if	you	take	 th 	 is 	 	crease	pattern	,	you	fold	on	the	 dot 	 ted 	 	lines	,	you	'll	get	a	base	that	you	can	then	shape	 in 	 to 	 	a	 de 	 er 	 	,	with	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	crease	pattern	that	you	 want 	 ed 	 	.
And	if	you	want	a	different	 de 	 er 	 	,	not	a	 white 	 - 	 tail 	 ed 	 	 de 	 er 	 	,	but	you	want	a	mule	 de 	 er 	 	,	or	an	 el 	 k 	 	,	you	change	the	 pack 	 ing 	 	,	and	you	can	do	an	 el 	 k 	 	.
Or	you	could	do	a	 mo 	 ose 	 	.
Or	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	any	other	kind	of	 de 	 er 	 	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	 revolution 	 ized 	 	 th 	 is 	 	art	.
We	found	we	could	do	 insect 	 s 	 	,	 spider 	 s 	 	,	which	are	close	,	 thing 	 s 	 	with	 leg 	 s 	 	,	 thing 	 s 	 	with	 leg 	 s 	 	and	 wing 	 s 	 	,	 thing 	 s 	 	with	 leg 	 s 	 	and	 antenna 	 e 	 	.
And	if	 fold 	 ing 	 	a	single	 pray 	 ing 	 	mantis	from	a	single	 un 	 cut 	 	square	was	n't	 interest 	 ing 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	then	you	could	do	two	 pray 	 ing 	 	 mantis 	 es 	 	from	a	single	 un 	 cut 	 	square	.
She	's	eating	him	.
I	call	it	``	 Sn 	 ack 	 	Time	.	''
And	you	can	do	more	than	just	 insect 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	--	you	can	put	 detail 	 s 	 	,	 to 	 es 	 	and	 claw 	 s 	 	.	A	 grizz 	 ly 	 	bear	 ha 	 s 	 	 claw 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	tree	frog	 ha 	 s 	 	 to 	 es 	 	.
 Actu 	 ally 	 	,	 lot 	 s 	 	of	people	in	origami	now	put	 to 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 model 	 s 	 	.
 To 	 es 	 	have	 be 	 come 	 	an	origami	meme	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 every 	 one 	 	's	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
You	can	make	 multi 	 ple 	 	 subject 	 s 	 	.
So	these	are	a	couple	of	 instrument 	 alist 	 s 	 	.
The	guitar	player	from	a	single	square	,	the	 bas 	 s 	 	player	from	a	single	square	.
And	if	you	say	,	``	Well	,	but	the	guitar	,	 bas 	 s 	 	--	that	's	not	so	hot	.
Do	a	little	more	 complic 	 ated 	 	instrument	.	''
Well	,	then	you	could	do	an	organ	.
And	what	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 allow 	 ed 	 	is	the	creation	of	 origami 	 - 	 on 	 - 	 demand 	 	.
So	now	people	can	say	,	``	I	want	 exact 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	and	 th 	 is 	 	and	 th 	 is 	 	,	''	and	you	can	go	out	and	fold	it	.
And	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	you	create	high	art	,	and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	you	pay	the	 bill 	 s 	 	by	 do 	 ing 	 	some	commercial	work	.
But	I	want	to	show	you	some	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
 Every 	 thing 	 	you	'll	see	here	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	the	car	,	is	origami	.
Just	to	show	you	,	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	was	 fold 	 ed 	 	paper	.
 Compu 	 ter 	 s 	 	made	 thing 	 s 	 	move	,	but	these	 we 	 re 	 	all	real	,	 fold 	 ed 	 	 object 	 s 	 	that	we	made	.
And	we	can	use	 th 	 is 	 	not	just	for	 visual 	 s 	 	,	but	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	be	 use 	 ful 	 	even	in	the	real	world	.
 Surpris 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	origami	and	the	 structure 	 s 	 	that	we	've	 develop 	 ed 	 	in	origami	turn	out	to	have	 application 	 s 	 	in	medicine	,	in	science	,	in	space	,	in	the	body	,	consumer	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	and	more	.
And	I	want	to	show	you	some	of	these	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
One	of	the	 ear 	 liest 	 	was	 th 	 is 	 	pattern	,	 th 	 is 	 	 fold 	 ed 	 	pattern	,	 stud 	 ied 	 	by	Koryo	 Mi 	 ura 	 	,	a	 Japan 	 ese 	 	engineer	.
He	 stud 	 ied 	 	a	 fold 	 ing 	 	pattern	,	and	 real 	 ized 	 	 th 	 is 	 	could	fold	down	 in 	 to 	 	an	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	compact	package	that	had	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 open 	 ing 	 	and	 clo 	 s 	 ing 	 	structure	.
And	he	used	it	to	design	 th 	 is 	 	solar	array	.
It	's	an	artist	's	 rend 	 ition 	 	,	but	it	flew	in	a	 Japan 	 ese 	 	 tele 	 scope 	 	in	1995	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	there	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	little	origami	in	the	 Jam 	 es 	 	 Web 	 b 	 	Space	 Tele 	 scope 	 	,	but	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	.
The	 tele 	 scope 	 	,	going	up	in	space	,	it	 un 	 fold 	 s 	 	in	two	 place 	 s 	 	.
It	 fold 	 s 	 	in	 third 	 s 	 	.	It	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	pattern	--	you	would	n't	even	call	that	origami	.
 The 	 y 	 	 certain 	 ly 	 	did	n't	need	to	talk	to	origami	 artist 	 s 	 	.
But	if	you	want	to	go	 high 	 er 	 	and	go	 large 	 r 	 	than	 th 	 is 	 	,	then	you	might	need	some	origami	.
 Engineer 	 s 	 	at	 Law 	 rence 	 	 Liver 	 more 	 	National	Lab	had	an	idea	for	a	 tele 	 scope 	 	much	 large 	 r 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	it	the	 Eye 	 glass 	 	.
The	design	 call 	 ed 	 	for	 geo 	 synchron 	 ous 	 	orbit	25,000	 mile 	 s 	 	up	,	100-meter	 dia 	 meter 	 	lens	.
So	,	imagine	a	lens	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	a	 foot 	 ball 	 	field	.
There	 we 	 re 	 	two	 group 	 s 	 	of	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	:	planetary	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	who	want	to	look	up	,	and	then	other	people	,	who	 want 	 ed 	 	to	look	down	.
 W 	 he 	 ther 	 	you	look	up	or	look	down	,	how	do	you	get	it	up	in	space	?	You	've	got	to	get	it	up	there	in	a	rocket	.
And	 rocket 	 s 	 	are	small	.	So	you	have	to	make	it	 small 	 er 	 	.
How	do	you	make	a	large	sheet	of	glass	 small 	 er 	 	?
Well	,	about	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	is	to	fold	it	up	 some 	 how 	 	.
So	you	have	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	was	a	small	model	.
 Fold 	 ed 	 	lens	,	you	divide	up	the	 pan 	 el 	 s 	 	,	you	add	 flex 	 ures 	 	.
But	 th 	 is 	 	pattern	's	not	going	to	work	to	get	 some 	 thing 	 	100	 meter 	 s 	 	down	to	a	few	 meter 	 s 	 	.
So	the	 Liver 	 more 	 	 engineer 	 s 	 	,	 want 	 ing 	 	to	make	use	of	the	work	of	dead	people	,	or	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	live	 origami 	 st 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Let	's	see	if	 some 	 one 	 	else	is	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	thing	.	''
So	they	 look 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	origami	community	,	we	got	in	touch	with	them	,	and	I	 start 	 ed 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	with	them	.
And	we	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	pattern	together	that	 scale 	 s 	 	to	 arbitr 	 arily 	 	large	 s 	 ize 	 	,	but	that	 allow 	 s 	 	any	flat	ring	or	 dis 	 c 	 	to	fold	down	 in 	 to 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	neat	,	compact	cylinder	.
And	they	 adopt 	 ed 	 	that	for	 the 	 ir 	 	first	generation	,	which	was	not	100	 meter 	 s 	 	--	it	was	a	 five 	 - 	 meter 	 	.
But	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 five 	 - 	 meter 	 	 tele 	 scope 	 	--	 ha 	 s 	 	about	a	 quarter 	 - 	 mile 	 	 f 	 oc 	 al 	 	length	.
And	it	 work 	 s 	 	 perfect 	 ly 	 	on	 it 	 s 	 	test	range	,	and	it	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	 fold 	 s 	 	up	 in 	 to 	 	a	neat	little	 bundl 	 e 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	there	is	other	origami	in	space	.
Japan	 Aero 	 space 	 	[	 Explo 	 ration 	 	]	 Age 	 ncy 	 	flew	a	solar	sail	,	and	you	can	see	here	that	the	sail	 expand 	 s 	 	out	,	and	you	can	still	see	the	fold	lines	.
The	problem	that	's	 be 	 ing 	 	 solve 	 d 	 	here	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	big	and	 sheet 	 - 	 like 	 	at	 it 	 s 	 	destination	,	but	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	small	for	the	journey	.
And	that	 work 	 s 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	you	're	going	 in 	 to 	 	space	,	or	 whet 	 her 	 	you	're	just	going	 in 	 to 	 	a	body	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	is	the	 lat 	 ter 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	heart	 s 	 tent 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	by	Zhong	You	at	Oxford	 Univers 	 ity 	 	.
It	 hold 	 s 	 	open	a	 block 	 ed 	 	 art 	 ery 	 	when	it	 get 	 s 	 	to	 it 	 s 	 	destination	,	but	it	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	much	 small 	 er 	 	for	the	trip	there	,	through	your	blood	 vessel 	 s 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 tent 	 	 fold 	 s 	 	down	using	an	origami	pattern	,	based	on	a	model	 call 	 ed 	 	the	water	bomb	base	.
 Air 	 bag 	 	 design 	 ers 	 	 al 	 so 	 	have	the	problem	of	 get 	 ting 	 	flat	 sheet 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	small	space	.
And	they	want	to	do	 the 	 ir 	 	design	by	 simul 	 ation 	 	.
So	they	need	to	figure	out	how	,	in	a	computer	,	to	flatten	an	airbag	.
And	the	 algorithm 	 s 	 	that	we	 develop 	 ed 	 	to	do	 insect 	 s 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	to	be	the	solution	for	 airbag 	 s 	 	to	do	 the 	 ir 	 	 simul 	 ation 	 	.
And	so	they	can	do	a	 simul 	 ation 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 T 	 hose 	 	are	the	origami	 crease 	 s 	 	 form 	 ing 	 	,	and	now	you	can	see	the	airbag	 infla 	 te 	 	and	find	out	,	 do 	 es 	 	it	work	?
And	that	 lead 	 s 	 	to	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	idea	.
You	know	,	where	did	these	 thing 	 s 	 	come	from	?
Well	,	the	heart	 s 	 tent 	 	came	from	that	little	 blow 	 - 	 up 	 	box	that	you	might	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	in	 element 	 ary 	 	school	.
It	's	the	same	pattern	,	 call 	 ed 	 	the	water	bomb	base	.
The	 airbag 	 - 	 flatten 	 ing 	 	algorithm	came	from	all	the	 develop 	 ments 	 	of	circle	 pack 	 ing 	 	and	the	 mathematic 	 al 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	that	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	just	to	create	 insect 	 s 	 	--	 thing 	 s 	 	with	 leg 	 s 	 	.
The	thing	is	,	that	 th 	 is 	 	often	 happen 	 s 	 	in	math	and	science	.
When	you	get	math	 involve 	 d 	 	,	 problem 	 s 	 	that	you	solve	for	aesthetic	value	 on 	 ly 	 	,	or	to	create	 some 	 thing 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	turn	around	and	turn	out	to	have	an	application	in	the	real	world	.
And	 a 	 s 	 	weird	and	surprising	 a 	 s 	 	it	may	sound	,	origami	may	 some 	 day 	 	even	 s 	 ave 	 	a	life	.
 Thank 	 s 	 	.

It	can	be	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	thing	,	the	ocean	.
And	it	can	be	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	thing	,	what	human	health	is	.
And	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	two	together	might	seem	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 daunt 	 ing 	 	task	,	but	what	I	'm	going	to	try	to	say	is	that	even	in	that	 complex 	 ity 	 	,	there	's	some	simple	 theme 	 s 	 	that	I	think	,	if	we	understand	,	we	can	 re 	 ally 	 	move	forward	.
And	 t 	 hose 	 	simple	 theme 	 s 	 	are	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	 theme 	 s 	 	about	the	complex	science	of	what	's	going	on	,	but	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	all	 pre 	 tty 	 	well	know	.
And	I	'm	going	to	start	with	 th 	 is 	 	one	:	If	 mom 	 ma 	 	ai	n't	happy	,	ai	n't	 no 	 body 	 	happy	.
We	know	that	,	right	?	We	've	 experience 	 d 	 	that	.
And	if	we	just	take	that	and	we	build	from	there	,	then	we	can	go	to	the	next	step	,	which	is	that	if	the	ocean	ai	n't	happy	,	ai	n't	 no 	 body 	 	happy	.
That	's	the	theme	of	my	talk	.
And	we	're	making	the	ocean	 pre 	 tty 	 	 un 	 happy 	 	in	a	lot	of	different	ways	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	shot	of	 Can 	 nery 	 	Row	in	1932	.
 Can 	 nery 	 	Row	,	at	the	time	,	had	the	 big 	 gest 	 	industrial	canning	operation	on	the	west	coast	.
We	 pil 	 ed 	 	enormous	 amount 	 s 	 	of	 poll 	 ution 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	air	and	 in 	 to 	 	the	water	.
 Ro 	 lf 	 	 Bo 	 lin 	 	,	who	was	a	professor	at	the	 Hop 	 kin 	 	's	Marine	 St 	 ation 	 	where	I	work	,	wrote	in	the	1940s	that	``	The	 fum 	 es 	 	from	the	 s 	 cum 	 	 float 	 ing 	 	on	the	 in 	 lets 	 	of	the	 ba 	 y 	 	 we 	 re 	 	so	bad	they	 turn 	 ed 	 	 lead 	 - 	 based 	 	 paint 	 s 	 	black	.

 The 	 y 	 	say	,	``	You	know	what	you	smell	?
You	smell	money	.	''
That	 poll 	 ution 	 	was	money	to	that	community	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	people	 deal 	 t 	 	with	the	 poll 	 ution 	 	and	 absorb 	 ed 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	skin	and	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	bodies	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 need 	 ed 	 	the	money	.
We	made	the	ocean	 un 	 happy 	 	;	we	made	people	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 happy 	 	,	and	we	made	them	 un 	 health 	 y 	 	.
The	 connect 	 ion 	 	between	ocean	health	and	human	health	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	based	 up 	 on 	 	 an 	 other 	 	couple	simple	 ad 	 age 	 s 	 	,	and	I	want	to	call	that	``	pinch	a	 min 	 now 	 	,	hurt	a	whale	.	''

 N 	 ow 	 	,	when	an	ecologist	 look 	 s 	 	at	the	ocean	--	I	have	to	tell	you	--	we	look	at	the	ocean	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	different	way	,	and	we	see	different	 thing 	 s 	 	than	when	a	regular	person	 look 	 s 	 	at	the	ocean	 be 	 cause 	 	when	an	ecologist	 look 	 s 	 	at	the	ocean	,	we	see	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 interconnect 	 ions 	 	.
We	see	the	base	of	the	food	chain	,	the	plankton	,	the	small	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	we	see	how	 t 	 hose 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	are	food	to	 animal 	 s 	 	in	the	middle	of	the	pyramid	,	and	on	so	up	 th 	 is 	 	 dia 	 gram 	 	.
And	that	flow	,	that	flow	of	life	,	from	the	 ver 	 y 	 	base	up	to	the	 ver 	 y 	 	top	,	is	the	flow	that	 ecologist 	 s 	 	see	.
And	that	's	what	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	preserve	when	we	say	,	``	 Sav 	 e 	 	the	ocean	.	 He 	 al 	 	the	ocean	.	''
It	's	that	pyramid	.
 N 	 ow 	 	why	 do 	 es 	 	that	matter	for	human	health	?
 Be 	 cause 	 	when	we	jam	 thing 	 s 	 	in	the	bottom	of	that	pyramid	that	should	n't	be	there	,	some	 ver 	 y 	 	 frighten 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	happen	.
 Poll 	 ut 	 ants 	 	,	some	 pollutant 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 create 	 d 	 	by	us	:	 molecule 	 s 	 	like	 PC 	 B 	 s 	 	that	ca	n't	be	broken	down	by	our	bodies	.
And	they	go	in	the	base	of	that	pyramid	,	and	they	drift	up	;	they	're	 pass 	 ed 	 	up	that	way	,	on	to	 predator 	 s 	 	and	on	to	the	top	 predator 	 s 	 	,	and	in	so	 do 	 ing 	 	,	they	 accumul 	 ate 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	to	 br 	 ing 	 	that	home	,	I	thought	I	'd	invent	a	little	game	.
We	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	have	to	play	it	;	we	can	just	think	about	it	here	.
It	's	the	 Styro 	 foam 	 	and	chocolate	game	.
 Imagin 	 e 	 	that	when	we	got	on	 th 	 is 	 	boat	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	all	 give 	 n 	 	two	 Styro 	 foam 	 	 peanut 	 s 	 	.
Ca	n't	do	much	with	them	:	Put	them	in	your	pocket	.
 Sup 	 pose 	 	the	 rule 	 s 	 	are	:	every	time	you	 off 	 er 	 	 some 	 body 	 	a	drink	,	you	give	them	the	drink	,	and	you	give	them	your	 Styro 	 foam 	 	 peanut 	 s 	 	too	.
What	'll	happen	is	that	the	 Styro 	 foam 	 	 peanut 	 s 	 	will	start	moving	through	our	 socie 	 ty 	 	here	,	and	they	will	 accumul 	 ate 	 	in	the	 drunk 	 est 	 	,	 s 	 ting 	 iest 	 	people	.
There	's	no	 mechan 	 ism 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	game	for	them	to	go	 any 	 where 	 	but	 in 	 to 	 	a	 big 	 ger 	 	and	 big 	 ger 	 	pile	of	 in 	 digest 	 ible 	 	 Styro 	 foam 	 	 peanut 	 s 	 	.
And	that	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	 happen 	 s 	 	with	 PD 	 B 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	food	pyramid	:	 The 	 y 	 	 accumul 	 ate 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	top	of	it	.
 N 	 ow 	 	suppose	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 Styro 	 foam 	 	 peanut 	 s 	 	,	we	take	these	 love 	 ly 	 	little	 chocolate 	 s 	 	that	we	get	and	we	had	 t 	 hose 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	.
Well	,	some	of	us	would	be	eating	 t 	 hose 	 	 chocolate 	 s 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 pass 	 ing 	 	them	around	,	and	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 accumul 	 ating 	 	,	they	will	just	pass	 in 	 to 	 	our	group	here	and	not	 accumul 	 ate 	 	in	any	one	group	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	 absorb 	 ed 	 	by	us	.
And	that	's	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	a	 PC 	 B 	 	and	,	say	,	 some 	 thing 	 	natural	like	an	 o 	 mega 	 - 	 3 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	we	want	out	of	the	marine	food	chain	.
 PC 	 B 	 s 	 	 accumul 	 ate 	 	.
We	have	great	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	that	,	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	.
 PC 	 B 	 s 	 	 accumul 	 ate 	 	in	 dolphin 	 s 	 	in	 Sara 	 s 	 ota 	 	Bay	,	in	Texas	,	in	North	 Caro 	 lina 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	get	 in 	 to 	 	the	food	chain	.
The	 dolphin 	 s 	 	eat	the	fish	that	have	 PC 	 B 	 s 	 	from	the	plankton	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	 PC 	 B 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 ing 	 	 fat 	 - 	 soluble 	 	,	 accumul 	 ate 	 	in	these	 dolphin 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	a	dolphin	,	mother	dolphin	,	any	dolphin	--	there	's	 on 	 ly 	 	one	way	that	a	 PC 	 B 	 	can	get	out	of	a	dolphin	.
And	what	's	that	?
In	mother	's	milk	.
 He 	 re 	 	's	a	 dia 	 gram 	 	of	the	 PC 	 B 	 	load	of	 dolphin 	 s 	 	in	 Sara 	 s 	 ota 	 	Bay	.
Adult	 male 	 s 	 	:	a	huge	load	.
 Ju 	 ve 	 ni 	 les 	 	:	a	huge	load	.
 Fe 	 male 	 s 	 	after	 the 	 ir 	 	first	 ca 	 lf 	 	is	 al 	 ready 	 	 wean 	 ed 	 	:	a	lower	load	.
 T 	 hose 	 	 female 	 s 	 	,	they	're	not	 try 	 ing 	 	to	.
 T 	 hose 	 	 female 	 s 	 	are	 pass 	 ing 	 	the	 PC 	 B 	 s 	 	in	the	fat	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	mother	's	milk	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 off 	 spring 	 	,	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 off 	 spring 	 	do	n't	 surviv 	 e 	 	.
The	death	rate	in	these	 dolphin 	 s 	 	,	for	the	first	 ca 	 lf 	 	born	of	every	female	dolphin	,	is	60	to	80	percent	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	 mother 	 s 	 	pump	 the 	 ir 	 	first	 off 	 spring 	 	full	of	 th 	 is 	 	pollutant	,	and	most	of	them	die	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	the	mother	then	can	go	and	 re 	 produce 	 	,	but	what	a	 terr 	 ible 	 	price	to	pay	for	the	 accumul 	 ation 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	pollutant	in	these	 animal 	 s 	 	--	the	death	of	the	 first 	 - 	 born 	 	 ca 	 lf 	 	.
There	's	 an 	 other 	 	top	predator	in	the	ocean	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	.
That	top	predator	,	of	course	,	is	us	.
And	we	 al 	 so 	 	are	eating	meat	that	 come 	 s 	 	from	some	of	these	same	 place 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	whale	meat	that	I	 photograph 	 ed 	 	in	a	 grocer 	 y 	 	store	in	 To 	 kyo 	 	--	or	is	it	?
In	fact	,	what	we	did	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	was	learn	how	to	smuggle	a	 mole 	 cular 	 	biology	lab	 in 	 to 	 	 To 	 kyo 	 	and	use	it	to	 genetic 	 ally 	 	test	the	DNA	out	of	whale	meat	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	and	identify	what	they	 re 	 ally 	 	 we 	 re 	 	.
And	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	whale	meat	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	whale	meat	.
Some	of	them	 we 	 re 	 	 il 	 legal 	 	whale	meat	,	by	the	way	.
That	's	 an 	 other 	 	story	.
But	some	of	them	 we 	 re 	 	not	whale	meat	at	all	.
Even	 th 	 ough 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 label 	 ed 	 	whale	meat	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	dolphin	meat	.
Some	of	them	 we 	 re 	 	dolphin	liver	.	Some	of	them	 we 	 re 	 	dolphin	 blu 	 b 	 ber 	 	.
And	 t 	 hose 	 	dolphin	 part 	 s 	 	had	a	huge	load	of	 PC 	 B 	 s 	 	,	 dioxin 	 s 	 	and	heavy	 metal 	 s 	 	.
And	that	huge	load	was	 pass 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	people	that	ate	 th 	 is 	 	meat	.
It	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	a	lot	of	 dolphin 	 s 	 	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 s 	 old 	 	 a 	 s 	 	meat	in	the	whale	meat	market	around	the	world	.
That	's	a	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	for	 t 	 hose 	 	 population 	 s 	 	,	but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	for	the	people	eating	them	 be 	 cause 	 	they	do	n't	know	that	that	's	toxic	meat	.
We	had	these	data	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
I	remember	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	at	my	desk	 be 	 ing 	 	about	the	 on 	 ly 	 	person	in	the	world	who	 k 	 new 	 	that	whale	meat	 be 	 ing 	 	 s 	 old 	 	in	these	 market 	 s 	 	was	 re 	 ally 	 	dolphin	meat	,	and	it	was	toxic	.
It	had	 two 	 - 	 to 	 - 	 three 	 - 	 to 	 - 	 400 	 	 time 	 s 	 	the	toxic	 load 	 s 	 	ever	 allow 	 ed 	 	by	the	 E 	 PA 	 	.
And	I	remember	there	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	at	my	desk	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	Well	,	I	know	 th 	 is 	 	.	 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	great	scientific	 discover 	 y 	 	,	''	but	it	was	so	awful	.
And	for	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	time	in	my	scientific	 care 	 er 	 	,	I	broke	scientific	 proto 	 col 	 	,	which	is	that	you	take	the	data	and	publish	them	in	scientific	 journal 	 s 	 	and	then	begin	to	talk	about	them	.
We	 s 	 ent 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	polite	letter	to	the	 Mini 	 ster 	 	of	Health	in	Japan	and	 simpl 	 y 	 	 point 	 ed 	 	out	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 in 	 toler 	 able 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	,	not	for	us	,	but	for	the	people	of	Japan	 be 	 cause 	 	 mother 	 s 	 	who	may	be	 breast 	 feed 	 ing 	 	,	who	may	have	young	children	,	would	be	 buy 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	they	thought	was	 health 	 y 	 	,	but	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	toxic	.
That	led	to	a	whole	 s 	 eries 	 	of	other	 campaign 	 s 	 	in	Japan	,	and	I	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	proud	to	say	that	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	to	buy	 any 	 thing 	 	in	Japan	that	's	 label 	 ed 	 	 in 	 correct 	 ly 	 	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	they	're	still	selling	whale	meat	,	which	I	 believ 	 e 	 	they	should	n't	.
But	at	 l 	 east 	 	it	's	 label 	 ed 	 	 correct 	 ly 	 	,	and	you	're	no	 long 	 er 	 	going	to	be	 buy 	 ing 	 	toxic	dolphin	meat	 in 	 stead 	 	.
It	is	n't	just	there	that	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	,	but	in	a	natural	diet	of	some	 commun 	 ities 	 	in	the	Canadian	 arc 	 tic 	 	and	in	the	 Unit 	 ed 	 	 Stat 	 es 	 	and	in	the	European	 arc 	 tic 	 	,	a	natural	diet	of	 seal 	 s 	 	and	 whale 	 s 	 	 lead 	 s 	 	to	an	 accumul 	 ation 	 	of	 PC 	 B 	 s 	 	that	have	 gather 	 ed 	 	up	from	all	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	world	and	 end 	 ed 	 	up	in	these	women	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	women	have	toxic	breast	milk	.
 The 	 y 	 	can	not	feed	 the 	 ir 	 	 off 	 spring 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	children	,	 the 	 ir 	 	breast	milk	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 accumul 	 ation 	 	of	these	 toxin 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	food	chain	,	in	 the 	 ir 	 	part	of	the	world	's	ocean	pyramid	.
That	 mean 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 immun 	 e 	 	 system 	 s 	 	are	 com 	 promise 	 d 	 	.
It	 mean 	 s 	 	that	 the 	 ir 	 	children	's	 develop 	 ment 	 	can	be	 com 	 promise 	 d 	 	.
And	the	world	's	attention	on	 th 	 is 	 	over	the	last	decade	 ha 	 s 	 	 reduc 	 ed 	 	the	problem	for	these	women	,	not	by	changing	the	pyramid	,	but	by	changing	what	they	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	eat	out	of	it	.
We	've	taken	them	out	of	 the 	 ir 	 	natural	pyramid	in	order	to	solve	 th 	 is 	 	problem	.
That	's	a	good	thing	for	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	 a 	 cute 	 	problem	,	but	it	 do 	 es 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	solve	the	pyramid	problem	.
There	's	other	ways	of	 break 	 ing 	 	the	pyramid	.
The	pyramid	,	if	we	jam	 thing 	 s 	 	in	the	bottom	,	can	get	 back 	 ed 	 	up	like	a	 sew 	 er 	 	line	that	's	 clog 	 ged 	 	.
And	if	we	jam	 nutrient 	 s 	 	,	 sew 	 age 	 	,	 fertil 	 izer 	 	in	the	base	of	that	food	pyramid	,	it	can	back	up	all	through	it	.
We	end	up	with	 thing 	 s 	 	we	've	heard	about	before	:	red	 tide 	 s 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	which	are	 bloom 	 s 	 	of	toxic	 al 	 ga 	 e 	 	 float 	 ing 	 	through	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	 caus 	 ing 	 	 neuro 	 logical 	 	damage	.
We	can	 al 	 so 	 	see	 bloom 	 s 	 	of	bacteria	,	 bloom 	 s 	 	of	viruses	in	the	ocean	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	two	 shot 	 s 	 	of	a	red	tide	coming	on	shore	here	and	a	bacteria	in	the	 gen 	 us 	 	vibrio	,	which	 include 	 s 	 	the	 gen 	 us 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	cholera	in	it	.
How	 man 	 y 	 	people	have	 s 	 een 	 	a	``	beach	closed	''	sign	?
Why	 do 	 es 	 	that	happen	?
It	 happen 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	 jamm 	 ed 	 	so	much	 in 	 to 	 	the	base	of	the	natural	ocean	pyramid	that	these	bacteria	clog	it	up	and	 over 	 fill 	 	onto	our	 beach 	 es 	 	.
 Of 	 ten 	 	what	 jam 	 s 	 	us	up	is	 sew 	 age 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	have	ever	gone	to	a	state	park	or	a	national	park	where	you	had	a	big	sign	at	the	front	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	 C 	 lose 	 d 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	human	 sew 	 age 	 	is	so	far	over	 th 	 is 	 	park	that	you	ca	n't	use	it	''	?
Not	 ver 	 y 	 	often	.	We	would	n't	 toler 	 ate 	 	that	.
We	would	n't	 toler 	 ate 	 	our	 park 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 swamp 	 ed 	 	by	human	 sew 	 age 	 	,	but	 beach 	 es 	 	are	closed	a	lot	in	our	country	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	closed	more	and	more	and	more	all	around	the	world	for	the	same	reason	,	and	I	 believ 	 e 	 	we	should	n't	 toler 	 ate 	 	that	either	.
It	's	not	just	a	question	of	 clean 	 lines 	 s 	 	;	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	question	of	how	 t 	 hose 	 	 organism 	 s 	 	then	turn	 in 	 to 	 	human	disease	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	 vibrio 	 s 	 	,	these	bacteria	,	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	infect	people	.
 The 	 y 	 	can	go	 in 	 to 	 	your	skin	and	create	skin	 infect 	 ions 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	graph	from	 NO 	 AA 	 	's	ocean	and	human	health	 initi 	 ative 	 	,	 show 	 ing 	 	the	rise	of	the	 infect 	 ions 	 	by	vibrio	in	people	over	the	last	few	 year 	 s 	 	.
 Sur 	 fer 	 s 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	know	 th 	 is 	 	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	.
And	if	you	can	see	on	some	surfing	 s 	 ites 	 	,	in	fact	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	do	you	see	what	the	 wave 	 s 	 	are	like	or	what	the	weather	's	like	,	but	on	some	surf	rider	 s 	 ites 	 	,	you	see	a	little	 flash 	 ing 	 	poo	alert	.
That	 mean 	 s 	 	that	the	beach	might	have	great	 wave 	 s 	 	,	but	it	's	a	 danger 	 ous 	 	place	for	 surf 	 ers 	 	to	be	 be 	 cause 	 	they	can	carry	with	them	,	even	after	a	great	day	of	surfing	,	 th 	 is 	 	 leg 	 acy 	 	of	an	 infect 	 ion 	 	that	might	take	a	 ver 	 y 	 	long	time	to	solve	.
Some	of	these	 infect 	 ions 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 carry 	 ing 	 	 anti 	 biotic 	 	 resist 	 ance 	 	 gene 	 s 	 	now	,	and	that	 make 	 s 	 	them	even	more	difficult	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	same	 infect 	 ions 	 	create	 harm 	 ful 	 	 al 	 gal 	 	 bloom 	 s 	 	.
 T 	 hose 	 	 bloom 	 s 	 	are	generating	other	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 chemical 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	just	a	simple	list	of	some	of	the	 type 	 s 	 	of	 poison 	 s 	 	that	come	out	of	these	 harm 	 ful 	 	 al 	 gal 	 	 bloom 	 s 	 	:	 shell 	 fish 	 	 poison 	 ing 	 	,	fish	 ci 	 gua 	 tera 	 	,	diarrheic	 shell 	 fish 	 	 poison 	 ing 	 	--	you	do	n't	want	to	know	about	that	--	 neuro 	 toxic 	 	 shell 	 fish 	 	 poison 	 ing 	 	,	 para 	 ly 	 tic 	 	 shell 	 fish 	 	 poison 	 ing 	 	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 get 	 ting 	 	 in 	 to 	 	our	food	chain	 be 	 cause 	 	of	these	 bloom 	 s 	 	.

 Cope 	 pods 	 	are	small	 crustacean 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	a	 tin 	 y 	 	fraction	of	an	inch	long	,	and	they	can	carry	on	 the 	 ir 	 	little	 leg 	 s 	 	some	of	the	cholera	bacteria	that	then	 lead 	 s 	 	to	human	disease	.

So	what	do	you	do	?
We	have	major	 problem 	 s 	 	in	 disrupt 	 ed 	 	 eco 	 system 	 	flow	that	the	pyramid	may	not	be	 work 	 ing 	 	so	well	,	that	the	flow	from	the	base	up	 in 	 to 	 	it	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 block 	 ed 	 	and	 clog 	 ged 	 	.
What	do	you	do	when	you	have	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	 disrupt 	 ed 	 	flow	?
Well	,	there	's	a	bunch	of	 thing 	 s 	 	you	could	do	.
You	could	call	 Jo 	 e 	 	the	 P 	 lumber 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
And	he	could	come	in	and	fix	the	flow	.
But	in	fact	,	if	you	look	around	the	world	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	are	there	hope	 spot 	 s 	 	for	where	we	may	be	able	to	fix	 problem 	 s 	 	,	there	have	 be 	 en 	 	 place 	 s 	 	where	 problem 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 fix 	 ed 	 	,	where	people	have	come	to	 grip 	 s 	 	with	these	 issue 	 s 	 	and	 beg 	 un 	 	to	turn	them	around	.

I	 start 	 ed 	 	out	 show 	 ing 	 	how	much	we	had	 di 	 stress 	 ed 	 	the	 Monte 	 re 	 y 	 	Bay	 eco 	 system 	 	with	 poll 	 ution 	 	and	the	canning	industry	and	all	of	the	 attend 	 ant 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	.
In	1932	,	that	's	the	picture	.
In	2009	,	the	picture	is	 dramat 	 ically 	 	different	.
The	 can 	 n 	 eries 	 	are	gone	.	The	 poll 	 ution 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 ab 	 ated 	 	.
But	there	's	a	 great 	 er 	 	sense	here	that	what	the	individual	 commun 	 ities 	 	need	is	 work 	 ing 	 	 eco 	 system 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	need	a	 function 	 ing 	 	pyramid	from	the	base	all	the	way	to	the	top	.
And	that	pyramid	in	 Monte 	 re 	 y 	 	,	right	now	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 effort 	 s 	 	of	a	lot	of	different	people	,	is	 function 	 ing 	 	better	than	it	's	ever	 function 	 ed 	 	for	the	last	150	 year 	 s 	 	.
It	did	n't	happen	 accident 	 ally 	 	.
It	 happen 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 man 	 y 	 	people	put	 the 	 ir 	 	time	and	effort	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 pioneer 	 ing 	 	spirit	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
On	the	left	there	,	Julia	Platt	,	the	mayor	of	my	little	 home 	 town 	 	in	Pacific	Grove	.
At	74	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	 be 	 came 	 	mayor	 be 	 cause 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	had	to	be	 d 	 one 	 	to	protect	the	ocean	.
In	1931	,	she	 produce 	 d 	 	California	's	first	 community 	 - 	 based 	 	marine	 protect 	 ed 	 	area	,	right	next	to	the	 big 	 gest 	 	polluting	 can 	 nery 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	Julia	 k 	 new 	 	that	when	the	 can 	 n 	 eries 	 	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	 we 	 re 	 	gone	,	the	ocean	 need 	 ed 	 	a	place	to	grow	from	,	that	the	ocean	 need 	 ed 	 	a	place	to	spark	a	seed	,	and	she	 want 	 ed 	 	to	provide	that	seed	.
Other	people	,	like	 D 	 avid 	 	 Pack 	 ard 	 	and	 Ju 	 lie 	 	 Pack 	 ard 	 	,	who	 we 	 re 	 	 instrument 	 al 	 	in	producing	the	 Monte 	 re 	 y 	 	Bay	 aqua 	 rium 	 	to	lock	 in 	 to 	 	people	's	 not 	 ion 	 	that	the	ocean	and	the	health	of	the	ocean	 eco 	 system 	 	 we 	 re 	 	just	 a 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	area	 a 	 s 	 	eating	the	 eco 	 system 	 	would	be	.
That	change	in	 think 	 ing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	led	to	a	 dramat 	 ic 	 	shift	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	in	the	 fortune 	 s 	 	of	 Monte 	 re 	 y 	 	Bay	,	but	other	 place 	 s 	 	around	the	world	.
Well	,	I	want	to	 leav 	 e 	 	you	with	the	thought	that	what	we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	here	is	protect	 th 	 is 	 	ocean	pyramid	,	and	that	ocean	pyramid	 connect 	 s 	 	to	our	own	pyramid	of	life	.
It	's	an	ocean	planet	,	and	we	think	of	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	terrestrial	species	,	but	the	pyramid	of	life	in	the	ocean	and	our	own	 live 	 s 	 	on	land	are	 intric 	 ate 	 ly 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	.
And	it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	through	 hav 	 ing 	 	the	ocean	 be 	 ing 	 	 health 	 y 	 	that	we	can	remain	 health 	 y 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.

 J 	 essa 	 	 Gam 	 ble 	 	:	Our	natural	sleep	cycle
Let	's	start	with	day	and	night	.
Life	 evolv 	 ed 	 	under	 condition 	 s 	 	of	light	and	 dark 	 ness 	 	,	light	and	then	 dark 	 ness 	 	.
And	so	 plant 	 s 	 	and	 animal 	 s 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	internal	 clock 	 s 	 	so	that	they	would	be	ready	for	these	 change 	 s 	 	in	light	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	chemical	 clock 	 s 	 	,	and	they	're	found	in	every	known	 be 	 ing 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	two	or	more	 cell 	 s 	 	and	in	some	that	 on 	 ly 	 	have	one	cell	.
I	'll	give	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	--	if	you	take	a	 horse 	 shoe 	 	crab	off	the	beach	,	and	you	fly	it	all	the	way	 a 	 cross 	 	the	continent	,	and	you	drop	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	 slop 	 ed 	 	cage	,	it	will	scramble	up	the	floor	of	the	cage	 a 	 s 	 	the	tide	is	 ris 	 ing 	 	on	 it 	 s 	 	home	 shore 	 s 	 	,	and	it	'll	 s 	 kit 	 ter 	 	down	 aga 	 in 	 	right	 a 	 s 	 	the	water	is	 reced 	 ing 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 mile 	 s 	 	away	.
It	'll	do	 th 	 is 	 	for	 week 	 s 	 	,	 un 	 til 	 	it	kind	of	 gradu 	 ally 	 	 lose 	 s 	 	the	plot	.
And	it	's	 in 	 credible 	 	to	watch	,	but	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	 psych 	 ic 	 	or	 para 	 normal 	 	going	on	;	it	's	 simpl 	 y 	 	that	these	 crab 	 s 	 	have	internal	 cycle 	 s 	 	that	correspond	,	 usual 	 ly 	 	,	with	what	's	going	on	around	it	.
So	,	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	ability	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
And	in	 human 	 s 	 	,	we	call	it	the	``	body	clock	.	''
You	can	see	 th 	 is 	 	most	 clear 	 ly 	 	when	you	take	away	 some 	 one 	 	's	watch	and	you	shut	them	 in 	 to 	 	a	 bunk 	 er 	 	,	deep	 under 	 ground 	 	,	for	a	couple	of	 month 	 s 	 	.
People	 actual 	 ly 	 	volunteer	for	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	they	 usual 	 ly 	 	come	out	kind	of	 r 	 av 	 ing 	 	about	 the 	 ir 	 	productive	time	in	the	hole	.
So	,	no	matter	how	 a 	 typical 	 	these	 subject 	 s 	 	would	have	to	be	,	they	all	show	the	same	thing	.
 The 	 y 	 	get	up	just	a	little	bit	 lat 	 er 	 	every	day	--	say	15	 minute 	 s 	 	or	so	--	and	they	kind	of	drift	all	the	way	around	the	clock	like	 th 	 is 	 	over	the	course	of	the	 week 	 s 	 	.
And	so	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	we	know	that	they	are	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	internal	 clock 	 s 	 	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 some 	 how 	 	 sens 	 ing 	 	the	day	 out 	 side 	 	.
So	fine	,	we	have	a	body	clock	,	and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	it	's	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	in	our	 live 	 s 	 	.
It	's	a	huge	driver	for	culture	and	I	think	that	it	's	the	most	 under 	 rated 	 	force	on	our	behavior	.
We	 evolv 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	species	near	the	 equ 	 ator 	 	,	and	so	we	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 well 	 - 	 equi 	 pped 	 	to	deal	with	12	 hour 	 s 	 	of	 day 	 light 	 	and	12	 hour 	 s 	 	of	 dark 	 ness 	 	.
But	of	course	,	we	've	spread	to	every	corner	of	the	 glob 	 e 	 	and	in	 Arc 	 tic 	 	Canada	,	where	I	live	,	we	have	 perpetu 	 al 	 	 day 	 light 	 	in	summer	and	24	 hour 	 s 	 	of	 dark 	 ness 	 	in	winter	.
So	the	culture	,	the	 north 	 ern 	 	 ab 	 original 	 	culture	,	 tradition 	 ally 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 high 	 ly 	 	 season 	 al 	 	.
In	winter	,	there	's	a	lot	of	 sleep 	 ing 	 	going	on	;	you	enjoy	your	family	life	 in 	 side 	 	.
And	in	summer	,	it	's	 al 	 most 	 	 man 	 ic 	 	 hunt 	 ing 	 	and	 work 	 ing 	 	activity	 ver 	 y 	 	long	 hour 	 s 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	active	.
So	,	what	would	our	natural	rhythm	look	like	?
What	would	our	 sleep 	 ing 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	be	in	the	sort	of	ideal	sense	?
Well	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	when	people	are	living	 with 	 out 	 	any	sort	of	artificial	light	at	all	,	they	sleep	twice	every	night	.
 The 	 y 	 	go	to	bed	around	8:00	p.m	.
 un 	 til 	 	 mid 	 night 	 	and	then	 aga 	 in 	 	,	they	sleep	from	about	2:00	 a.m 	 . 	 	 un 	 til 	 	 s 	 un 	 rise 	 	.
And	 in 	 - 	 between 	 	,	they	have	a	couple	of	 hour 	 s 	 	of	sort	of	 medit 	 ative 	 	quiet	in	bed	.
And	 dur 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	time	,	there	's	a	 s 	 urge 	 	of	 pro 	 lac 	 tin 	 	,	the	 like 	 s 	 	of	which	a	modern	day	never	 s 	 ees 	 	.
The	people	in	these	 stud 	 ies 	 	report	 feel 	 ing 	 	so	awake	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	 day 	 time 	 	,	that	they	 real 	 ize 	 	they	're	 ex 	 peri 	 encing 	 	true	 wake 	 fulness 	 	for	the	first	time	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
So	,	cut	to	the	modern	day	.
We	're	living	in	a	culture	of	jet	lag	,	global	travel	,	24-hour	business	,	shift	work	.
And	you	know	,	our	modern	ways	of	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	have	 the 	 ir 	 	 advantage 	 s 	 	,	but	I	 believ 	 e 	 	we	should	understand	the	 cost 	 s 	 	.
Thank	you	.

 Mi 	 ha 	 ly 	 	Csikszentmihalyi	on	flow
I	grew	up	in	 Euro 	 pe 	 	,	and	World	War	 I 	 I 	 	caught	me	when	I	was	between	seven	and	10	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
And	I	 real 	 ized 	 	how	few	of	the	 grown 	 - 	 up 	 s 	 	that	I	 k 	 new 	 	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	 with 	 stand 	 	the	 tra 	 ged 	 ies 	 	that	the	war	 visit 	 ed 	 	on	them	--	how	few	of	them	could	even	resemble	a	normal	,	 content 	 ed 	 	,	satisfied	,	happy	life	once	 the 	 ir 	 	job	,	 the 	 ir 	 	home	,	 the 	 ir 	 	security	was	 destroy 	 ed 	 	by	the	war	.
So	I	 be 	 came 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 understand 	 ing 	 	what	 con 	 tribute 	 d 	 	to	a	life	that	was	worth	living	.
And	I	 tri 	 ed 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	child	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	teenager	,	to	read	 philosoph 	 y 	 	and	to	get	 involve 	 d 	 	in	art	and	 relig 	 ion 	 	and	 man 	 y 	 	other	ways	that	I	could	see	 a 	 s 	 	a	possible	answer	to	that	question	.
And	 final 	 ly 	 	I	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 en 	 counter 	 ing 	 	 psycho 	 logy 	 	by	chance	.
I	was	at	a	ski	resort	in	 Switzer 	 land 	 	 with 	 out 	 	any	money	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	enjoy	 my 	 self 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	snow	had	 melt 	 ed 	 	and	I	did	n't	have	money	to	go	to	a	movie	.	But	I	found	that	on	the	--	I	read	in	the	 news 	 paper 	 s 	 	that	there	was	to	be	a	 present 	 ation 	 	by	 some 	 one 	 	in	a	place	that	I	'd	 s 	 een 	 	in	the	center	of	Zurich	,	and	it	was	about	 fly 	 ing 	 	 saucer 	 s 	 	[	that	]	he	was	going	to	talk	.
And	I	thought	,	well	,	since	I	ca	n't	go	to	the	 movie 	 s 	 	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	I	will	go	for	free	to	listen	to	 fly 	 ing 	 	 saucer 	 s 	 	.
And	the	man	who	 talk 	 ed 	 	at	that	 even 	 ing 	 	 lectur 	 e 	 	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
 In 	 stead 	 	of	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	little	green	men	,	he	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	how	the	 psych 	 e 	 	of	the	 European 	 s 	 	had	 be 	 en 	 	 trauma 	 t 	 ized 	 	by	the	war	,	and	now	they	're	 project 	 ing 	 	 fly 	 ing 	 	 saucer 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	sky	.
He	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	how	the	 man 	 d 	 ala 	 s 	 	of	ancient	Hindu	 relig 	 ion 	 	 we 	 re 	 	kind	of	 project 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	sky	 a 	 s 	 	an	attempt	to	regain	some	sense	of	order	after	the	 cha 	 os 	 	of	war	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	 seem 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	to	me	.
And	I	 start 	 ed 	 	 read 	 ing 	 	his	 book 	 s 	 	after	that	 lectur 	 e 	 	.
And	that	was	Carl	Jung	,	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	name	or	work	I	had	no	idea	about	.
 Th 	 en 	 	I	came	to	 th 	 is 	 	country	to	 stud 	 y 	 	 psycho 	 logy 	 	and	I	 start 	 ed 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	the	 root 	 s 	 	of	happiness	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	typical	result	that	 man 	 y 	 	people	have	 present 	 ed 	 	,	and	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 vari 	 ations 	 	on	it	.
But	 th 	 is 	 	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	 show 	 s 	 	that	about	30	percent	of	the	people	 survey 	 ed 	 	in	the	 Unit 	 ed 	 	 Stat 	 es 	 	since	1956	say	that	 the 	 ir 	 	life	is	 ver 	 y 	 	happy	.
And	that	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 change 	 d 	 	at	all	.
 Where 	 a 	 s 	 	the	personal	income	,	on	a	scale	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	held	constant	to	 accommo 	 date 	 	for	 infla 	 tion 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	more	than	 double 	 d 	 	,	 al 	 most 	 	 triple 	 d 	 	,	in	that	period	.
But	you	find	 essential 	 ly 	 	the	same	 result 	 s 	 	,	 name 	 ly 	 	,	that	after	a	certain	 bas 	 ic 	 	point	--	which	 correspond 	 s 	 	more	or	less	to	just	a	few	1,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	above	the	 minim 	 um 	 	poverty	level	--	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	in	material	 well 	 - 	 be 	 ing 	 	do	n't	seem	to	affect	how	happy	people	are	.
In	fact	,	you	can	find	that	the	lack	of	 bas 	 ic 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	,	material	 resource 	 s 	 	,	 con 	 tribute 	 s 	 	to	 un 	 happiness 	 	,	but	the	 in 	 crease 	 	in	material	 resource 	 s 	 	 do 	 es 	 	not	 in 	 crease 	 	happiness	.
So	my	research	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	focused	more	on	--	after	 find 	 ing 	 	out	these	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 correspond 	 ed 	 	to	my	own	experience	,	I	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	understand	:	where	--	in	 every 	 day 	 	life	,	in	our	normal	experience	--	do	we	feel	 re 	 ally 	 	happy	?
And	to	start	 t 	 hose 	 	 stud 	 ies 	 	about	40	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	I	 beg 	 an 	 	to	look	at	creative	people	--	first	 artist 	 s 	 	and	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	and	so	forth	--	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	what	made	them	feel	that	it	was	worth	 essential 	 ly 	 	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	life	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	for	which	 man 	 y 	 	of	them	did	n't	expect	either	fame	or	fortune	,	but	which	made	 the 	 ir 	 	life	 meaning 	 ful 	 	and	worth	 do 	 ing 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	was	one	of	the	 lead 	 ing 	 	 compose 	 rs 	 	of	American	music	back	in	the	'70s	.
And	the	interview	was	40	 page 	 s 	 	long	.
But	 th 	 is 	 	little	excerpt	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 summ 	 ary 	 	of	what	he	was	 say 	 ing 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	interview	.
And	it	 de 	 scribe 	 s 	 	how	he	 feel 	 s 	 	when	 com 	 posing 	 	is	going	well	.
And	he	 say 	 s 	 	by	 de 	 s 	 crib 	 ing 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	an	 ec 	 static 	 	state	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	``	 ecstas 	 y 	 	''	in	Greek	 me 	 ant 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	to	stand	to	the	side	of	 some 	 thing 	 	.
And	then	it	 be 	 came 	 	 essential 	 ly 	 	an	 analog 	 y 	 	for	a	mental	state	where	you	feel	that	you	are	not	 do 	 ing 	 	your	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 every 	 day 	 	 routine 	 s 	 	.
So	 ecstas 	 y 	 	is	 essential 	 ly 	 	a	 step 	 ping 	 	 in 	 to 	 	an	 alter 	 native 	 	 re 	 ality 	 	.
And	it	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	if	you	think	about	it	,	how	,	when	we	think	about	the	 civil 	 ization 	 s 	 	that	we	look	up	to	 a 	 s 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 pinnacle 	 s 	 	of	human	 achiev 	 ement 	 	--	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	China	,	Greece	,	the	Hindu	 civil 	 ization 	 	,	or	the	 Maya 	 s 	 	,	or	 Egyptian 	 s 	 	--	what	we	know	about	them	is	 re 	 ally 	 	about	 the 	 ir 	 	 ecstas 	 ies 	 	,	not	about	 the 	 ir 	 	 every 	 day 	 	life	.
We	know	the	 temple 	 s 	 	they	built	,	where	people	could	come	to	experience	a	different	 re 	 ality 	 	.
We	know	about	the	 circus 	 es 	 	,	the	 arena 	 s 	 	,	the	 theater 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	the	 remain 	 s 	 	of	 civil 	 ization 	 s 	 	and	they	are	the	 place 	 s 	 	that	people	went	to	experience	life	in	a	more	 concent 	 rated 	 	,	more	 order 	 ed 	 	form	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	man	 do 	 es 	 	n't	need	to	go	to	a	place	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	which	is	 al 	 so 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	place	,	 th 	 is 	 	arena	,	which	is	built	like	a	Greek	 amphi 	 theatre 	 	,	is	a	place	for	 ecstas 	 y 	 	 al 	 so 	 	.
We	are	 particip 	 ating 	 	in	a	 re 	 ality 	 	that	is	different	from	that	of	the	 every 	 day 	 	life	that	we	're	used	to	.
But	 th 	 is 	 	man	 do 	 es 	 	n't	need	to	go	there	.
He	 need 	 s 	 	just	a	piece	of	paper	where	he	can	put	down	little	 mark 	 s 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	he	 do 	 es 	 	that	,	he	can	imagine	 sound 	 s 	 	that	had	not	 exist 	 ed 	 	before	in	that	 part 	 icular 	 	combination	.
So	once	he	 get 	 s 	 	to	that	point	of	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	create	,	like	 Jenn 	 ifer 	 	did	in	her	improvisation	,	a	new	 re 	 ality 	 	--	that	is	,	a	moment	of	 ecstas 	 y 	 	--	he	 enter 	 s 	 	that	different	 re 	 ality 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	he	 say 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	so	 intens 	 e 	 	an	experience	that	it	 feel 	 s 	 	 al 	 most 	 	 a 	 s 	 	if	he	did	n't	exist	.
And	that	 sound 	 s 	 	like	a	kind	of	a	romantic	 exagge 	 ration 	 	.
But	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	our	nervous	system	is	 in 	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 process 	 ing 	 	more	than	about	110	bits	of	information	per	second	.
And	in	order	to	hear	me	and	understand	what	I	'm	 say 	 ing 	 	,	you	need	to	process	about	60	bits	per	second	.
That	's	why	you	ca	n't	hear	more	than	two	people	.
You	ca	n't	understand	more	than	two	people	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	you	.
Well	,	when	you	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	 engag 	 ing 	 	process	of	creating	 some 	 thing 	 	new	,	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	man	is	,	he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	 en 	 ough 	 	attention	left	over	to	monitor	how	his	body	 feel 	 s 	 	,	or	his	 problem 	 s 	 	at	home	.
He	ca	n't	feel	even	that	he	's	 hung 	 ry 	 	or	 tire 	 d 	 	.
 Hi 	 s 	 	body	 disappear 	 s 	 	,	his	 ident 	 ity 	 	 disappear 	 s 	 	from	his	 conscious 	 ness 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	 en 	 ough 	 	attention	,	like	 non 	 e 	 	of	us	do	,	to	 re 	 ally 	 	do	well	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 requir 	 es 	 	a	lot	of	 concent 	 ration 	 	,	and	at	the	same	time	to	feel	that	he	 exist 	 s 	 	.
So	 exist 	 ence 	 	is	 tempor 	 arily 	 	 suspend 	 ed 	 	.
And	he	 say 	 s 	 	that	his	hand	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	moving	by	 it 	 self 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	I	could	look	at	my	hand	for	two	 week 	 s 	 	,	and	I	would	n't	feel	any	awe	or	wonder	,	 be 	 cause 	 	I	ca	n't	compose	.
So	what	it	's	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	here	is	that	 obvious 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 autom 	 atic 	 	,	 spontane 	 ous 	 	process	that	he	's	 de 	 s 	 crib 	 ing 	 	can	 on 	 ly 	 	happen	to	 some 	 one 	 	who	is	 ver 	 y 	 	well	trained	and	who	 ha 	 s 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	 techni 	 que 	 	.
And	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	a	kind	of	a	truism	in	the	 stud 	 y 	 	of	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	that	you	ca	n't	be	creating	 any 	 thing 	 	with	less	than	10	 year 	 s 	 	of	 technical 	 - 	 knowledge 	 	 immers 	 ion 	 	in	a	 part 	 icular 	 	field	.
 W 	 he 	 ther 	 	it	's	 mathematic 	 s 	 	or	music	,	it	 take 	 s 	 	that	long	to	be	able	to	begin	to	change	 some 	 thing 	 	in	a	way	that	it	's	better	than	what	was	there	before	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	when	that	 happen 	 s 	 	,	he	 say 	 s 	 	the	music	just	 flow 	 s 	 	out	.
And	 be 	 cause 	 	all	of	these	people	I	 start 	 ed 	 	 interview 	 ing 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	was	an	interview	which	is	over	30	 year 	 s 	 	old	--	so	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	people	 de 	 scribed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 spontane 	 ous 	 	flow	that	I	 call 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	type	of	experience	the	``	flow	experience	.	''
And	it	 happen 	 s 	 	in	different	 realm 	 s 	 	.
For	 in 	 stance 	 	,	a	poet	 de 	 scribe 	 s 	 	it	in	 th 	 is 	 	form	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	by	a	student	of	mine	who	 interview 	 ed 	 	some	of	the	 lead 	 ing 	 	 writer 	 s 	 	and	 poet 	 s 	 	in	the	 Unit 	 ed 	 	 Stat 	 es 	 	.
And	it	 de 	 scribe 	 s 	 	the	same	 effort 	 less 	 	,	 spontane 	 ous 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	that	you	get	when	you	enter	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 ec 	 static 	 	state	.
 Th 	 is 	 	poet	 de 	 scribe 	 s 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	 open 	 ing 	 	a	door	that	 float 	 s 	 	in	the	sky	--	a	 ver 	 y 	 	similar	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	to	what	 Al 	 bert 	 	Einstein	 g 	 ave 	 	 a 	 s 	 	to	how	he	 imagin 	 ed 	 	the	 force 	 s 	 	of	 relat 	 ivity 	 	,	when	he	was	 st 	 rug 	 gling 	 	with	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	how	it	 work 	 ed 	 	.
But	it	 happen 	 s 	 	in	other	 activ 	 ities 	 	.
For	 in 	 stance 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	student	of	mine	,	Susan	 Jack 	 son 	 	from	Australia	,	who	did	work	with	some	of	the	 lead 	 ing 	 	 athlete 	 s 	 	in	the	world	.
And	you	see	here	in	 th 	 is 	 	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	of	an	 Olymp 	 ic 	 	 s 	 ka 	 ter 	 	,	the	same	essential	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	of	the	 phenomen 	 ology 	 	of	the	inner	state	of	the	person	.
You	do	n't	think	;	it	 go 	 es 	 	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	,	if	you	merge	 your 	 self 	 	with	the	music	,	and	so	forth	.
It	 happen 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	in	the	most	 re 	 cent 	 	book	I	wrote	,	 call 	 ed 	 	``	Good	 Bu 	 s 	 iness 	 	,	''	where	I	 interview 	 ed 	 	some	of	the	 CEO 	 s 	 	who	had	 be 	 en 	 	 nominate 	 d 	 	by	 the 	 ir 	 	 peer 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	both	 ver 	 y 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 ethic 	 al 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 social 	 ly 	 	 respons 	 ible 	 	.
You	see	that	these	people	define	success	 a 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 help 	 s 	 	 other 	 s 	 	and	at	the	same	time	 make 	 s 	 	you	feel	happy	 a 	 s 	 	you	are	 work 	 ing 	 	at	it	.
And	like	all	of	these	 success 	 ful 	 	and	 respons 	 ible 	 	 CEO 	 s 	 	say	,	you	ca	n't	have	just	one	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	be	 success 	 ful 	 	if	you	want	a	 meaning 	 ful 	 	and	 success 	 ful 	 	job	.
 An 	 ita 	 	 Rod 	 d 	 ick 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	one	of	these	 CEO 	 s 	 	we	 interview 	 ed 	 	.
She	is	the	founder	of	Body	Shop	,	the	natural	 cosmetic 	 s 	 	king	.
It	's	kind	of	a	 pass 	 ion 	 	that	 come 	 s 	 	from	 do 	 ing 	 	the	best	and	 hav 	 ing 	 	flow	while	you	're	 work 	 ing 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	little	quote	from	Masaru	Ibuka	,	who	was	at	that	time	 start 	 ing 	 	out	 Son 	 y 	 	 with 	 out 	 	any	money	,	 with 	 out 	 	a	product	--	they	did	n't	have	a	product	,	they	did	n't	have	 any 	 thing 	 	,	but	they	had	an	idea	.
And	the	idea	he	had	was	to	establish	a	place	of	work	where	 engineer 	 s 	 	can	feel	the	joy	of	 techno 	 logical 	 	 innov 	 ation 	 	,	be	aware	of	 the 	 ir 	 	mission	to	 socie 	 ty 	 	and	work	to	 the 	 ir 	 	heart	's	content	.
I	could	n't	improve	on	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	good	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	how	flow	 enter 	 s 	 	the	 work 	 place 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	when	we	do	 stud 	 ies 	 	--	we	have	,	with	other	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	around	the	world	,	 d 	 one 	 	over	8,000	 interview 	 s 	 	of	people	--	from	 Dominic 	 an 	 	 monk 	 s 	 	,	to	blind	 n 	 un 	 s 	 	,	to	 Himalaya 	 n 	 	 climb 	 ers 	 	,	to	Navajo	 shepherd 	 s 	 	--	who	enjoy	 the 	 ir 	 	work	.
And	 regard 	 less 	 	of	the	culture	,	 regard 	 less 	 	of	education	or	 what 	 ever 	 	,	there	are	these	seven	 condition 	 s 	 	that	seem	to	be	there	when	a	person	is	in	flow	.
There	's	 th 	 is 	 	focus	that	,	once	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 intens 	 e 	 	,	 lead 	 s 	 	to	a	sense	of	 ecstas 	 y 	 	,	a	sense	of	 clar 	 ity 	 	:	you	know	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	you	want	to	do	from	one	moment	to	the	other	;	you	get	 im 	 mediate 	 	 feed 	 back 	 	.
You	know	that	what	you	need	to	do	is	possible	to	do	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	difficult	,	and	sense	of	time	 disappear 	 s 	 	,	you	forget	 your 	 self 	 	,	you	feel	part	of	 some 	 thing 	 	 large 	 r 	 	.
And	once	the	 condition 	 s 	 	are	present	,	what	you	are	 do 	 ing 	 	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	worth	 do 	 ing 	 	for	 it 	 s 	 	own	sake	.
In	our	 stud 	 ies 	 	,	we	represent	the	 every 	 day 	 	life	of	people	in	 th 	 is 	 	simple	scheme	.
And	we	can	measure	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 precise 	 ly 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	give	people	 electron 	 ic 	 	 page 	 rs 	 	that	go	off	10	 time 	 s 	 	a	day	,	and	 when 	 ever 	 	they	go	off	you	say	what	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	,	how	you	feel	,	where	you	are	,	what	you	're	 think 	 ing 	 	about	.
And	two	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	measure	is	the	amount	of	 challeng 	 e 	 	people	experience	at	that	moment	and	the	amount	of	skill	that	they	feel	they	have	at	that	moment	.
So	for	each	person	we	can	establish	an	average	,	which	is	the	center	of	the	 dia 	 gram 	 	.
That	would	be	your	mean	level	of	 challeng 	 e 	 	and	skill	,	which	will	be	different	from	that	of	 any 	 body 	 	else	.
But	you	have	a	kind	of	a	set	point	there	,	which	would	be	in	the	middle	.
If	we	know	what	that	set	point	is	,	we	can	predict	 fair 	 ly 	 	 accurate 	 ly 	 	when	you	will	be	in	flow	,	and	it	will	be	when	your	 challeng 	 es 	 	are	 high 	 er 	 	than	average	and	 skill 	 s 	 	are	 high 	 er 	 	than	average	.
And	you	may	be	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	from	other	people	,	but	for	 every 	 one 	 	that	flow	channel	,	that	area	there	,	will	be	when	you	are	 do 	 ing 	 	what	you	 re 	 ally 	 	like	to	do	--	play	the	piano	,	be	with	your	best	friend	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	work	,	if	work	is	what	 provide 	 s 	 	flow	for	you	.
And	then	the	other	 area 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	less	and	less	positive	.
 Aro 	 usal 	 	is	still	good	 be 	 cause 	 	you	are	 over 	 - 	 challeng 	 ed 	 	there	.
Your	 skill 	 s 	 	are	not	 quit 	 e 	 	 a 	 s 	 	high	 a 	 s 	 	they	should	be	,	but	you	can	move	 in 	 to 	 	flow	 fair 	 ly 	 	 eas 	 ily 	 	by	just	 develop 	 ing 	 	a	little	more	skill	.
So	,	arousal	is	the	area	where	most	people	learn	from	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	where	they	're	 push 	 ed 	 	beyond	 the 	 ir 	 	comfort	zone	and	to	enter	that	--	going	back	to	flow	--	then	they	develop	 high 	 er 	 	 skill 	 s 	 	.
Control	is	 al 	 so 	 	a	good	place	to	be	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	you	feel	 comfort 	 able 	 	,	but	not	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	.
It	's	not	 ver 	 y 	 	 challeng 	 ing 	 	any	more	.
And	if	you	want	to	enter	flow	from	control	,	you	have	to	 in 	 crease 	 	the	 challeng 	 es 	 	.
So	 t 	 hose 	 	two	are	ideal	and	 comple 	 ment 	 ary 	 	 area 	 s 	 	from	which	flow	is	easy	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	.
The	other	 combination 	 s 	 	of	 challeng 	 e 	 	and	skill	 be 	 come 	 	 progress 	 ively 	 	less	optimal	.
 Re 	 lax 	 ation 	 	is	fine	--	you	still	feel	 O 	 K 	 	.
 Bo 	 re 	 dom 	 	 begin 	 s 	 	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	aversive	and	 a 	 pathy 	 	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	negative	:	you	do	n't	feel	that	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	,	you	do	n't	use	your	 skill 	 s 	 	,	there	's	no	 challeng 	 e 	 	.
 Un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	a	lot	of	people	's	experience	is	in	 a 	 pathy 	 	.
The	largest	single	contributor	to	that	experience	is	 watch 	 ing 	 	 tele 	 vision 	 	;	the	next	one	is	 be 	 ing 	 	in	the	 bath 	 room 	 	,	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	.
Even	 th 	 ough 	 	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 watch 	 ing 	 	 tele 	 vision 	 	about	seven	to	eight	percent	of	the	time	is	in	flow	,	but	that	's	when	you	 choos 	 e 	 	a	program	you	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	watch	and	you	get	 feed 	 back 	 	from	it	.
So	the	question	we	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	address	--	and	I	'm	way	over	time	--	is	how	to	put	more	and	more	of	 every 	 day 	 	life	in	that	flow	channel	.
And	that	is	the	kind	of	 challeng 	 e 	 	that	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	.
And	some	of	you	 obvious 	 ly 	 	know	how	to	do	that	 spontane 	 ously 	 	 with 	 out 	 	any	 ad 	 vice 	 	,	but	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	a	lot	of	people	do	n't	.
And	that	's	what	our	 man 	 date 	 	is	,	in	a	way	,	to	do	.
Thank	you	.

 For 	 rest 	 	North	:	The	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	any	 collabor 	 ation 	 	 start 	 s 	 	with	a	conversation	.
And	I	would	like	to	share	with	you	some	of	the	bits	of	the	conversation	that	we	 start 	 ed 	 	with	.
I	grew	up	in	a	log	 cab 	 in 	 	in	 Wash 	 ington 	 	state	with	too	much	time	on	my	 hand 	 s 	 	.
 Y 	 ves 	 	 Be 	 har 	 	:	And	in	 scen 	 ic 	 	 Switzer 	 land 	 	for	me	.
 F 	 N 	 	:	I	 al 	 ways 	 	had	a	 pass 	 ion 	 	for	 alter 	 native 	 	 vehicle 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	land	yacht	 rac 	 ing 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	desert	in	Nevada	.
 Y 	 B 	 	:	 Comb 	 in 	 ation 	 	of	 wind 	 surfing 	 	and	 ski 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 invent 	 ion 	 	there	.
 F 	 N 	 	:	And	I	 al 	 so 	 	had	an	interest	in	 danger 	 ous 	 	 invent 	 ions 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	100,000-volt	Tesla	coil	that	I	built	in	my	 bed 	 room 	 	,	much	to	the	 dis 	 may 	 	of	my	mother	.
 Y 	 B 	 	:	To	the	 dis 	 may 	 	of	my	mother	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 danger 	 ous 	 	 teen 	 age 	 	fashion	right	there	.
 F 	 N 	 	:	And	I	 br 	 ought 	 	 th 	 is 	 	all	together	,	 th 	 is 	 	 pass 	 ion 	 	with	 alter 	 native 	 	energy	and	 rac 	 ed 	 	a	solar	car	 a 	 cross 	 	Australia	--	 al 	 so 	 	the	U.S.	and	Japan	.
 Y 	 B 	 	:	So	,	wind	power	,	solar	power	--	we	had	a	lot	to	talk	about	.
We	had	a	lot	that	got	us	 excit 	 ed 	 	.
So	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	do	a	special	project	together	.
To	combine	 engineer 	 ing 	 	and	design	and	...
 F 	 N 	 	:	 Re 	 ally 	 	make	a	fully	 integrate 	 d 	 	product	,	 some 	 thing 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
 Y 	 B 	 	:	And	we	made	a	baby	.
 F 	 N 	 	:	Can	you	 br 	 ing 	 	out	our	baby	?
 Th 	 is 	 	baby	is	fully	electric	.
It	 go 	 es 	 	150	 mile 	 s 	 	an	hour	.
It	's	twice	the	range	of	any	electric	 motor 	 cycle 	 	.
 Re 	 ally 	 	the	 excit 	 ing 	 	thing	about	a	 motor 	 cycle 	 	is	just	the	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 integ 	 ration 	 	of	 engineer 	 ing 	 	and	design	.
It	's	got	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	user	experience	.
It	was	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	with	 Y 	 ves 	 	 Be 	 har 	 	.
He	came	up	with	our	name	and	logo	.	We	're	 Miss 	 ion 	 	 Motor 	 s 	 	.
And	we	've	 on 	 ly 	 	got	three	 minute 	 s 	 	,	but	we	could	talk	about	it	for	 hour 	 s 	 	.
 Y 	 B 	 	:	Thank	you	.

When	 philanthro 	 py 	 	was	 re 	 invent 	 ed 	 	a	century	ago	,	when	the	 found 	 ation 	 	form	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 invent 	 ed 	 	,	they	did	n't	think	of	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	on	the	wrong	side	of	these	either	.
In	fact	they	would	never	have	thought	of	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 a 	 s 	 	closed	and	set	in	 the 	 ir 	 	ways	,	 a 	 s 	 	 s 	 low 	 	to	respond	to	new	 challeng 	 es 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	small	and	 risk 	 - 	 a 	 verse 	 	.
And	in	fact	they	 we 	 re 	 	n't	.	 The 	 y 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 invent 	 ing 	 	 char 	 ity 	 	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 time 	 s 	 	,	what	 Rock 	 efeller 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	``	the	business	of	 benevol 	 ence 	 	.	''
But	by	the	end	of	the	20th	century	,	a	new	generation	of	 critic 	 s 	 	and	 reform 	 ers 	 	had	come	to	see	 philanthro 	 py 	 	just	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
The	thing	to	watch	for	 a 	 s 	 	a	global	 philanthro 	 py 	 	industry	 come 	 s 	 	about	--	and	that	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	--	is	how	the	 aspir 	 ation 	 	is	to	flip	these	old	 assumption 	 s 	 	,	for	 philanthro 	 py 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	open	and	big	and	fast	and	 connect 	 ed 	 	,	in	service	of	the	long	term	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 entrepreneur 	 ial 	 	energy	is	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	from	 man 	 y 	 	 quarter 	 s 	 	.
And	it	's	driven	and	 propel 	 led 	 	forward	by	new	 lead 	 ers 	 	,	like	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	people	here	,	by	new	 tool 	 s 	 	,	like	the	 one 	 s 	 	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	here	,	and	by	new	 pressure 	 s 	 	.
I	've	 be 	 en 	 	 follow 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	change	for	 quit 	 e 	 	a	while	now	,	and	 particip 	 ating 	 	in	it	.
 Th 	 is 	 	report	is	our	main	public	report	.
What	it	 tell 	 s 	 	is	the	story	of	how	 to 	 day 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	could	be	 a 	 s 	 	historic	 a 	 s 	 	100	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
What	I	want	to	do	is	share	some	of	the	 cool 	 est 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	going	on	with	you	.
And	 a 	 s 	 	I	do	that	,	I	'm	not	going	to	 d 	 well 	 	much	on	the	 ver 	 y 	 	large	 philanthro 	 py 	 	that	 every 	 body 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	 know 	 s 	 	about	--	the	 Gate 	 s 	 	or	the	 So 	 ros 	 	or	the	Google	.
 In 	 stead 	 	,	what	I	want	to	do	is	talk	about	the	 philanthro 	 py 	 	of	all	of	us	:	the	 democrat 	 ization 	 	of	 philanthro 	 py 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	moment	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	when	the	average	person	 ha 	 s 	 	more	power	than	at	any	time	.
What	I	'm	going	to	do	is	look	at	five	 categor 	 ies 	 	of	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	each	of	which	 challeng 	 es 	 	an	old	assumption	of	 philanthro 	 py 	 	.
The	first	is	mass	 collabor 	 ation 	 	,	 represent 	 ed 	 	here	by	Wikipedia	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	may	surprise	you	.
But	remember	,	 philanthro 	 py 	 	is	about	giving	of	time	and	talent	,	not	just	money	.
 C 	 lay 	 	 Shi 	 rky 	 	,	that	great	 chronic 	 ler 	 	of	 every 	 thing 	 	 network 	 ed 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 capture 	 d 	 	the	assumption	that	 th 	 is 	 	 challeng 	 es 	 	in	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	way	.
He	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	We	have	lived	in	 th 	 is 	 	world	where	little	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 d 	 one 	 	for	love	and	big	 thing 	 s 	 	for	money	.
 N 	 ow 	 	we	have	Wikipedia	.
 Sud 	 den 	 ly 	 	big	 thing 	 s 	 	can	be	 d 	 one 	 	for	love	.	''
 Wat 	 ch 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	spring	,	for	Paul	 Hawk 	 en 	 	's	new	book	--	Author	and	entrepreneur	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	may	know	about	.
The	book	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 B 	 less 	 ed 	 	 Un 	 rest 	 	.	''
And	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	out	,	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	wiki	 s 	 ites 	 	under	the	label	 WISE 	 R 	 	,	are	going	to	launch	at	the	same	time	.
 WISE 	 R 	 	 stand 	 s 	 	for	World	 In 	 d 	 ex 	 	for	 So 	 cial 	 	and	 Environment 	 al 	 	 Respons 	 ibility 	 	.
 WISE 	 R 	 	 set 	 s 	 	out	to	document	,	link	and	empower	what	Paul	 call 	 s 	 	the	largest	 move 	 ment 	 	,	and	 fast 	 est 	 - 	 growing 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	in	human	 histo 	 ry 	 	:	 human 	 ity 	 	's	 collect 	 ive 	 	 immun 	 e 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	to	 to 	 day 	 	's	 threat 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	all	of	these	big	 thing 	 s 	 	for	love	--	 experiment 	 s 	 	--	are	n't	going	to	take	off	.
But	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	do	are	going	to	be	the	 big 	 gest 	 	,	the	most	open	,	the	 fast 	 est 	 	,	the	most	 connect 	 ed 	 	form	of	 philanthro 	 py 	 	in	human	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
Second	 categor 	 y 	 	is	 on 	 line 	 	 philanthro 	 py 	 	 market 	 place 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	,	of	course	,	to	 philanthro 	 py 	 	what	 e 	 Bay 	 	and	Amazon	are	to	commerce	.
Think	of	it	 a 	 s 	 	 peer 	 - 	 to 	 - 	 peer 	 	 philanthro 	 py 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	 challeng 	 es 	 	yet	 an 	 other 	 	assumption	,	which	is	that	 organize 	 d 	 	 philanthro 	 py 	 	is	 on 	 ly 	 	for	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 wealth 	 y 	 	.
Take	a	look	,	if	you	have	n't	,	at	 Don 	 ors 	 Choos 	 e 	 	.
Omidyar	 Net 	 work 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	made	a	big	 invest 	 ment 	 	in	 Don 	 ors 	 Choos 	 e 	 	.
It	's	one	of	the	best	known	of	these	new	 market 	 place 	 s 	 	where	a	donor	can	go	straight	 in 	 to 	 	a	 class 	 room 	 	and	connect	with	what	a	teacher	 say 	 s 	 	they	need	.
Take	a	look	at	 Chan 	 ging 	 	the	Present	,	 start 	 ed 	 	by	a	 TED 	 ster 	 	,	next	time	you	need	a	 wed 	 d 	 ing 	 	present	or	a	 holi 	 day 	 	present	.
 G 	 ive 	 India 	 	is	for	a	whole	country	.
And	it	 go 	 es 	 	on	and	on	.
The	third	 categor 	 y 	 	is	 represent 	 ed 	 	by	 War 	 ren 	 	Buffet	,	which	I	call	 aggreg 	 ated 	 	giving	.
It	's	not	just	that	 War 	 ren 	 	Buffet	was	so	 amaz 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 gen 	 er 	 ous 	 	in	that	historic	act	last	summer	.
It	's	that	he	 challeng 	 ed 	 	 an 	 other 	 	assumption	,	that	every	giver	should	have	his	or	her	own	fund	or	 found 	 ation 	 	.
There	are	now	,	 to 	 day 	 	,	so	 man 	 y 	 	new	 fund 	 s 	 	that	are	 aggreg 	 ating 	 	giving	and	 invest 	 ing 	 	,	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	together	people	around	a	common	goal	,	to	think	 big 	 ger 	 	.
One	of	the	best	known	is	 A 	 cum 	 en 	 	Fund	,	led	by	 Jac 	 que 	 line 	 	 No 	 vogratz 	 	,	a	 TED 	 ster 	 	who	got	a	big	boost	here	at	TED	.
But	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 other 	 s 	 	:	New	 Pro 	 fit 	 	in	 Cam 	 bridge 	 	,	New	School	's	 Ven 	 ture 	 	Fund	in	Silicon	 Valle 	 y 	 	,	 Ven 	 ture 	 	 Phil 	 anthro 	 py 	 	Partners	in	 Wash 	 ington 	 	,	Global	Fund	for	Women	in	San	 Francis 	 co 	 	.
Take	a	look	at	these	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	 fund 	 s 	 	are	to	 philanthro 	 py 	 	what	venture	capital	,	private	 equ 	 ity 	 	,	and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	mutual	 fund 	 s 	 	are	to	 invest 	 ing 	 	,	but	with	a	twist	--	 be 	 cause 	 	often	a	community	 form 	 s 	 	around	these	 fund 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 ha 	 s 	 	at	 A 	 cum 	 en 	 	and	other	 place 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	imagine	for	a	second	these	first	three	 type 	 s 	 	of	 experiment 	 s 	 	:	mass	 collabor 	 ation 	 	,	 on 	 line 	 	 market 	 place 	 s 	 	,	 aggreg 	 ated 	 	giving	.
And	understand	how	they	help	us	 re 	 - 	 perceive 	 	what	 organize 	 d 	 	 philanthro 	 py 	 	is	.
It	's	not	about	 found 	 ations 	 	 necess 	 arily 	 	;	it	's	about	the	rest	of	us	.
And	imagine	the	 mash 	 - 	 up 	 	,	if	you	will	,	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	in	the	future	,	when	these	 thing 	 s 	 	come	together	in	the	 experiment 	 s 	 	of	the	future	--	imagine	that	 some 	 body 	 	 put 	 s 	 	up	,	say	,	100	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	for	an	inspiring	goal	--	there	 we 	 re 	 	21	 gift 	 s 	 	of	100	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	or	more	in	the	US	last	year	,	not	out	of	the	question	--	but	 on 	 ly 	 	 put 	 s 	 	it	up	if	it	's	 match 	 ed 	 	by	 million 	 s 	 	of	small	 gift 	 s 	 	from	around	the	 glob 	 e 	 	,	 there 	 by 	 	 engag 	 ing 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	people	,	and	building	 vis 	 ibility 	 	and	 engag 	 ing 	 	people	in	the	goal	that	's	 state 	 d 	 	.
I	'm	going	to	look	 quick 	 ly 	 	at	the	fourth	and	fifth	 categor 	 ies 	 	,	which	are	 innov 	 ation 	 	,	 com 	 petition 	 s 	 	and	social	 invest 	 ing 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	 bet 	 ting 	 	a	visible	 com 	 petition 	 	,	a	prize	,	can	attract	talent	and	money	to	some	of	the	most	difficult	 issue 	 s 	 	,	and	 there 	 by 	 	speed	the	solution	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 tackle 	 s 	 	yet	 an 	 other 	 	assumption	,	that	the	giver	and	the	 organ 	 ization 	 	is	at	the	center	,	 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	 put 	 ting 	 	the	problem	at	the	center	.
You	can	look	to	these	 innov 	 ators 	 	to	help	us	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	with	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 requir 	 e 	 	 techno 	 logical 	 	or	scientific	solution	.
That	 leav 	 es 	 	the	final	 categor 	 y 	 	,	social	 invest 	 ing 	 	,	which	is	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 any 	 way 	 	,	the	 big 	 gest 	 	of	them	all	,	 represent 	 ed 	 	here	by	 Xigi 	 .net 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	,	of	course	,	 tackle 	 s 	 	the	 big 	 gest 	 	assumption	of	all	,	that	business	is	business	,	and	 philanthro 	 py 	 	is	the	vehicle	of	people	who	want	to	create	change	in	the	world	.
Xigi	is	a	new	community	 s 	 ite 	 	that	's	built	by	the	community	,	 link 	 ing 	 	and	mapping	 th 	 is 	 	new	social	capital	market	.
It	 list 	 s 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	1,000	 ent 	 ities 	 	that	are	 off 	 er 	 ing 	 	debt	and	 equ 	 ity 	 	for	social	enterprise	.
So	we	can	look	to	these	 innov 	 ators 	 	to	help	us	remember	that	if	we	can	leverage	even	a	small	amount	of	the	capital	that	 seek 	 s 	 	a	return	,	the	good	that	can	be	driven	could	be	 astonish 	 ing 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	what	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	here	is	that	we	're	not	 think 	 ing 	 	our	way	 in 	 to 	 	a	new	way	of	 act 	 ing 	 	;	we	're	 act 	 ing 	 	our	way	 in 	 to 	 	a	new	way	of	 think 	 ing 	 	.
 Phil 	 anthro 	 py 	 	is	 re 	 organ 	 izing 	 	 it 	 self 	 	before	our	 ver 	 y 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	.
And	even	 th 	 ough 	 	all	of	the	 experiment 	 s 	 	and	all	of	the	big	 giver 	 s 	 	do	n't	yet	fulfill	 th 	 is 	 	 aspir 	 ation 	 	,	I	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	new	 zeitge 	 ist 	 	:	open	,	big	,	fast	,	 connect 	 ed 	 	,	and	,	let	us	 al 	 so 	 	hope	,	long	.
We	have	got	to	 real 	 ize 	 	that	it	is	going	to	take	a	long	time	to	do	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
If	we	do	n't	develop	the	 stam 	 ina 	 	to	stick	with	 thing 	 s 	 	--	 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	you	pick	,	stick	with	it	--	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	is	just	going	to	be	,	you	know	,	a	fad	.
But	I	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 hope 	 ful 	 	.
And	I	'm	 hope 	 ful 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 philanthro 	 py 	 	that	's	 re 	 organ 	 izing 	 	 it 	 self 	 	,	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	whole	other	 port 	 ions 	 	of	the	social	sector	,	and	of	business	,	that	are	 bus 	 y 	 	 challeng 	 ing 	 	``	business	 a 	 s 	 	usual	.	''
And	 every 	 where 	 	I	go	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	here	at	TED	,	I	feel	that	there	is	a	new	moral	 hung 	 er 	 	that	is	growing	.
What	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	is	people	 re 	 ally 	 	 wrestl 	 ing 	 	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	what	is	 th 	 is 	 	new	thing	that	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
 Word 	 s 	 	like	``	 philanthro 	 capital 	 ism 	 	,	''	and	``	natural	 capital 	 ism 	 	,	''	and	``	 philanthro 	 entrepreneur 	 	,	''	and	``	venture	 philanthro 	 py 	 	.	''
We	do	n't	have	a	language	for	it	yet	.
 What 	 ever 	 	we	call	it	,	it	's	new	,	it	's	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	and	I	think	it	's	gong	to	 quit 	 e 	 	significant	.
And	that	's	where	my	 imagin 	 ed 	 	future	 come 	 s 	 	in	,	which	I	am	going	to	call	the	social	 s 	 ing 	 ular 	 ity 	 	.
 Man 	 y 	 	of	you	will	 real 	 ize 	 	that	I	'm	 rip 	 ping 	 	a	bit	off	of	the	science	fiction	writer	 Ver 	 nor 	 	 V 	 ing 	 e 	 	's	 not 	 ion 	 	of	a	 techno 	 logical 	 	 s 	 ing 	 ular 	 ity 	 	,	where	a	number	of	 trend 	 s 	 	 accele 	 rate 	 	and	 converg 	 e 	 	and	come	together	to	create	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	a	 shock 	 ing 	 ly 	 	new	 re 	 ality 	 	.
It	may	be	that	the	social	 s 	 ing 	 ular 	 ity 	 	 a 	 head 	 	is	the	one	that	we	fear	the	most	:	a	 converg 	 ence 	 	of	 catastroph 	 es 	 	,	of	 environment 	 al 	 	degradation	,	of	 weapon 	 s 	 	of	mass	 destruct 	 ion 	 	,	of	 pan 	 demic 	 s 	 	,	of	poverty	.
That	's	 be 	 cause 	 	our	ability	to	confront	the	 problem 	 s 	 	that	we	face	 ha 	 s 	 	not	 ke 	 pt 	 	pace	with	our	ability	to	create	them	.
And	 a 	 s 	 	we	've	heard	here	,	it	is	no	 exagge 	 ration 	 	to	say	that	we	hold	the	future	of	our	 civil 	 ization 	 	in	our	 hand 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	never	before	.
The	question	is	,	is	there	a	positive	social	 s 	 ing 	 ular 	 ity 	 	?
 I 	 s 	 	there	a	 front 	 ier 	 	for	us	of	how	we	live	together	?
Our	future	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	to	be	 imagin 	 ed 	 	.
We	can	create	a	future	where	hope	and	 histo 	 ry 	 	 rhym 	 e 	 	.
But	we	have	a	problem	.
Our	experience	to	date	,	both	 individual 	 ly 	 	and	 collect 	 ively 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	prepared	us	for	what	we	're	going	to	need	to	do	,	or	who	we	're	going	to	need	to	be	.
We	are	going	to	need	a	new	generation	of	citizen	 lead 	 ers 	 	 will 	 ing 	 	to	commit	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	to	growing	and	changing	and	 learn 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 rapid 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	possible	.
That	's	why	I	have	one	last	thing	I	want	to	show	you	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	photograph	taken	about	100	 year 	 s 	 	ago	of	my	 grand 	 father 	 	and	 great 	 - 	 grand 	 father 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	 news 	 paper 	 	 publish 	 er 	 	and	a	 bank 	 er 	 	.
And	they	 we 	 re 	 	great	community	 lead 	 ers 	 	.
And	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	great	 philanthro 	 pist 	 s 	 	.
I	keep	 th 	 is 	 	photograph	close	by	to	me	--	it	's	in	my	 off 	 ice 	 	--	 be 	 cause 	 	I	've	 al 	 ways 	 	felt	a	 mystic 	 al 	 	 connect 	 ion 	 	to	these	two	men	,	both	of	whom	I	never	 k 	 new 	 	.
And	so	,	in	 the 	 ir 	 	honor	,	I	want	to	 off 	 er 	 	you	 th 	 is 	 	blank	slide	.
And	I	want	you	to	imagine	that	 th 	 is 	 	a	photograph	of	you	.
And	I	want	you	to	think	about	the	community	that	you	want	to	be	part	of	creating	.
 What 	 ever 	 	that	 mean 	 s 	 	to	you	.
And	I	want	you	to	imagine	that	it	's	100	 year 	 s 	 	from	now	,	and	your	 grand 	 child 	 	,	or	 great 	 - 	 grand 	 child 	 	,	or	niece	or	nephew	or	 god 	 - 	 child 	 	,	is	looking	at	 th 	 is 	 	photograph	of	you	.
What	is	the	story	you	most	want	for	them	to	tell	?
Thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.

 Han 	 na 	 	 Ro 	 s 	 in 	 	:	New	data	on	the	rise	of	women
We	are	now	going	through	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	and	unprecedented	moment	where	the	power	 dynamic 	 s 	 	between	men	and	women	are	shifting	 ver 	 y 	 	 rapid 	 ly 	 	,	and	in	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	 place 	 s 	 	where	it	 count 	 s 	 	the	most	,	women	are	,	in	fact	,	taking	control	of	 every 	 thing 	 	.
In	my	mother	's	day	,	she	did	n't	go	to	college	.
Not	a	lot	of	women	did	.
And	now	,	for	every	two	men	who	get	a	college	degree	,	three	women	will	do	the	same	.
Women	,	for	the	first	time	 th 	 is 	 	year	,	 be 	 came 	 	the	 major 	 ity 	 	of	the	American	 work 	 force 	 	.
And	they	're	 start 	 ing 	 	to	dominate	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 profession 	 s 	 	--	 doctor 	 s 	 	,	 lawyer 	 s 	 	,	 bank 	 ers 	 	,	 account 	 ants 	 	.
Over	50	percent	of	 manage 	 rs 	 	are	women	these	 day 	 s 	 	,	and	in	the	15	 profession 	 s 	 	 project 	 ed 	 	to	grow	the	most	in	the	next	decade	,	all	but	two	of	them	are	 dominate 	 d 	 	by	women	.
So	the	global	 eco 	 nomy 	 	is	 be 	 coming 	 	a	place	where	women	are	more	 success 	 ful 	 	than	men	,	 believ 	 e 	 	it	or	not	,	and	these	economic	 change 	 s 	 	are	 start 	 ing 	 	to	 rapid 	 ly 	 	affect	our	culture	--	what	our	romantic	 come 	 dies 	 	look	like	,	what	our	 marriage 	 s 	 	look	like	,	what	our	 d 	 ating 	 	 live 	 s 	 	look	like	,	and	our	new	set	of	 super 	 heroes 	 	.
For	a	long	time	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	image	of	American	 man 	 hood 	 	that	 dominate 	 d 	 	--	tough	,	 rug 	 ged 	 	,	in	control	of	his	own	environment	.
A	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	the	 Mar 	 lboro 	 	Man	was	 retire 	 d 	 	and	 replace 	 d 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	much	less	 impress 	 ive 	 	specimen	,	who	is	a	 paro 	 dy 	 	of	American	 man 	 hood 	 	,	and	that	's	what	we	have	in	our	 commercial 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
The	phrase	``	 first 	 - 	 born 	 	son	''	is	so	 deep 	 ly 	 	 ing 	 rain 	 ed 	 	in	our	 conscious 	 ness 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	statistic	 al 	 one 	 	 shock 	 ed 	 	me	.
In	American	 fertil 	 ity 	 	 clinic 	 s 	 	,	75	percent	of	 couple 	 s 	 	are	 request 	 ing 	 	 girl 	 s 	 	and	not	 boy 	 s 	 	.
And	in	 place 	 s 	 	where	you	would	n't	think	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	South	Korea	,	India	and	China	,	the	 ver 	 y 	 	strict	 patriarch 	 al 	 	 socie 	 ties 	 	are	 start 	 ing 	 	to	break	down	a	little	,	and	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	are	no	 long 	 er 	 	 strong 	 ly 	 	 prefer 	 ring 	 	 first 	 - 	 born 	 	 son 	 s 	 	.
If	you	think	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	if	you	just	open	your	 eye 	 s 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	 possibil 	 ity 	 	and	start	to	connect	the	 dot 	 s 	 	,	you	can	see	the	evidence	 every 	 where 	 	.
You	can	see	it	in	college	 gradu 	 ation 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	,	in	job	 project 	 ions 	 	,	in	our	marriage	 statistic 	 s 	 	,	you	can	see	it	in	the	 Ice 	 land 	 ic 	 	 election 	 s 	 	,	which	you	'll	hear	about	 lat 	 er 	 	,	and	you	can	see	it	on	South	Korean	 survey 	 s 	 	on	son	 pre 	 ference 	 	,	that	 some 	 thing 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	and	unprecedented	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	with	women	.
 Certain 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	the	first	time	that	we	've	had	great	progress	with	women	.
The	'20s	and	the	'60s	 al 	 so 	 	come	to	mind	.
But	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	is	that	,	back	then	,	it	was	driven	by	a	 ver 	 y 	 	passionate	feminist	 move 	 ment 	 	that	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	project	 it 	 s 	 	own	 desir 	 es 	 	,	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	time	,	it	's	not	about	 pass 	 ion 	 	,	and	it	's	not	about	any	kind	of	 move 	 ment 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	just	about	the	 fact 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	economic	moment	that	we	live	in	.
The	200,000-year	period	in	which	men	have	 be 	 en 	 	top	dog	is	 tru 	 ly 	 	coming	to	an	end	,	 believ 	 e 	 	it	or	not	,	and	that	's	why	I	talk	about	the	``	end	of	men	.	''
 N 	 ow 	 	all	you	men	out	there	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	the	moment	where	you	tune	out	or	throw	some	 tomato 	 es 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	point	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	to	all	of	us	.
I	 my 	 self 	 	have	a	husband	and	a	father	and	two	 son 	 s 	 	whom	I	 d 	 early 	 	love	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	why	I	like	to	talk	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	we	do	n't	 acknowledg 	 e 	 	it	,	then	the	 transit 	 ion 	 	will	be	 pre 	 tty 	 	 pain 	 ful 	 	.
But	if	we	do	take	account	of	it	,	then	I	think	it	will	go	much	more	 smooth 	 ly 	 	.
I	first	 start 	 ed 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	about	a	year	and	a	half	ago	.
I	was	 read 	 ing 	 	 head 	 lines 	 	about	the	 recess 	 ion 	 	just	like	 any 	 one 	 	else	,	and	I	 start 	 ed 	 	to	notice	a	distinct	pattern	--	that	the	 recess 	 ion 	 	was	 affect 	 ing 	 	men	much	more	 deep 	 ly 	 	than	it	was	 affect 	 ing 	 	women	.
And	I	 remember 	 ed 	 	back	to	about	10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	when	I	read	a	book	by	Susan	Faludi	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 Stiff 	 ed 	 	:	The	Betrayal	of	the	American	Man	,	''	in	which	she	 de 	 scribed 	 	how	hard	the	 recess 	 ion 	 	had	hit	men	,	and	I	 start 	 ed 	 	to	think	about	 whet 	 her 	 	it	had	gotten	 wo 	 rse 	 	 th 	 is 	 	time	around	in	 th 	 is 	 	 recess 	 ion 	 	.
And	I	 real 	 ized 	 	that	two	 thing 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	different	 th 	 is 	 	time	around	.
The	first	was	that	these	 we 	 re 	 	no	 long 	 er 	 	just	 tempor 	 ary 	 	 hit 	 s 	 	that	the	 recess 	 ion 	 	was	giving	men	--	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	 reflect 	 ing 	 	a	 deep 	 er 	 	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	shift	in	our	global	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
And	second	,	that	the	story	was	no	 long 	 er 	 	just	about	the	crisis	of	men	,	but	it	was	 al 	 so 	 	about	what	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	to	women	.
And	now	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	second	set	of	 slide 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	 head 	 lines 	 	about	what	's	 be 	 en 	 	going	on	with	women	in	the	next	few	 year 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	 thing 	 s 	 	we	never	could	have	 imagin 	 ed 	 	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
Women	,	a	 major 	 ity 	 	of	the	 work 	 place 	 	.
And	labor	 statistic 	 s 	 	:	women	take	up	most	 manage 	 rial 	 	 job 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	second	set	of	 head 	 lines 	 	--	you	can	see	that	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	and	 marriage 	 s 	 	are	 start 	 ing 	 	to	shift	.
And	look	at	that	last	 head 	 line 	 	--	young	women	 earn 	 ing 	 	more	than	young	men	.
That	 part 	 icular 	 	 head 	 line 	 	 come 	 s 	 	to	me	from	a	market	research	firm	.
 The 	 y 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	by	one	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 client 	 s 	 	who	was	going	to	buy	 house 	 s 	 	in	that	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	in	the	future	.
And	they	 expect 	 ed 	 	that	it	would	be	young	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	,	or	young	men	,	just	like	it	had	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	.
But	in	fact	,	they	found	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	surprising	.
It	was	young	,	single	women	who	 we 	 re 	 	the	major	 purchase 	 rs 	 	of	 house 	 s 	 	in	the	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	.
And	so	they	 decide 	 d 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 intrigu 	 ed 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	 find 	 ing 	 	,	to	do	a	 nation 	 wide 	 	survey	.
So	they	spread	out	all	the	census	data	,	and	what	they	found	,	the	guy	 de 	 scribed 	 	to	me	 a 	 s 	 	a	 shock 	 er 	 	,	which	is	that	in	1,997	out	of	2,000	 commun 	 ities 	 	,	women	,	young	women	,	 we 	 re 	 	making	more	money	than	young	men	.
So	here	you	have	a	generation	of	young	women	who	grow	up	 think 	 ing 	 	of	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	more	 power 	 ful 	 	 earn 	 ers 	 	than	the	young	men	around	them	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	I	've	just	laid	out	the	picture	for	you	,	but	I	still	have	n't	 explain 	 ed 	 	to	you	why	 th 	 is 	 	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
And	in	a	moment	,	I	'm	going	to	show	you	a	graph	,	and	what	you	'll	see	on	 th 	 is 	 	graph	--	it	 begin 	 s 	 	in	1973	,	just	before	women	start	 flood 	 ing 	 	the	 work 	 force 	 	,	and	it	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	us	up	to	our	current	day	.
And	 bas 	 ically 	 	what	you	'll	see	is	what	 economist 	 s 	 	talk	about	 a 	 s 	 	the	 polar 	 ization 	 	of	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	what	 do 	 es 	 	that	mean	?
It	 mean 	 s 	 	that	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	is	 divid 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 high 	 - 	 skill 	 	,	 high 	 - 	 wage 	 	 job 	 s 	 	and	 low 	 - 	 skill 	 	,	 low 	 - 	 wage 	 	 job 	 s 	 	--	and	that	the	middle	,	the	 middle 	 - 	 skill 	 	 job 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 middle 	 - 	 earn 	 ing 	 	 job 	 s 	 	,	are	 start 	 ing 	 	to	drop	out	of	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	going	on	for	40	 year 	 s 	 	now	.
But	 th 	 is 	 	process	is	 affect 	 ing 	 	men	 ver 	 y 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	than	it	's	 affect 	 ing 	 	women	.
You	'll	see	the	women	in	red	,	and	you	'll	see	the	men	in	blue	.
You	'll	watch	them	both	drop	out	of	the	middle	class	,	but	see	what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	women	and	see	what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	men	.
There	we	go	.
So	watch	that	.	You	see	them	both	drop	out	of	the	middle	class	.
 Wat 	 ch 	 	what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	the	women	.	 Wat 	 ch 	 	what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	the	men	.
The	men	sort	of	 stag 	 n 	 ate 	 	there	,	while	the	women	zoom	up	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 high 	 - 	 skill 	 	 job 	 s 	 	.
So	what	's	that	about	?
It	 look 	 s 	 	like	women	got	some	power	boost	on	a	video	game	,	or	like	they	snuck	in	some	secret	 s 	 er 	 um 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 birth 	 - 	 control 	 	 pill 	 s 	 	that	lets	them	shoot	up	high	.
But	of	course	,	it	's	not	about	that	.
What	it	's	about	is	that	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	a	lot	.
We	used	to	have	a	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	which	was	about	building	 good 	 s 	 	and	 product 	 s 	 	,	and	now	we	have	a	service	 eco 	 nomy 	 	and	an	information	and	creative	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
 T 	 hose 	 	two	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	 requir 	 e 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	different	 skill 	 s 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	it	 happen 	 s 	 	,	women	have	 be 	 en 	 	much	better	at	 acquir 	 ing 	 	the	new	set	of	 skill 	 s 	 	than	men	have	 be 	 en 	 	.
It	used	to	be	that	you	 we 	 re 	 	a	guy	who	went	to	high	school	who	did	n't	have	a	college	degree	,	but	you	had	a	specific	set	of	 skill 	 s 	 	,	and	with	the	help	of	a	 un 	 ion 	 	,	you	could	make	 your 	 self 	 	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	 middle 	 - 	 class 	 	life	.
But	that	 re 	 ally 	 	is	n't	true	 any 	 more 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	new	 eco 	 nomy 	 	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	 in 	 different 	 	to	 s 	 ize 	 	and	strength	,	which	is	what	's	 help 	 ed 	 	men	 a 	 long 	 	all	these	 year 	 s 	 	.
What	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	 requir 	 es 	 	now	is	a	whole	different	set	of	 skill 	 s 	 	.
You	 bas 	 ically 	 	need	 intellig 	 ence 	 	,	you	need	an	ability	to	 s 	 it 	 	still	and	focus	,	to	communicate	 open 	 ly 	 	,	to	be	able	to	listen	to	people	and	to	 oper 	 ate 	 	in	a	 work 	 place 	 	that	is	much	more	fluid	than	it	used	to	be	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	are	 thing 	 s 	 	that	women	do	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	well	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	.
If	you	look	at	management	 theor 	 y 	 	these	 day 	 s 	 	,	it	used	to	be	that	our	ideal	 lead 	 er 	 	 sound 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 Gene 	 ral 	 	 Pat 	 ton 	 	,	right	?
You	would	be	 is 	 suing 	 	 order 	 s 	 	from	above	.
You	would	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 hierarch 	 ical 	 	.
You	would	tell	 every 	 one 	 	 be 	 low 	 	you	what	to	do	.
But	that	's	not	what	an	ideal	 lead 	 er 	 	is	like	now	.
If	you	read	management	 book 	 s 	 	now	,	a	 lead 	 er 	 	is	 some 	 body 	 	who	can	foster	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	,	who	can	get	his	--	get	the	 employ 	 ees 	 	--	see	,	I	still	say	``	his	''	--	who	can	get	the	 employ 	 ees 	 	to	talk	to	each	other	,	who	can	 bas 	 ically 	 	build	 team 	 s 	 	and	get	them	to	be	creative	.
And	 t 	 hose 	 	are	all	 thing 	 s 	 	that	women	do	 ver 	 y 	 	well	.
And	then	on	top	of	that	,	that	's	 create 	 d 	 	a	kind	of	 cascad 	 ing 	 	effect	.
Women	enter	the	 work 	 place 	 	at	the	top	,	and	then	at	the	 work 	 ing 	 	class	,	all	the	new	 job 	 s 	 	that	are	 create 	 d 	 	are	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 job 	 s 	 	that	wives	used	to	do	for	free	at	home	.
So	that	's	 child 	 care 	 	,	elder	care	and	food	 pre 	 par 	 ation 	 	.
So	 t 	 hose 	 	are	all	the	 job 	 s 	 	that	are	growing	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	are	 job 	 s 	 	that	women	tend	to	do	.
 N 	 ow 	 	one	day	it	might	be	that	 mother 	 s 	 	will	hire	an	 out 	 - 	 of 	 - 	 work 	 	,	 middle 	 - 	 aged 	 	,	 form 	 er 	 	 steel 	 work 	 er 	 	guy	to	watch	 the 	 ir 	 	children	at	home	,	and	that	would	be	good	for	the	men	,	but	that	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	yet	.
To	see	what	's	going	to	happen	,	you	ca	n't	just	look	at	the	 work 	 force 	 	that	is	now	,	you	have	to	look	at	our	future	 work 	 force 	 	.
And	here	the	story	is	 fair 	 ly 	 	simple	.
Women	are	 get 	 ting 	 	college	 degree 	 s 	 	at	a	 fast 	 er 	 	rate	than	men	.
Why	?	 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	real	 myster 	 y 	 	.
People	have	 ask 	 ed 	 	men	,	why	do	n't	they	just	go	back	to	college	,	to	community	college	,	say	,	and	 re 	 tool 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	learn	a	new	set	of	 skill 	 s 	 	?
Well	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	they	're	just	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 comfort 	 able 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	that	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	used	to	 think 	 ing 	 	of	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 provide 	 rs 	 	,	and	they	ca	n't	seem	to	build	the	social	 network 	 s 	 	that	allow	them	to	get	through	college	.
So	for	some	reason	men	just	do	n't	end	up	going	back	to	college	.
And	what	's	even	more	 disturb 	 ing 	 	is	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	with	 young 	 er 	 	 boy 	 s 	 	.
There	's	 be 	 en 	 	about	a	decade	of	research	about	what	people	are	 call 	 ing 	 	the	``	boy	crisis	.	''
 N 	 ow 	 	the	boy	crisis	is	 th 	 is 	 	idea	that	 ver 	 y 	 	young	 boy 	 s 	 	,	for	 what 	 ever 	 	reason	,	are	 do 	 ing 	 	 wo 	 rse 	 	in	school	than	 ver 	 y 	 	young	 girl 	 s 	 	,	and	people	have	 the 	 ories 	 	about	that	.
 I 	 s 	 	it	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	an	 excess 	 ively 	 	verbal	curriculum	,	and	little	 girl 	 s 	 	are	better	at	that	than	little	 boy 	 s 	 	?
Or	that	we	 requir 	 e 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	to	 s 	 it 	 	still	too	much	,	and	so	 boy 	 s 	 	 initi 	 ally 	 	feel	like	 failure 	 s 	 	?
And	some	people	say	it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	,	in	9th	grade	,	 boy 	 s 	 	start	dropping	out	of	school	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	I	'm	writing	a	book	about	all	 th 	 is 	 	,	I	'm	still	looking	 in 	 to 	 	it	,	so	I	do	n't	have	the	answer	.
But	in	the	mean	time	,	I	'm	going	to	call	on	the	 world 	 wide 	 	education	expert	,	who	's	my	10-year-old	daughter	,	 No 	 ah 	 	,	to	talk	to	you	about	why	the	 boy 	 s 	 	in	her	class	do	 wo 	 rse 	 	.
 No 	 ah 	 	:	The	 girl 	 s 	 	are	 obvious 	 ly 	 	 smart 	 er 	 	.
I	mean	they	have	much	 large 	 r 	 	 vocabul 	 ary 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	learn	much	 fast 	 er 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	are	more	controlled	.
On	the	board	 to 	 day 	 	for	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	recess	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	,	 on 	 ly 	 	 boy 	 s 	 	.
 Han 	 na 	 	 Ro 	 s 	 in 	 	:	And	why	is	that	?
 No 	 ah 	 	:	Why	?	 The 	 y 	 	 we 	 re 	 	just	not	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	the	class	while	the	 girl 	 s 	 	 s 	 at 	 	there	 ver 	 y 	 	 nice 	 ly 	 	.
HR	:	So	there	you	go	.
 Th 	 is 	 	whole	thesis	 re 	 ally 	 	came	home	to	me	when	I	went	to	visit	a	college	in	 K 	 ansas 	 	City	--	 work 	 ing 	 - 	 class 	 	college	.
 Certain 	 ly 	 	,	when	I	was	in	college	,	I	had	certain	 expect 	 ations 	 	about	my	life	--	that	my	husband	and	I	would	both	work	,	and	that	we	would	 equal 	 ly 	 	raise	the	children	.
But	these	college	 girl 	 s 	 	had	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	view	of	 the 	 ir 	 	future	.
 Bas 	 ically 	 	,	the	way	they	 s 	 aid 	 	it	to	me	is	that	they	would	be	 work 	 ing 	 	18	 hour 	 s 	 	a	day	,	that	 the 	 ir 	 	husband	would	 may 	 be 	 	have	a	job	,	but	that	 most 	 ly 	 	he	would	be	at	home	taking	care	of	the	 kid 	 dies 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	was	kind	of	a	 shock 	 er 	 	to	me	.
And	then	here	's	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	quote	from	one	of	the	 girl 	 s 	 	:	``	Men	are	the	new	ball	and	chain	.	''
 N 	 ow 	 	you	laugh	,	but	that	quote	 ha 	 s 	 	kind	of	a	 s 	 ting 	 	to	it	,	right	?
And	I	think	the	reason	it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 s 	 ting 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	of	 histo 	 ry 	 	do	n't	reverse	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 with 	 out 	 	a	lot	of	pain	,	and	that	's	why	I	talk	about	us	all	going	through	 th 	 is 	 	together	.
The	night	after	I	 talk 	 ed 	 	to	these	college	 girl 	 s 	 	,	I	 al 	 so 	 	went	to	a	men	's	group	in	 K 	 ansas 	 	,	and	these	 we 	 re 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	kind	of	 victim 	 s 	 	of	the	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	which	I	spoke	to	you	about	 ear 	 lier 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	 we 	 re 	 	men	who	had	 be 	 en 	 	 contract 	 ors 	 	,	or	they	had	 be 	 en 	 	building	 house 	 s 	 	and	they	had	lost	 the 	 ir 	 	 job 	 s 	 	after	the	housing	boom	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	group	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 fail 	 ing 	 	to	pay	 the 	 ir 	 	child	support	.
And	the	 instruct 	 or 	 	was	up	there	in	the	class	 explain 	 ing 	 	to	them	all	the	ways	in	which	they	had	lost	 the 	 ir 	 	 ident 	 ity 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	new	age	.
He	was	 tell 	 ing 	 	them	they	no	 long 	 er 	 	had	any	moral	 author 	 ity 	 	,	that	 no 	 body 	 	 need 	 ed 	 	them	for	 emotion 	 al 	 	support	 any 	 more 	 	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	not	 re 	 ally 	 	the	 provide 	 rs 	 	.
So	who	 we 	 re 	 	they	?
And	 th 	 is 	 	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 dis 	 heart 	 en 	 ing 	 	for	them	.
And	what	he	did	was	he	wrote	down	on	the	board	``	$	85,000	,	''	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	That	's	her	 s 	 al 	 ary 	 	,	''	and	then	he	wrote	down	``	$	12,000	.	''
``	That	's	your	 s 	 al 	 ary 	 	.
So	who	's	the	man	now	?	''	he	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	.
``	Who	's	the	damn	man	?
She	's	the	man	now	.	''
And	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 ent 	 	a	shudder	through	the	room	.
And	that	's	part	of	the	reason	I	like	to	talk	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	I	think	it	can	be	 pre 	 tty 	 	 pain 	 ful 	 	,	and	we	 re 	 ally 	 	have	to	work	through	it	.
And	the	other	reason	it	's	kind	of	 urge 	 nt 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	not	just	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	the	 U. 	 S 	 	.
It	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	all	over	the	world	.
In	India	,	poor	women	are	 learn 	 ing 	 	English	 fast 	 er 	 	than	 the 	 ir 	 	male	 counter 	 part 	 s 	 	in	order	to	staff	the	new	call	 center 	 s 	 	that	are	growing	in	India	.
In	China	,	a	lot	of	the	 open 	 ing 	 	up	of	private	 entrepreneur 	 ship 	 	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	women	are	 start 	 ing 	 	 business 	 es 	 	,	small	 business 	 es 	 	,	 fast 	 er 	 	than	men	.
And	here	's	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	which	is	in	South	Korea	.
Over	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 decade 	 s 	 	,	South	Korea	built	one	of	the	most	 patriarch 	 al 	 	 socie 	 ties 	 	we	know	about	.
 The 	 y 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	 enshrin 	 ed 	 	the	 second 	 - 	 class 	 	 stat 	 us 	 	of	women	in	the	civil	code	.
And	if	women	 fail 	 ed 	 	to	birth	male	children	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	 treat 	 ed 	 	like	domestic	 serv 	 ants 	 	.
And	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	family	would	pray	to	the	 spirit 	 s 	 	to	kill	off	a	girl	child	so	they	could	have	a	male	child	.
But	over	the	'70s	and	'80s	,	the	South	Korea	government	 decide 	 d 	 	they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 rapid 	 ly 	 	 industrial 	 ize 	 	,	and	so	what	they	did	was	,	they	 start 	 ed 	 	to	push	women	 in 	 to 	 	the	 work 	 force 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	a	question	since	1985	:	``	How	 strong 	 ly 	 	do	you	prefer	a	 first 	 - 	 born 	 	son	?	''
And	now	look	at	the	chart	.
That	's	from	1985	to	2003	.
How	much	do	you	prefer	a	 first 	 - 	 born 	 	son	?
So	you	can	see	that	these	economic	 change 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	do	have	a	strong	effect	on	our	culture	.
 N 	 ow 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	n't	fully	 process 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	information	,	it	's	kind	of	coming	back	to	us	in	our	pop	culture	in	these	kind	of	weird	and	 exagge 	 rated 	 	ways	,	where	you	can	see	that	the	 stereo 	 type 	 s 	 	are	changing	.
And	so	we	have	on	the	male	side	what	one	of	my	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	 like 	 s 	 	to	call	the	``	 o 	 mega 	 	 male 	 s 	 	''	 pop 	 ping 	 	up	,	who	are	the	 male 	 s 	 	who	are	 romantic 	 ally 	 	 challeng 	 ed 	 	 lose 	 rs 	 	who	ca	n't	find	a	job	.
And	they	come	up	in	 lot 	 s 	 	of	different	 form 	 s 	 	.
So	we	have	the	 perpetu 	 al 	 	adolescent	.
We	have	the	 charm 	 less 	 	 mis 	 anthro 	 pe 	 	.
 Th 	 en 	 	we	have	our	Bud	Light	guy	who	's	the	happy	couch	potato	.
And	then	here	's	a	 shock 	 er 	 	:	even	America	's	most	 s 	 ex 	 iest 	 	man	 al 	 ive 	 	,	the	 s 	 ex 	 iest 	 	man	 al 	 ive 	 	 get 	 s 	 	 romantic 	 ally 	 	 play 	 ed 	 	these	 day 	 s 	 	in	a	movie	.
And	then	on	the	female	side	,	you	have	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	,	in	which	you	have	these	crazy	 super 	 hero 	 	women	.
You	've	got	 Lad 	 y 	 	Gaga	.
You	've	got	our	new	 Jam 	 es 	 	Bond	,	who	's	 Angel 	 ina 	 	 Jo 	 lie 	 	.
And	it	's	not	just	for	the	young	,	right	?
Even	Helen	 Mir 	 ren 	 	can	hold	a	gun	these	 day 	 s 	 	.
And	so	it	 feel 	 s 	 	like	we	have	to	move	from	 th 	 is 	 	place	where	we	've	got	these	 uber 	 - 	 exagge 	 rated 	 	 image 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 feel 	 s 	 	a	little	more	normal	.
So	for	a	long	time	in	the	economic	sphere	,	we	've	lived	with	the	term	``	glass	 ceil 	 ing 	 	.	''
 N 	 ow 	 	I	've	never	 re 	 ally 	 	 like 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	term	.
For	one	thing	,	it	 put 	 s 	 	men	and	women	in	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 ant 	 agon 	 istic 	 	relationship	with	one	 an 	 other 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	men	are	these	 dev 	 ious 	 	 trick 	 sters 	 	up	there	who	've	put	up	 th 	 is 	 	glass	 ceil 	 ing 	 	.
And	we	're	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 low 	 	the	glass	 ceil 	 ing 	 	,	the	women	.
And	we	have	a	lot	of	skill	and	experience	,	but	it	's	a	trick	,	so	how	are	you	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	 prep 	 are 	 	to	get	through	that	glass	 ceil 	 ing 	 	?
And	 al 	 so 	 	,	``	 shatter 	 ing 	 	the	glass	 ceil 	 ing 	 	''	is	a	 terr 	 ible 	 	phrase	.
would	pop	 the 	 ir 	 	head	through	a	glass	 ceil 	 ing 	 	?
So	the	image	that	I	like	to	think	of	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	glass	 ceil 	 ing 	 	,	is	the	high	bridge	.
It	's	 definite 	 ly 	 	 terrify 	 ing 	 	to	stand	at	the	foot	of	a	high	bridge	,	but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	 exhila 	 rating 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 beaut 	 iful 	 	up	there	,	and	you	're	looking	out	on	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	view	.
And	the	great	thing	is	there	's	no	trick	like	with	the	glass	 ceil 	 ing 	 	.
There	's	no	man	or	woman	 stand 	 ing 	 	in	the	middle	about	to	cut	the	 cable 	 s 	 	.
