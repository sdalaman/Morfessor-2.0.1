Shea	 Hem 	 brey 	 	:	How	I	became	100	artists
I	'm	a	contemporary	artist	with	a	bit	of	an	unexpected	background	.
I	was	in	my	20s	before	I	ever	went	to	an	art	museum	.
I	grew	up	in	the	middle	of	nowhere	on	a	dirt	road	in	rural	Arkansas	,	an	hour	from	the	 near 	 est 	 	movie	theater	.
And	I	think	it	was	a	great	place	to	grow	up	as	an	artist	because	I	grew	up	around	 quirk 	 y 	 	,	 color 	 ful 	 	characters	who	were	great	at	making	with	their	hands	.
And	my	childhood	is	more	hick	than	I	could	ever	possibly	relate	to	you	,	and	also	more	intellectual	than	you	would	ever	expect	.
For	instance	,	me	and	my	sister	,	when	we	were	little	,	we	would	compete	to	see	who	could	eat	the	most	squirrel	brains	.
But	on	the	other	side	of	that	,	though	,	we	were	big	readers	in	our	house	.
And	if	the	TV	was	on	,	we	were	watching	a	documentary	.
And	my	dad	is	the	most	 vor 	 acious 	 	reader	I	know	.
He	can	read	a	novel	or	two	a	day	.
But	when	I	was	little	,	I	remember	,	he	would	kill	flies	in	our	house	with	my	BB	gun	.
And	what	was	so	amazing	to	me	about	that	--	well	he	would	be	in	his	 recline 	 r 	 	,	would	holler	for	me	to	fetch	the	BB	gun	,	and	I	'd	go	get	it	.
And	what	was	amazing	to	me	--	well	it	was	pretty	 kick 	 as 	 s 	 	;	he	was	killing	a	fly	in	the	house	with	a	gun	--	but	what	was	so	amazing	to	me	was	that	he	knew	just	enough	how	to	pump	it	.
And	he	could	shoot	it	from	two	rooms	away	and	not	damage	what	it	was	on	because	he	knew	how	to	pump	it	just	enough	to	kill	the	fly	and	not	damage	what	it	 land 	 ed 	 	on	.
So	I	should	talk	about	art	.
Or	we	'll	be	here	all	day	with	my	childhood	stories	.
I	love	contemporary	art	,	but	I	'm	often	 re 	 ally 	 	 frustrat 	 ed 	 	with	the	contemporary	art	world	and	the	contemporary	art	scene	.
A	few	years	ago	,	I	spent	months	in	Europe	to	see	the	major	international	art	exhibitions	that	have	the	pulse	of	what	is	 s 	 upposed 	 	to	be	going	on	in	the	art	world	.
And	I	was	struck	by	going	to	so	many	,	one	after	the	other	,	with	some	clarity	of	what	it	was	that	I	was	 long 	 ing 	 	for	.
And	I	was	 long 	 ing 	 	for	several	things	that	I	was	n't	getting	,	or	not	getting	enough	of	.
But	two	of	the	main	things	:	one	of	it	,	I	was	 long 	 ing 	 	for	more	work	that	was	appealing	to	a	broad	public	,	that	was	accessible	.
And	the	second	thing	that	I	was	 long 	 ing 	 	for	was	some	more	 exquisit 	 e 	 	 craftsman 	 ship 	 	and	technique	.
So	I	started	thinking	and	listing	what	all	it	was	that	I	thought	would	make	a	perfect	biennial	.
So	I	decided	,	I	'm	going	to	start	my	own	biennial	.
I	'm	going	to	organize	it	and	direct	it	and	get	it	going	in	the	world	.
So	I	thought	,	okay	,	I	have	to	have	some	criteria	of	how	to	choose	work	.
So	 a 	 mongst 	 	all	the	criteria	I	have	,	there	's	two	main	things	.
One	of	them	,	I	call	my	 Mi 	 maw 	 	's	Test	.
And	what	that	is	is	I	imagine	 explain 	 ing 	 	a	work	of	art	to	my	grandmother	in	five	minutes	,	and	if	I	ca	n't	explain	it	in	five	minutes	,	then	it	's	too	obtuse	or	esoteric	and	it	has	n't	been	refined	enough	yet	.
It	needs	to	worked	on	until	it	can	speak	 fluent 	 ly 	 	.
And	then	my	other	second	set	of	rules	--	I	hate	to	say	``	rules	''	because	it	's	art	--	my	criteria	would	be	the	three	H	's	,	which	is	head	,	heart	and	hands	.
And	great	art	would	have	``	head	''	:	it	would	have	 interest 	 ing 	 	intellectual	ideas	and	concepts	.
It	would	have	``	heart	''	in	that	it	would	have	passion	and	heart	and	soul	.
And	it	would	have	``	hand	''	in	that	it	would	be	 great 	 ly 	 	crafted	.
So	I	started	thinking	about	how	am	I	going	to	do	this	biennial	,	how	am	I	going	to	travel	the	world	and	find	these	artists	?
And	then	I	 re 	 alized 	 	one	day	,	there	's	an	easier	solution	to	this	.
I	'm	just	going	to	make	the	whole	thing	myself	.
And	so	this	is	what	I	did	.
So	I	thought	,	a	biennial	needs	artists	.
I	'm	going	to	do	an	international	biennial	;	I	need	artists	from	all	around	the	world	.
So	what	I	did	was	I	 invent 	 ed 	 	a	hundred	artists	from	around	the	world	.
I	figured	out	their	bios	,	their	 passion 	 s 	 	in	life	and	their	art	styles	,	and	I	started	making	their	work	.
I	felt	,	oh	this	is	the	kind	of	project	that	I	could	spend	my	whole	life	 do 	 ing 	 	.
So	I	decided	,	I	'm	going	to	make	this	a	real	biennial	.
It	's	going	to	be	two	years	of	studio	work	.
And	I	'm	going	to	create	this	in	two	years	,	and	I	have	.
So	I	should	start	to	talk	about	these	guys	.
Well	the	range	is	quite	a	bit	.
And	I	'm	such	a	technician	,	so	I	loved	this	project	,	getting	to	play	with	all	the	techniques	.
So	for	example	,	in	realist	paintings	,	it	ranges	from	this	,	which	is	kind	of	old	masters	style	,	to	 re 	 ally 	 	realistic	 still 	 - 	 life 	 	,	to	this	type	of	painting	where	I	'm	painting	with	a	single	hair	.
And	then	at	the	other	end	,	there	's	performance	and	short	films	and	indoor	 installation 	 s 	 	like	this	indoor	installation	and	this	one	,	and	outdoor	 installation 	 s 	 	like	this	one	and	this	one	.
I	know	I	should	mention	:	I	'm	making	all	these	things	.
This	is	n't	 Photoshop 	 ped 	 	.
I	'm	under	the	river	with	those	fish	.
So	now	let	me	 introduc 	 e 	 	some	of	my	fictional	artists	to	you	.
This	is	Nell	Remmel	.
Nell	is	interested	in	agricultural	processes	,	and	her	work	is	based	in	these	practices	.
This	piece	,	which	is	called	``	 Flipp 	 ed 	 	Earth	''	--	she	was	interested	in	taking	the	sky	and	 us 	 ing 	 	it	to	cleanse	barren	ground	.
And	by	taking	giant	 mirror 	 s 	 	--	and	here	she	's	taking	giant	 mirror 	 s 	 	and	pulling	them	into	the	dirt	.
And	this	is	22	feet	long	.
And	what	I	loved	about	her	work	is	,	when	I	would	walk	around	it	and	look	down	into	the	sky	,	looking	down	to	watch	the	sky	,	and	it	 un 	 folded 	 	in	a	new	way	.
And	probably	the	best	part	of	this	piece	is	at	dusk	and	dawn	when	the	twilight	wedge	has	fallen	and	the	ground	's	dark	,	but	there	's	still	the	light	above	,	bright	above	.
And	so	you	're	standing	there	and	everything	else	is	dark	,	but	there	's	this	portal	that	you	want	to	jump	in	.
This	piece	was	great	.	This	is	in	my	parents	'	backyard	in	Arkansas	.
And	I	love	to	dig	a	hole	.
So	this	piece	was	great	fun	because	it	was	two	days	of	digging	in	soft	dirt	.
The	next	artist	is	Kay	 Over 	 stry 	 	,	and	she	's	interested	in	 ephemeral 	 ity 	 	and	 trans 	 ience 	 	.
And	in	her	most	recent	project	,	it	's	called	``	Weather	I	Made	.	''
And	she	's	making	weather	on	her	body	's	scale	.
And	this	piece	is	``	Frost	.	''
And	what	she	did	was	she	went	out	on	a	cold	,	dry	night	and	 breath 	 ed 	 	back	and	forth	on	the	lawn	to	leave	--	to	leave	her	life	's	mark	,	the	mark	of	her	life	.
And	so	this	is	 five 	 - 	 foot 	 	,	 five 	 - 	 inches 	 	of	frost	that	she	left	behind	.
The	sun	rises	,	and	it	melts	away	.
And	that	was	played	by	my	mom	.
So	the	next	artist	,	this	is	a	group	of	Japanese	artists	,	a	collective	of	Japanese	artists	--	in	Tokyo	.
And	they	were	interested	in	developing	a	new	,	alternative	art	space	,	and	they	needed	funding	for	it	,	so	they	decided	to	come	up	with	some	 interest 	 ing 	 	 fundrais 	 ing 	 	projects	.
One	of	these	is	 scratch 	 - 	 off 	 	 master 	 pieces 	 	.
And	so	what	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	--	each	of	these	artists	on	a	 nine 	 - 	 by 	 - 	 seven 	 - 	 inch 	 	card	,	which	they	sell	for	10	bucks	,	they	drew	original	works	of	art	.
And	you	buy	one	,	and	maybe	you	get	a	real	piece	,	and	maybe	not	.
Well	this	has	 spark 	 ed 	 	a	craze	in	Japan	,	because	everyone	's	 wan 	 ting 	 	a	 master 	 piece 	 	.
And	the	ones	that	are	the	most	sought	after	are	the	ones	that	are	only	 bare 	 ly 	 	 scratch 	 ed 	 	off	.
And	all	these	works	,	in	some	way	,	talk	about	luck	or	fate	or	chance	.
Those	first	two	are	 portrait 	 s 	 	of	 mega 	 - 	 jack 	 pot 	 	winners	years	before	and	after	their	win	.
And	in	this	one	it	's	called	``	Drawing	the	Short	Stick	.	''
I	love	this	piece	because	I	have	a	little	cousin	at	home	who	introduced	me	--	which	I	think	is	such	a	great	introduction	--	to	a	friend	one	day	as	,	``	This	is	my	cousin	Shea	.
He	draws	sticks	real	good	.	''
Which	is	one	of	the	best	 compliment 	 s 	 	ever	.
This	artist	is	Gus	 Wein 	 mueller 	 	,	and	he	's	 do 	 ing 	 	a	project	,	a	large	project	,	called	``	Art	for	the	Peoples	.	''
And	within	this	project	,	he	's	 do 	 ing 	 	a	 small 	 er 	 	project	called	``	Artists	in	Residence	.	''
And	what	he	does	is	--	he	 spend 	 s 	 	a	week	at	a	time	with	a	family	.
And	he	shows	up	on	their	porch	,	their	 door 	 step 	 	,	with	a	 tooth 	 brush 	 	and	 paja 	 mas 	 	,	and	he	's	ready	to	spend	the	week	with	them	.
And	 us 	 ing 	 	only	what	's	present	,	he	goes	in	and	makes	a	little	 a 	 bode 	 	studio	to	work	out	of	.
And	he	 spend 	 s 	 	that	week	talking	to	the	family	about	what	do	they	think	great	art	is	.
He	has	all	these	 discussion 	 s 	 	with	their	family	,	and	he	digs	through	everything	they	have	,	and	he	finds	materials	to	make	work	.
And	he	makes	a	work	that	answers	what	they	think	great	art	is	.
For	this	family	,	he	made	this	 still 	 - 	 life 	 	painting	.
And	whatever	he	makes	 some 	 how 	 	references	nesting	and	space	and	personal	property	.
This	next	project	,	this	is	by	 Jao 	 chim 	 	 Paris 	 vega 	 	,	and	he	's	interested	in	--	he	 believe 	 s 	 	art	is	everywhere	waiting	--	that	it	just	needs	a	little	bit	of	a	push	to	happen	.
And	he	provides	this	push	by	 harness 	 ing 	 	natural	forces	,	like	in	his	series	where	he	used	rain	to	make	paintings	.
This	project	is	called	``	Love	 Nest 	 s 	 	.	''
What	he	did	was	to	get	wild	birds	to	make	his	art	for	him	.
So	he	put	the	material	in	places	where	the	birds	were	going	to	collect	them	,	and	they	crafted	his	 nest 	 s 	 	for	him	.
And	this	one	's	called	``	 Love 	 lock 	 	's	Nest	.	''
This	one	's	called	``	Mixtape	Love	Song	's	Nest	.	''
And	this	one	's	called	``	 Love 	 making 	 	Nest	.	''
Next	is	Sylvia	Slater	.
Sylvia	's	interested	in	art	training	.
She	's	a	very	serious	Swiss	artist	.
And	she	was	thinking	about	her	friends	and	family	who	work	in	 chaos 	 - 	 ridden 	 	places	and	developing	countries	,	and	she	was	thinking	,	what	can	I	make	that	would	be	of	value	to	them	,	in	case	something	bad	 happen 	 s 	 	and	they	have	to	buy	their	way	across	the	border	or	pay	off	a	 gun 	 man 	 	?
And	so	she	came	up	with	creating	these	 pocket 	 - 	 s 	 ized 	 	 artwork 	 s 	 	that	are	 portrait 	 s 	 	of	the	person	that	would	carry	them	.
And	you	would	carry	this	around	with	you	,	and	if	everything	went	to	hell	,	you	could	make	payments	and	buy	your	life	.
So	this	life	price	is	for	an	irrigation	 non 	 - 	 profit 	 	director	.
So	 hopeful 	 ly 	 	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	you	never	use	it	,	and	it	's	an	heirloom	that	you	pass	down	.
And	she	makes	them	so	they	could	either	be	broken	up	into	payments	,	or	they	could	be	like	these	,	which	are	leaves	that	can	be	payments	.
And	so	they	're	valuable	.	This	is	precious	metals	and	 gem 	 stones 	 	.
And	this	one	had	to	get	broken	up	.
He	had	to	break	off	a	piece	to	get	out	of	Egypt	 recent 	 ly 	 	.
This	is	by	a	duo	,	Michael	 Aber 	 nath 	 y 	 	and	Bud	Holland	.
And	they	're	interested	in	creating	culture	,	just	tradition	.
So	what	they	do	is	they	move	into	an	area	and	try	to	establish	a	new	tradition	in	a	small	geographic	area	.
So	this	is	in	Eastern	Tennessee	,	and	what	they	decided	was	that	we	need	a	positive	tradition	that	goes	with	death	.
So	they	came	up	with	``	dig	 jig 	 s 	 	.	''
And	a	dig	jig	--	a	dig	jig	is	where	,	for	a	milestone	anniversary	or	a	birthday	,	you	gather	all	your	friends	and	family	together	and	you	dance	on	where	you	're	going	to	be	buried	.
And	we	got	a	lot	of	attention	when	we	did	it	.
I	talked	my	family	into	 do 	 ing 	 	this	,	and	they	did	n't	know	what	I	was	 do 	 ing 	 	.
And	I	was	like	,	``	Get	dressed	for	a	funeral	.	We	're	going	to	go	do	some	work	.	''
And	so	we	got	to	the	grave	and	made	this	,	which	was	 h 	 ilarious 	 	--	the	attention	that	we	got	.
So	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	you	dance	on	the	grave	,	and	after	you	've	done	your	dance	,	everyone	 toast 	 s 	 	you	and	 tell 	 s 	 	you	how	great	you	are	.
And	you	in	essence	have	a	funeral	that	you	get	to	be	present	for	.
That	's	my	mom	and	dad	.
This	is	by	Jason	 Bird 	 song 	 	.
He	is	interested	in	how	we	see	as	an	animal	,	how	we	are	interested	in	mimicry	and	 camouflag 	 e 	 	.
You	know	,	we	look	down	a	dark	alley	or	a	jungle	path	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	out	a	face	or	a	creature	.
We	just	have	that	natural	way	of	seeing	.
And	he	plays	with	this	idea	.
And	this	piece	:	those	are	n't	actually	leaves	.
They	're	butterfly	 specimen 	 s 	 	who	have	a	natural	 camouflag 	 e 	 	.
So	he	pairs	these	up	.
There	's	another	pile	of	leaves	.
Those	are	actually	all	real	butterfly	 specimen 	 s 	 	.
And	he	pairs	these	up	with	paintings	.
Like	this	is	a	painting	of	a	snake	in	a	box	.
So	you	open	the	box	and	you	think	,	``	 Who 	 a 	 	,	there	's	a	snake	in	there	.	''
But	it	's	actually	a	painting	.
So	he	makes	these	 interest 	 ing 	 	 conversation 	 s 	 	about	realism	and	mimicry	and	our	drive	to	be	 fool 	 ed 	 	by	great	 camouflag 	 e 	 	.
The	next	artist	is	Hazel	Clausen	.
Hazel	Clausen	is	an	anthropologist	who	took	a	 sabbat 	 ical 	 	and	decided	,	``	You	know	,	I	would	learn	a	lot	about	culture	if	I	created	a	culture	that	does	n't	exist	from	scratch	.	''
So	that	's	what	she	did	.
She	created	the	Swiss	people	named	the	 Uvu 	 lites 	 	,	and	they	have	this	 d 	 istinctive 	 	 yodel 	 ing 	 	song	that	they	use	the	uvula	for	.
And	also	they	reference	how	the	uvula	--	everything	they	say	is	fallen	because	of	the	forbidden	fruit	.
And	that	's	the	symbol	of	their	culture	.
And	this	is	from	a	documentary	called	``	Sexual	 Practice 	 s 	 	and	 Population 	 s 	 	Control	Among	the	 Uvu 	 lites 	 	.	''
This	is	a	typical	 an 	 gora 	 	 embroider 	 y 	 	for	them	.
This	is	one	of	their	founders	,	Gert	Schaeffer	.
And	actually	this	is	my	Aunt	Irene	.
It	was	so	funny	having	a	fake	person	who	was	making	fake	things	.
And	I	crack	up	at	this	piece	,	because	when	I	see	it	I	know	that	's	French	 an 	 gora 	 	and	all	antique	German	 ribbon 	 s 	 	and	wool	that	I	got	in	a	Nebraska	mill	and	carried	around	for	10	years	and	then	antique	Chinese	skirts	.
The	next	is	a	collective	of	artists	called	the	Silver	 Dober 	 mans 	 	,	and	their	motto	is	to	spread	 pragmat 	 ism 	 	one	person	at	a	time	.
And	they	're	 re 	 ally 	 	interested	in	how	 over 	 - 	 coddle 	 d 	 	we	've	become	.
So	this	is	one	of	their	comments	on	how	 over 	 - 	 coddle 	 d 	 	we	've	become	.
And	what	they	've	done	is	they	put	a	warning	sign	on	every	single	barb	on	this	fence	.
And	this	is	called	``	Horse	Sense	Fence	.	''
The	next	artist	is	K.	M.	Yoon	,	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	South	Korean	artist	.
And	he	's	 re 	 working 	 	a	Confucian	art	tradition	of	scholar	stones	.
Next	is	Maynard	 Sip 	 es 	 	.
And	I	love	Maynard	 Sip 	 es 	 	,	but	he	's	off	in	his	own	world	,	and	,	bless	his	heart	,	he	's	so	 para 	 noid 	 	.
Next	is	Roy	 Pen 	 ig 	 	,	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	Kentucky	artist	,	and	he	's	the	 nice 	 st 	 	guy	.
He	even	once	traded	a	work	of	art	for	a	block	of	government	cheese	because	the	person	wanted	it	so	 bad 	 ly 	 	.
Next	is	an	Australian	artist	,	 Jane 	 en 	 	Jackson	,	and	this	is	from	a	project	of	 her 	 s 	 	called	``	What	an	Artwork	Does	When	We	're	Not	 Watch 	 ing 	 	.	''
Next	is	by	a	Lithuanian	fortune	teller	,	Jurgi	 Petr 	 auskas 	 	.
Next	is	Ginger	Cheshire	.
This	is	from	a	short	film	of	 her 	 s 	 	called	``	The	Last	Person	.	''
And	that	's	my	cousin	and	my	sister	's	dog	,	Gabby	.
The	next	,	this	is	by	Sam	Sandy	.
He	's	an	Australian	Aboriginal	elder	,	and	he	's	also	an	artist	.
And	this	is	from	a	large	 travel 	 ing 	 	sculpture	project	that	he	's	 do 	 ing 	 	.
This	is	from	Estelle	 Willough 	 sby 	 	.
She	 heal 	 s 	 	with	color	.
And	she	's	one	of	the	most	prolific	of	all	these	hundred	artists	,	even	though	she	's	going	to	be	90	next	year	.
This	is	by	Z.	Zhou	,	and	he	's	interested	in	stasis	.
Next	is	by	Hilda	Singh	,	and	she	's	 do 	 ing 	 	a	whole	project	called	``	Social	 Outfit 	 s 	 	.	''
Next	is	by	Vera	 Sokolov 	 a 	 	.
And	I	have	to	say	,	Vera	kind	of	 scare 	 s 	 	me	.
You	ca	n't	look	her	directly	in	the	eyes	because	she	's	kind	of	 s 	 cary 	 	.
And	it	's	good	that	she	's	not	real	;	she	'd	be	mad	that	I	said	that	.
And	she	's	an	 opto 	 metrist 	 	in	St.	Petersburg	,	and	she	plays	with	optics	.

Robert	Lang	folds	 way 	 - 	 new 	 	origami
My	talk	is	``	 F 	 lapping 	 	Birds	and	Space	 Telescope 	 s 	 	.	''
And	you	would	think	that	should	have	nothing	to	do	with	one	another	,	but	I	hope	by	the	end	of	these	18	minutes	,	you	'll	see	a	little	bit	of	a	relation	.
It	ties	to	origami	.	So	let	me	start	.
What	is	origami	?
Most	people	think	they	know	what	origami	is	.	It	's	this	:	 f 	 lapping 	 	birds	,	toys	,	 coot 	 ie 	 	catchers	,	that	sort	of	thing	.
And	that	is	what	origami	used	to	be	.
But	it	's	become	something	else	.
It	's	become	an	art	form	,	a	form	of	sculpture	.
The	common	theme	--	what	makes	it	origami	--	is	folding	is	how	we	create	the	form	.
You	know	,	it	's	very	old	.	This	is	a	plate	from	1797	.
It	shows	these	women	playing	with	these	toys	.
If	you	look	close	,	it	's	this	shape	,	called	a	crane	.
Every	Japanese	kid	 learn 	 s 	 	how	to	fold	that	crane	.
So	this	art	has	been	around	for	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	years	,	and	you	would	think	something	that	's	been	around	that	long	--	so	 restrict 	 ive 	 	,	folding	only	--	everything	that	could	be	done	has	been	done	a	long	time	ago	.
And	that	might	have	been	the	case	.
But	in	the	twentieth	century	,	a	Japanese	folder	named	 Yoshi 	 zawa 	 	came	along	,	and	he	created	tens	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	new	designs	.
But	even	more	 important 	 ly 	 	,	he	created	a	language	,	a	way	we	could	communicate	,	a	code	of	dots	,	 dash 	 es 	 	and	arrows	.
 Harken 	 ing 	 	back	to	Susan	 Black 	 more 	 	's	talk	,	we	now	have	a	means	of	 transmitt 	 ing 	 	information	with	 heredi 	 ty 	 	and	selection	,	and	we	know	where	that	leads	.
And	where	it	has	led	in	origami	is	to	things	like	this	.
This	is	an	origami	figure	--	one	sheet	,	no	cuts	,	folding	only	,	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	folds	.
This	,	too	,	is	origami	,	and	this	shows	where	we	've	gone	in	the	modern	world	.
 Natural 	 ism 	 	.	Detail	.
You	can	get	horns	,	 antler 	 s 	 	--	even	,	if	you	look	close	,	cloven	 hoove 	 s 	 	.
And	it	 raise 	 s 	 	a	question	:	what	changed	?
And	what	changed	is	something	you	might	not	have	expected	in	an	art	,	which	is	math	.
That	is	,	people	 a 	 pplied 	 	mathematical	principles	to	the	art	,	to	discover	the	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	laws	.
And	that	leads	to	a	very	powerful	tool	.
The	secret	to	productivity	in	so	many	fields	--	and	in	origami	--	is	letting	dead	people	do	your	work	for	you	.
Because	what	you	can	do	is	take	your	problem	,	and	turn	it	into	a	problem	that	someone	else	has	solved	,	and	use	their	solutions	.
And	I	want	to	tell	you	how	we	did	that	in	origami	.
Origami	 re 	 volves 	 	around	crease	patterns	.
The	crease	pattern	shown	here	is	the	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	blueprint	for	an	origami	figure	.
And	you	ca	n't	just	draw	them	arbitrarily	.
They	have	to	obey	four	simple	laws	.
And	they	're	very	simple	,	easy	to	understand	.
The	first	law	is	 two 	 - 	 color 	 ability 	 	.	You	can	color	any	crease	pattern	with	just	two	colors	without	ever	having	the	same	color	meeting	.
The	 direction 	 s 	 	of	the	folds	at	any	vertex	--	the	number	of	mountain	folds	,	the	number	of	valley	folds	--	always	 differ 	 s 	 	by	two	.	Two	more	or	two	less	.
Nothing	else	.
If	you	look	at	the	angles	around	the	fold	,	you	find	that	if	you	number	the	angles	in	a	circle	,	all	the	 even 	 - 	 numbered 	 	angles	add	up	to	a	straight	line	,	all	the	 odd 	 - 	 numbered 	 	angles	add	up	to	a	straight	line	.
And	if	you	look	at	how	the	layers	stack	,	you	'll	find	that	no	matter	how	you	stack	folds	and	sheets	,	a	sheet	can	never	penetrate	a	fold	.
So	that	's	four	simple	laws	.	That	's	all	you	need	in	origami	.
All	of	origami	comes	from	that	.
And	you	'd	think	,	``	Can	four	simple	laws	give	rise	to	that	kind	of	complexity	?	''
But	 inde 	 ed 	 	,	the	laws	of	quantum	mechanics	can	be	written	down	on	a	 na 	 pkin 	 	,	and	yet	they	govern	all	of	chemistry	,	all	of	life	,	all	of	history	.
If	we	obey	these	laws	,	we	can	do	amazing	things	.
So	in	origami	,	to	obey	these	laws	,	we	can	take	simple	patterns	--	like	this	 repeat 	 ing 	 	pattern	of	folds	,	called	 texture 	 s 	 	--	and	by	itself	it	's	nothing	.
But	if	we	follow	the	laws	of	origami	,	we	can	put	these	patterns	into	another	fold	that	itself	might	be	something	very	,	very	simple	,	but	when	we	put	it	together	,	we	get	something	a	little	different	.
This	fish	,	400	scales	--	again	,	it	is	one	 un 	 cut 	 	square	,	only	folding	.
And	if	you	do	n't	want	to	fold	400	scales	,	you	can	back	off	and	just	do	a	few	things	,	and	add	plates	to	the	back	of	a	turtle	,	or	toes	.
Or	you	can	ramp	up	and	go	up	to	50	stars	on	a	flag	,	with	13	stripes	.
And	if	you	want	to	go	 re 	 ally 	 	crazy	,	1,000	scales	on	a	 rattle 	 snake 	 	.
And	this	guy	's	on	display	 down 	 stairs 	 	,	so	take	a	look	if	you	get	a	chance	.
The	most	powerful	tools	in	origami	have	related	to	how	we	get	parts	of	creatures	.
And	I	can	put	it	in	this	simple	equation	.
We	take	an	idea	,	 combin 	 e 	 	it	with	a	square	,	and	you	get	an	origami	figure	.
What	matters	is	what	we	mean	by	those	symbols	.
And	you	might	say	,	``	Can	you	 re 	 ally 	 	be	that	specific	?
I	mean	,	a	stag	beetle	--	it	's	got	two	points	for	jaws	,	it	's	got	 antenna 	 e 	 	.	Can	you	be	that	specific	in	the	detail	?	''
And	yeah	,	you	 re 	 ally 	 	can	.
So	how	do	we	do	that	?	Well	,	we	break	it	down	into	a	few	 small 	 er 	 	steps	.
So	let	me	stretch	out	that	equation	.
I	start	with	my	idea	.	I	abstract	it	.
What	's	the	most	abstract	form	?	It	's	a	stick	figure	.
And	from	that	stick	figure	,	I	 some 	 how 	 	have	to	get	to	a	folded	shape	that	has	a	part	for	every	bit	of	the	subject	,	a	flap	for	every	leg	.
And	then	once	I	have	that	folded	shape	that	we	call	the	base	,	you	can	make	the	legs	 narrow 	 er 	 	,	you	can	bend	them	,	you	can	turn	it	into	the	finished	shape	.
Now	the	first	step	,	pretty	easy	.
Take	an	idea	,	draw	a	stick	figure	.
The	last	step	is	not	so	hard	,	but	that	middle	step	--	going	from	the	abstract	description	to	the	folded	shape	--	that	's	hard	.
But	that	's	the	place	where	the	mathematical	ideas	can	get	us	over	the	hump	.
And	I	'm	going	to	show	you	all	how	to	do	that	so	you	can	go	out	of	here	and	fold	something	.
But	we	're	going	to	start	small	.
This	base	has	a	lot	of	flaps	in	it	.
We	're	going	to	learn	how	to	make	one	flap	.
How	would	you	make	a	single	flap	?
Take	a	square	.	Fold	it	in	half	,	fold	it	in	half	,	fold	it	again	,	until	it	 get 	 s 	 	long	and	narrow	,	and	then	we	'll	say	at	the	end	of	that	,	that	's	a	flap	.
I	could	use	that	for	a	leg	,	an	arm	,	anything	like	that	.
What	paper	went	into	that	flap	?
Well	,	if	I	unfold	it	and	go	back	to	the	crease	pattern	,	you	can	see	that	the	upper	left	corner	of	that	shape	is	the	paper	that	went	into	the	flap	.
So	that	's	the	flap	,	and	all	the	rest	of	the	paper	's	left	over	.
I	can	use	it	for	something	else	.
Well	,	there	are	other	ways	of	making	a	flap	.
There	are	other	dimensions	for	flaps	.
If	I	make	the	flaps	 skin 	 nier 	 	,	I	can	use	a	bit	less	paper	.
If	I	make	the	flap	as	skinny	as	possible	,	I	get	to	the	limit	of	the	minimum	amount	of	paper	needed	.
And	you	can	see	there	,	it	needs	a	 quarter 	 - 	 circle 	 	of	paper	to	make	a	flap	.
There	's	other	ways	of	making	flaps	.
If	I	put	the	flap	on	the	edge	,	it	uses	a	half	circle	of	paper	.
And	if	I	make	the	flap	from	the	middle	,	it	uses	a	full	circle	.
So	,	no	matter	how	I	make	a	flap	,	it	needs	some	part	of	a	circular	region	of	paper	.
So	now	we	're	ready	to	scale	up	.
What	if	I	want	to	make	something	that	has	a	lot	of	flaps	?
What	do	I	need	?	I	need	a	lot	of	circles	.
And	in	the	1990s	,	origami	artists	discovered	these	principles	and	 re 	 alized 	 	we	could	make	arbitrarily	complicated	figures	just	by	packing	circles	.
And	here	's	where	the	dead	people	start	to	help	us	out	,	because	lots	of	people	have	studied	the	problem	of	packing	circles	.
I	can	 re 	 ly 	 	on	that	vast	history	of	 mathematician 	 s 	 	and	artists	looking	at	disc	 packing 	 s 	 	and	arrangements	.
And	I	can	use	those	patterns	now	to	create	origami	shapes	.
So	we	figured	out	these	rules	 where 	 by 	 	you	pack	circles	,	you	decorate	the	patterns	of	circles	with	lines	according	to	more	rules	.	That	gives	you	the	folds	.
Those	folds	fold	into	a	base	.	You	shape	the	base	.
You	get	a	folded	shape	--	in	this	case	,	a	cockroach	.
And	it	's	so	simple	.
It	's	so	simple	that	a	computer	could	do	it	.
And	you	say	,	``	Well	,	you	know	,	how	simple	is	that	?	''
But	computers	--	you	need	to	be	able	to	describe	things	in	very	basic	terms	,	and	with	this	,	we	could	.
So	I	wrote	a	computer	program	a	bunch	of	years	ago	called	 Tree 	 Maker 	 	,	and	you	can	download	it	from	my	website	.
It	's	free	.	It	runs	on	all	the	major	platforms	--	even	Windows	.
And	you	just	draw	a	stick	figure	,	and	it	 calculate 	 s 	 	the	crease	pattern	.
It	does	the	circle	packing	,	 calculate 	 s 	 	the	crease	pattern	,	and	if	you	use	that	stick	figure	that	I	just	 show 	 ed 	 	--	which	you	can	kind	of	tell	,	it	's	a	deer	,	it	's	got	 antler 	 s 	 	--	you	'll	get	this	crease	pattern	.
And	if	you	take	this	crease	pattern	,	you	fold	on	the	dotted	lines	,	you	'll	get	a	base	that	you	can	then	shape	into	a	deer	,	with	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	crease	pattern	that	you	wanted	.
And	if	you	want	a	different	deer	,	not	a	 white 	 - 	 tailed 	 	deer	,	but	you	want	a	mule	deer	,	or	an	elk	,	you	change	the	packing	,	and	you	can	do	an	elk	.
Or	you	could	do	a	moose	.
Or	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	any	other	kind	of	deer	.
These	techniques	 revolution 	 ized 	 	this	art	.
We	found	we	could	do	 insect 	 s 	 	,	spiders	,	which	are	close	,	things	with	legs	,	things	with	legs	and	wings	,	things	with	legs	and	 antenna 	 e 	 	.
And	if	folding	a	single	praying	mantis	from	a	single	 un 	 cut 	 	square	was	n't	 interest 	 ing 	 	enough	,	then	you	could	do	two	praying	 mantis 	 es 	 	from	a	single	 un 	 cut 	 	square	.
She	's	eating	him	.
I	call	it	``	Snack	Time	.	''
And	you	can	do	more	than	just	 insect 	 s 	 	.
This	--	you	can	put	details	,	toes	and	claws	.	A	 grizz 	 ly 	 	bear	has	claws	.
This	tree	frog	has	toes	.
Actually	,	lots	of	people	in	origami	now	put	toes	into	their	models	.
Toes	have	become	an	origami	meme	,	because	everyone	's	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
You	can	make	multiple	subjects	.
So	these	are	a	couple	of	 instrumental 	 ists 	 	.
The	guitar	player	from	a	single	square	,	the	bass	player	from	a	single	square	.
And	if	you	say	,	``	Well	,	but	the	guitar	,	bass	--	that	's	not	so	hot	.
Do	a	little	more	complicated	instrument	.	''
Well	,	then	you	could	do	an	organ	.
And	what	this	has	allowed	is	the	creation	of	 origami 	 - 	 on 	 - 	 demand 	 	.
So	now	people	can	say	,	``	I	want	 exact 	 ly 	 	this	and	this	and	this	,	''	and	you	can	go	out	and	fold	it	.
And	sometimes	you	create	high	art	,	and	sometimes	you	pay	the	bills	by	 do 	 ing 	 	some	commercial	work	.
But	I	want	to	show	you	some	examples	.
Everything	you	'll	see	here	,	except	the	car	,	is	origami	.
Just	to	show	you	,	this	 re 	 ally 	 	was	folded	paper	.
 Computer 	 s 	 	made	things	move	,	but	these	were	all	real	,	folded	objects	that	we	made	.
And	we	can	use	this	not	just	for	 visual 	 s 	 	,	but	it	turns	out	to	be	useful	even	in	the	real	world	.
 S 	 urprisingly 	 	,	origami	and	the	structures	that	we	've	developed	in	origami	turn	out	to	have	applications	in	medicine	,	in	science	,	in	space	,	in	the	body	,	consumer	electronics	and	more	.
And	I	want	to	show	you	some	of	these	examples	.
One	of	the	 earl 	 iest 	 	was	this	pattern	,	this	folded	pattern	,	studied	by	 Kory 	 o 	 	Miura	,	a	Japanese	engineer	.
He	studied	a	folding	pattern	,	and	 re 	 alized 	 	this	could	fold	down	into	an	 extreme 	 ly 	 	compact	package	that	had	a	very	simple	opening	and	closing	structure	.
And	he	used	it	to	design	this	solar	array	.
It	's	an	artist	's	rendition	,	but	it	flew	in	a	Japanese	telescope	in	1995	.
Now	,	there	is	actually	a	little	origami	in	the	James	Webb	Space	Telescope	,	but	it	's	very	simple	.
The	telescope	,	going	up	in	space	,	it	 unfold 	 s 	 	in	two	places	.
It	folds	in	 third 	 s 	 	.	It	's	a	very	simple	pattern	--	you	would	n't	even	call	that	origami	.
They	 certain 	 ly 	 	did	n't	need	to	talk	to	origami	artists	.
But	if	you	want	to	go	higher	and	go	larger	than	this	,	then	you	might	need	some	origami	.
Engineers	at	Lawrence	 Liver 	 more 	 	National	Lab	had	an	idea	for	a	telescope	much	larger	.
They	called	it	the	 Eye 	 glass 	 	.
The	design	called	for	 geo 	 synchronous 	 	orbit	25,000	miles	up	,	100-meter	diameter	lens	.
So	,	imagine	a	lens	the	size	of	a	football	field	.
There	were	two	groups	of	people	who	were	interested	in	this	:	planetary	scientists	,	who	want	to	look	up	,	and	then	other	people	,	who	wanted	to	look	down	.
Whether	you	look	up	or	look	down	,	how	do	you	get	it	up	in	space	?	You	've	got	to	get	it	up	there	in	a	rocket	.
And	rockets	are	small	.	So	you	have	to	make	it	 small 	 er 	 	.
How	do	you	make	a	large	sheet	of	glass	 small 	 er 	 	?
Well	,	about	the	only	way	is	to	fold	it	up	 some 	 how 	 	.
So	you	have	to	do	something	like	this	.
This	was	a	small	model	.
 Fold 	 ed 	 	lens	,	you	divide	up	the	panels	,	you	add	 flexure 	 s 	 	.
But	this	pattern	's	not	going	to	work	to	get	something	100	meters	down	to	a	few	meters	.
So	the	 Liver 	 more 	 	 engineer 	 s 	 	,	 wan 	 ting 	 	to	make	use	of	the	work	of	dead	people	,	or	 perhap 	 s 	 	live	 origami 	 sts 	 	,	said	,	``	Let	's	see	if	someone	else	is	 do 	 ing 	 	this	sort	of	thing	.	''
So	they	looked	into	the	origami	community	,	we	got	in	touch	with	them	,	and	I	started	working	with	them	.
And	we	developed	a	pattern	together	that	scales	to	arbitrarily	large	size	,	but	that	 allow 	 s 	 	any	flat	ring	or	disc	to	fold	down	into	a	very	neat	,	compact	cylinder	.
And	they	adopted	that	for	their	first	generation	,	which	was	not	100	meters	--	it	was	a	 five 	 - 	 meter 	 	.
But	this	is	a	 five 	 - 	 meter 	 	telescope	--	has	about	a	 quarter 	 - 	 mile 	 	focal	length	.
And	it	works	 perfect 	 ly 	 	on	its	test	range	,	and	it	 inde 	 ed 	 	folds	up	into	a	neat	little	bundle	.
Now	,	there	is	other	origami	in	space	.
Japan	Aerospace	[	Exploration	]	Agency	flew	a	solar	sail	,	and	you	can	see	here	that	the	sail	 expand 	 s 	 	out	,	and	you	can	still	see	the	fold	lines	.
The	problem	that	's	being	solved	here	is	something	that	needs	to	be	big	and	 sheet 	 - 	 like 	 	at	its	destination	,	but	needs	to	be	small	for	the	journey	.
And	that	works	whether	you	're	going	into	space	,	or	whether	you	're	just	going	into	a	body	.
And	this	example	is	the	latter	.
This	is	a	heart	 s 	 tent 	 	developed	by	Zhong	You	at	Oxford	University	.
It	holds	open	a	blocked	 art 	 ery 	 	when	it	 get 	 s 	 	to	its	destination	,	but	it	needs	to	be	much	 small 	 er 	 	for	the	trip	there	,	through	your	blood	vessels	.
And	this	 s 	 tent 	 	folds	down	 us 	 ing 	 	an	origami	pattern	,	based	on	a	model	called	the	water	bomb	base	.
 Air 	 bag 	 	 designer 	 s 	 	also	have	the	problem	of	getting	flat	sheets	into	a	small	space	.
And	they	want	to	do	their	design	by	simulation	.
So	they	need	to	figure	out	how	,	in	a	computer	,	to	flatten	an	airbag	.
And	the	 algorithm 	 s 	 	that	we	developed	to	do	 insect 	 s 	 	turned	out	to	be	the	solution	for	 airbag 	 s 	 	to	do	their	simulation	.
And	so	they	can	do	a	simulation	like	this	.
Those	are	the	origami	 crease 	 s 	 	forming	,	and	now	you	can	see	the	airbag	inflate	and	find	out	,	does	it	work	?
And	that	leads	to	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	idea	.
You	know	,	where	did	these	things	come	from	?
Well	,	the	heart	 s 	 tent 	 	came	from	that	little	 blow 	 - 	 up 	 	box	that	you	might	have	learned	in	elementary	school	.
It	's	the	same	pattern	,	called	the	water	bomb	base	.
The	 airbag 	 - 	 flatten 	 ing 	 	algorithm	came	from	all	the	 development 	 s 	 	of	circle	packing	and	the	mathematical	theory	that	was	 re 	 ally 	 	developed	just	to	create	 insect 	 s 	 	--	things	with	legs	.
The	thing	is	,	that	this	often	 happen 	 s 	 	in	math	and	science	.
When	you	get	math	involved	,	problems	that	you	solve	for	aesthetic	value	only	,	or	to	create	something	beautiful	,	turn	around	and	turn	out	to	have	an	application	in	the	real	world	.
And	as	weird	and	 surpris 	 ing 	 	as	it	may	sound	,	origami	may	 some 	 day 	 	even	save	a	life	.
Thanks	.

There	's	a	tight	and	 surpris 	 ing 	 	link	between	the	ocean	's	health	and	ours	,	says	marine	biologist	Stephen	Palumbi	.	He	shows	how	toxins	at	the	bottom	of	the	ocean	food	chain	find	their	way	into	our	bodies	,	with	a	 shock 	 ing 	 	story	of	toxic	contamination	from	a	Japanese	fish	market	.

Stephen	Palumbi	:	Following	the	mercury	trail
It	can	be	a	very	complicated	thing	,	the	ocean	.
And	it	can	be	a	very	complicated	thing	,	what	human	health	is	.
And	bringing	those	two	together	might	seem	a	very	 daunt 	 ing 	 	task	,	but	what	I	'm	going	to	try	to	say	is	that	even	in	that	complexity	,	there	's	some	simple	themes	that	I	think	,	if	we	understand	,	we	can	 re 	 ally 	 	move	forward	.
And	those	simple	themes	are	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	themes	about	the	complex	science	of	what	's	going	on	,	but	things	that	we	all	pretty	well	know	.
And	I	'm	going	to	start	with	this	one	:	If	momma	ai	n't	happy	,	ai	n't	nobody	happy	.
We	know	that	,	right	?	We	've	 experience 	 d 	 	that	.
And	if	we	just	take	that	and	we	build	from	there	,	then	we	can	go	to	the	next	step	,	which	is	that	if	the	ocean	ai	n't	happy	,	ai	n't	nobody	happy	.
That	's	the	theme	of	my	talk	.
And	we	're	making	the	ocean	pretty	 un 	 happy 	 	in	a	lot	of	different	ways	.
This	is	a	shot	of	 Canner 	 y 	 	Row	in	1932	.
 Canner 	 y 	 	Row	,	at	the	time	,	had	the	biggest	industrial	canning	operation	on	the	west	coast	.
We	 pil 	 ed 	 	 e 	 normous 	 	 amount 	 s 	 	of	pollution	into	the	air	and	into	the	water	.
Rolf	Bolin	,	who	was	a	professor	at	the	 Hop 	 kin 	 	's	Marine	Station	where	I	work	,	wrote	in	the	1940s	that	``	The	 fume 	 s 	 	from	the	scum	floating	on	the	 in 	 lets 	 	of	the	bay	were	so	bad	they	turned	 lead 	 - 	 based 	 	 paint 	 s 	 	black	.	''
People	working	in	these	 cann 	 eries 	 	could	 bare 	 ly 	 	stay	there	all	day	because	of	the	smell	,	but	you	know	what	they	came	out	saying	?
They	say	,	``	You	know	what	you	smell	?
You	smell	money	.	''
That	pollution	was	money	to	that	community	,	and	those	people	dealt	with	the	pollution	and	 absorb 	 ed 	 	it	into	their	skin	and	into	their	bodies	because	they	needed	the	money	.
We	made	the	ocean	 un 	 happy 	 	;	we	made	people	very	 un 	 happy 	 	,	and	we	made	them	 un 	 healthy 	 	.
The	connection	between	ocean	health	and	human	health	is	actually	based	upon	another	couple	simple	 ada 	 ges 	 	,	and	I	want	to	call	that	``	pinch	a	minnow	,	hurt	a	whale	.	''
The	pyramid	of	ocean	life	...
Now	,	when	an	ecologist	looks	at	the	ocean	--	I	have	to	tell	you	--	we	look	at	the	ocean	in	a	very	different	way	,	and	we	see	different	things	than	when	a	regular	person	looks	at	the	ocean	because	when	an	ecologist	looks	at	the	ocean	,	we	see	all	those	 inter 	 connections 	 	.
We	see	the	base	of	the	food	chain	,	the	plankton	,	the	small	things	,	and	we	see	how	those	animals	are	food	to	animals	in	the	middle	of	the	pyramid	,	and	on	so	up	this	diagram	.
And	that	flow	,	that	flow	of	life	,	from	the	very	base	up	to	the	very	top	,	is	the	flow	that	 ecologist 	 s 	 	see	.
And	that	's	what	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	preserve	when	we	say	,	``	Save	the	ocean	.	Heal	the	ocean	.	''
It	's	that	pyramid	.
Now	why	does	that	matter	for	human	health	?
Because	when	we	jam	things	in	the	bottom	of	that	pyramid	that	should	n't	be	there	,	some	very	 frighten 	 ing 	 	things	happen	.
 Pollut 	 ants 	 	,	some	 pollutant 	 s 	 	have	been	created	by	us	:	molecules	like	 PCB 	 s 	 	that	ca	n't	be	broken	down	by	our	bodies	.
And	they	go	in	the	base	of	that	pyramid	,	and	they	drift	up	;	they	're	passed	up	that	way	,	on	to	 predator 	 s 	 	and	on	to	the	top	 predator 	 s 	 	,	and	in	so	 do 	 ing 	 	,	they	accumulate	.
Now	,	to	bring	that	home	,	I	thought	I	'd	invent	a	little	game	.
We	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	have	to	play	it	;	we	can	just	think	about	it	here	.
It	's	the	Styrofoam	and	chocolate	game	.
Imagine	that	when	we	got	on	this	boat	,	we	were	all	given	two	Styrofoam	 peanut 	 s 	 	.
Ca	n't	do	much	with	them	:	Put	them	in	your	pocket	.
Suppose	the	rules	are	:	every	time	you	offer	 some 	 body 	 	a	drink	,	you	give	them	the	drink	,	and	you	give	them	your	Styrofoam	 peanut 	 s 	 	too	.
What	'll	happen	is	that	the	Styrofoam	 peanut 	 s 	 	will	start	moving	through	our	society	here	,	and	they	will	accumulate	in	the	 drunk 	 est 	 	,	 sting 	 iest 	 	people	.
There	's	no	mechanism	in	this	game	for	them	to	go	anywhere	but	into	a	 bigg 	 er 	 	and	 bigg 	 er 	 	pile	of	 in 	 digestible 	 	Styrofoam	 peanut 	 s 	 	.
And	that	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	 happen 	 s 	 	with	 PDB 	 s 	 	in	this	food	pyramid	:	They	accumulate	into	the	top	of	it	.
Now	suppose	,	instead	of	Styrofoam	 peanut 	 s 	 	,	we	take	these	 love 	 ly 	 	little	 chocolate 	 s 	 	that	we	get	and	we	had	those	instead	.
Well	,	some	of	us	would	be	eating	those	 chocolate 	 s 	 	instead	of	passing	them	around	,	and	instead	of	accumulating	,	they	will	just	pass	into	our	group	here	and	not	accumulate	in	any	one	group	because	they	're	 absorb 	 ed 	 	by	us	.
And	that	's	the	difference	between	a	PCB	and	,	say	,	something	natural	like	an	 omega 	 - 	 3 	 	,	something	we	want	out	of	the	marine	food	chain	.
 PCB 	 s 	 	accumulate	.
We	have	great	examples	of	that	,	 unfortunat 	 ely 	 	.
 PCB 	 s 	 	accumulate	in	 dolphin 	 s 	 	in	Sarasota	Bay	,	in	Texas	,	in	North	Carolina	.
They	get	into	the	food	chain	.
The	 dolphin 	 s 	 	eat	the	fish	that	have	 PCB 	 s 	 	from	the	plankton	,	and	those	 PCB 	 s 	 	,	being	 fat 	 - 	 soluble 	 	,	accumulate	in	these	 dolphin 	 s 	 	.
Now	,	a	dolphin	,	mother	dolphin	,	any	dolphin	--	there	's	only	one	way	that	a	PCB	can	get	out	of	a	dolphin	.
And	what	's	that	?
In	mother	's	milk	.
Here	's	a	diagram	of	the	PCB	load	of	 dolphin 	 s 	 	in	Sarasota	Bay	.
Adult	males	:	a	huge	load	.
 Juvenile 	 s 	 	:	a	huge	load	.
 Female 	 s 	 	after	their	first	calf	is	already	 wean 	 ed 	 	:	a	lower	load	.
Those	females	,	they	're	not	 try 	 ing 	 	to	.
Those	females	are	passing	the	 PCB 	 s 	 	in	the	fat	of	their	own	mother	's	milk	into	their	offspring	,	and	their	offspring	do	n't	survive	.
The	death	rate	in	these	 dolphin 	 s 	 	,	for	the	first	calf	born	of	every	female	dolphin	,	is	60	to	80	percent	.
These	mothers	pump	their	first	offspring	full	of	this	pollutant	,	and	most	of	them	die	.
Now	,	the	mother	then	can	go	and	 reproduc 	 e 	 	,	but	what	a	terrible	price	to	pay	for	the	accumulation	of	this	pollutant	in	these	animals	--	the	death	of	the	 first 	 - 	 born 	 	calf	.
There	's	another	top	predator	in	the	ocean	,	it	turns	out	.
That	top	predator	,	of	course	,	is	us	.
And	we	also	are	eating	meat	that	comes	from	some	of	these	same	places	.
This	is	whale	meat	that	I	photographed	in	a	grocery	store	in	Tokyo	--	or	is	it	?
In	fact	,	what	we	did	a	few	years	ago	was	learn	how	to	 s 	 muggle 	 	a	molecular	biology	lab	into	Tokyo	and	use	it	to	genetically	test	the	DNA	out	of	whale	meat	samples	and	identify	what	they	 re 	 ally 	 	were	.
And	some	of	those	whale	meat	samples	were	whale	meat	.
Some	of	them	were	illegal	whale	meat	,	by	the	way	.
That	's	another	story	.
But	some	of	them	were	not	whale	meat	at	all	.
Even	though	they	were	labeled	whale	meat	,	they	were	dolphin	meat	.
Some	of	them	were	dolphin	liver	.	Some	of	them	were	dolphin	blubber	.
And	those	dolphin	parts	had	a	huge	load	of	 PCB 	 s 	 	,	 dioxin 	 s 	 	and	heavy	metals	.
And	that	huge	load	was	passing	into	the	people	that	ate	this	meat	.
It	turns	out	that	a	lot	of	 dolphin 	 s 	 	are	being	sold	as	meat	in	the	whale	meat	market	around	the	world	.
That	's	a	tragedy	for	those	 population 	 s 	 	,	but	it	's	also	a	tragedy	for	the	people	eating	them	because	they	do	n't	know	that	that	's	toxic	meat	.
We	had	these	data	a	few	years	ago	.
I	remember	sitting	at	my	desk	being	about	the	only	person	in	the	world	who	knew	that	whale	meat	being	sold	in	these	markets	was	 re 	 ally 	 	dolphin	meat	,	and	it	was	toxic	.
It	had	 two 	 - 	 to 	 - 	 three 	 - 	 to 	 - 	 400 	 	times	the	toxic	loads	ever	allowed	by	the	EPA	.
And	I	remember	there	sitting	at	my	desk	thinking	,	``	Well	,	I	know	this	.	This	is	a	great	scientific	discovery	,	''	but	it	was	so	awful	.
And	for	the	very	first	time	in	my	scientific	career	,	I	broke	scientific	protocol	,	which	is	that	you	take	the	data	and	publish	them	in	scientific	journals	and	then	begin	to	talk	about	them	.
We	sent	a	very	polite	letter	to	the	Minister	of	Health	in	Japan	and	simply	pointed	out	that	this	is	an	 in 	 tolerable 	 	situation	,	not	for	us	,	but	for	the	people	of	Japan	because	mothers	who	may	be	 breastfeed 	 ing 	 	,	who	may	have	young	children	,	would	be	buying	something	that	they	thought	was	healthy	,	but	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	toxic	.
That	led	to	a	whole	series	of	other	campaigns	in	Japan	,	and	I	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	proud	to	say	that	at	this	point	,	it	's	very	difficult	to	buy	anything	in	Japan	that	's	labeled	 incorrect 	 ly 	 	,	even	though	they	're	still	selling	whale	meat	,	which	I	believe	they	should	n't	.
But	at	least	it	's	labeled	 correct 	 ly 	 	,	and	you	're	no	 long 	 er 	 	going	to	be	buying	toxic	dolphin	meat	instead	.
It	is	n't	just	there	that	this	 happen 	 s 	 	,	but	in	a	natural	diet	of	some	communities	in	the	Canadian	arctic	and	in	the	United	States	and	in	the	European	arctic	,	a	natural	diet	of	 seal 	 s 	 	and	whales	leads	to	an	accumulation	of	 PCB 	 s 	 	that	have	gathered	up	from	all	parts	of	the	world	and	ended	up	in	these	women	.
These	women	have	toxic	breast	milk	.
They	can	not	feed	their	offspring	,	their	children	,	their	breast	milk	because	of	the	accumulation	of	these	toxins	in	their	food	chain	,	in	their	part	of	the	world	's	ocean	pyramid	.
That	means	their	immune	systems	are	compromised	.
It	means	that	their	children	's	development	can	be	compromised	.
And	the	world	's	attention	on	this	over	the	last	decade	has	reduced	the	problem	for	these	women	,	not	by	changing	the	pyramid	,	but	by	changing	what	they	 particular 	 ly 	 	eat	out	of	it	.
We	've	taken	them	out	of	their	natural	pyramid	in	order	to	solve	this	problem	.
That	's	a	good	thing	for	this	particular	acute	problem	,	but	it	does	nothing	to	solve	the	pyramid	problem	.
There	's	other	ways	of	breaking	the	pyramid	.
The	pyramid	,	if	we	jam	things	in	the	bottom	,	can	get	backed	up	like	a	sewer	line	that	's	 c 	 logged 	 	.
And	if	we	jam	 nutrient 	 s 	 	,	sewage	,	fertilizer	in	the	base	of	that	food	pyramid	,	it	can	back	up	all	through	it	.
We	end	up	with	things	we	've	heard	about	before	:	red	tides	,	for	example	,	which	are	 bloom 	 s 	 	of	toxic	algae	floating	through	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	 caus 	 ing 	 	 neuro 	 logical 	 	damage	.
We	can	also	see	 bloom 	 s 	 	of	bacteria	,	 bloom 	 s 	 	of	viruses	in	the	ocean	.
These	are	two	shots	of	a	red	tide	coming	on	shore	here	and	a	bacteria	in	the	genus	vibrio	,	which	includes	the	genus	that	has	 chole 	 ra 	 	in	it	.
How	many	people	have	seen	a	``	beach	closed	''	sign	?
Why	does	that	happen	?
It	 happen 	 s 	 	because	we	have	 jam 	 med 	 	so	much	into	the	base	of	the	natural	ocean	pyramid	that	these	bacteria	clog	it	up	and	 over 	 fill 	 	onto	our	beaches	.
Often	what	jams	us	up	is	sewage	.
Now	how	many	of	you	have	ever	gone	to	a	state	park	or	a	national	park	where	you	had	a	big	sign	at	the	front	saying	,	``	Closed	because	human	sewage	is	so	far	over	this	park	that	you	ca	n't	use	it	''	?
Not	very	often	.	We	would	n't	tolerate	that	.
We	would	n't	tolerate	our	parks	being	 swamp 	 ed 	 	by	human	sewage	,	but	beaches	are	closed	a	lot	in	our	country	.
They	're	closed	more	and	more	and	more	all	around	the	world	for	the	same	reason	,	and	I	believe	we	should	n't	tolerate	that	either	.
It	's	not	just	a	question	of	 clean 	 liness 	 	;	it	's	also	a	question	of	how	those	organisms	then	turn	into	human	disease	.
These	 vibrio 	 s 	 	,	these	bacteria	,	can	actually	infect	people	.
They	can	go	into	your	skin	and	create	skin	 infection 	 s 	 	.
This	is	a	graph	from	NOAA	's	ocean	and	human	health	initiative	,	showing	the	rise	of	the	 infection 	 s 	 	by	vibrio	in	people	over	the	last	few	years	.
 Surfer 	 s 	 	,	for	example	,	know	this	 incredibl 	 y 	 	.
And	if	you	can	see	on	some	surfing	sites	,	in	fact	,	not	only	do	you	see	what	the	waves	are	like	or	what	the	weather	's	like	,	but	on	some	surf	rider	sites	,	you	see	a	little	 flash 	 ing 	 	poo	alert	.
That	means	that	the	beach	might	have	great	waves	,	but	it	's	a	dangerous	place	for	surfers	to	be	because	they	can	carry	with	them	,	even	after	a	great	day	of	surfing	,	this	legacy	of	an	infection	that	might	take	a	very	long	time	to	solve	.
Some	of	these	 infection 	 s 	 	are	actually	carrying	antibiotic	resistance	genes	now	,	and	that	makes	them	even	more	difficult	.
These	same	 infection 	 s 	 	create	harmful	algal	 bloom 	 s 	 	.
Those	 bloom 	 s 	 	are	generating	other	 kind 	 s 	 	of	chemicals	.
This	is	just	a	simple	list	of	some	of	the	types	of	 poison 	 s 	 	that	come	out	of	these	harmful	algal	 bloom 	 s 	 	:	shellfish	poisoning	,	fish	 ciguat 	 era 	 	,	diarrheic	shellfish	poisoning	--	you	do	n't	want	to	know	about	that	--	neurotoxic	shellfish	poisoning	,	paralytic	shellfish	poisoning	.
These	are	things	that	are	getting	into	our	food	chain	because	of	these	 bloom 	 s 	 	.
Rita	 Cal 	 well 	 	very	 famous 	 ly 	 	traced	a	very	 interest 	 ing 	 	story	of	 chole 	 ra 	 	into	human	communities	,	brought	there	,	not	by	a	normal	human	vector	,	but	by	a	marine	vector	,	this	copepod	.
 Copepod 	 s 	 	are	small	 crustacea 	 ns 	 	.
They	're	a	tiny	fraction	of	an	inch	long	,	and	they	can	carry	on	their	little	legs	some	of	the	 chole 	 ra 	 	bacteria	that	then	leads	to	human	disease	.
That	has	 spark 	 ed 	 	 chole 	 ra 	 	 epidemic 	 s 	 	in	ports	along	the	world	and	has	led	to	increased	concentration	on	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	sure	shipping	does	n't	move	these	vectors	of	 chole 	 ra 	 	around	the	world	.
So	what	do	you	do	?
We	have	major	problems	in	 disrupt 	 ed 	 	ecosystem	flow	that	the	pyramid	may	not	be	working	so	well	,	that	the	flow	from	the	base	up	into	it	is	being	blocked	and	 c 	 logged 	 	.
What	do	you	do	when	you	have	this	sort	of	 disrupt 	 ed 	 	flow	?
Well	,	there	's	a	bunch	of	things	you	could	do	.
You	could	call	Joe	the	 Plumb 	 er 	 	,	for	example	.
And	he	could	come	in	and	fix	the	flow	.
But	in	fact	,	if	you	look	around	the	world	,	not	only	are	there	hope	spots	for	where	we	may	be	able	to	fix	problems	,	there	have	been	places	where	problems	have	been	fixed	,	where	people	have	come	to	grips	with	these	issues	and	begun	to	turn	them	around	.
Monterey	is	one	of	those	.
I	started	out	showing	how	much	we	had	 distress 	 ed 	 	the	Monterey	Bay	ecosystem	with	pollution	and	the	canning	industry	and	all	of	the	attendant	problems	.
In	1932	,	that	's	the	picture	.
In	2009	,	the	picture	is	 dramatic 	 ally 	 	different	.
The	 cann 	 eries 	 	are	gone	.	The	pollution	has	 a 	 bated 	 	.
But	there	's	a	greater	sense	here	that	what	the	individual	communities	need	is	working	 ecosystem 	 s 	 	.
They	need	a	functioning	pyramid	from	the	base	all	the	way	to	the	top	.
And	that	pyramid	in	Monterey	,	right	now	,	because	of	the	efforts	of	a	lot	of	different	people	,	is	functioning	better	than	it	's	ever	 function 	 ed 	 	for	the	last	150	years	.
It	did	n't	happen	 accidental 	 ly 	 	.
It	happened	because	many	people	put	their	time	and	effort	and	their	 pioneer 	 ing 	 	spirit	into	this	.
On	the	left	there	,	Julia	Platt	,	the	mayor	of	my	little	 home 	 town 	 	in	Pacific	Grove	.
At	74	years	old	,	became	mayor	because	something	had	to	be	done	to	protect	the	ocean	.
In	1931	,	she	produced	California	's	first	 community 	 - 	 based 	 	marine	protected	area	,	right	next	to	the	biggest	 pollut 	 ing 	 	cannery	,	because	Julia	knew	that	when	the	 cann 	 eries 	 	 eventual 	 ly 	 	were	gone	,	the	ocean	needed	a	place	to	grow	from	,	that	the	ocean	needed	a	place	to	spark	a	seed	,	and	she	wanted	to	provide	that	seed	.
Other	people	,	like	David	Packard	and	Julie	Packard	,	who	were	instrumental	in	producing	the	Monterey	Bay	aquarium	to	lock	into	people	's	notion	that	the	ocean	and	the	health	of	the	ocean	ecosystem	were	just	as	important	to	the	economy	of	this	area	as	eating	the	ecosystem	would	be	.
That	change	in	thinking	has	led	to	a	dramatic	shift	,	not	only	in	the	 fortune 	 s 	 	of	Monterey	Bay	,	but	other	places	around	the	world	.
Well	,	I	want	to	leave	you	with	the	thought	that	what	we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	here	is	protect	this	ocean	pyramid	,	and	that	ocean	pyramid	 connect 	 s 	 	to	our	own	pyramid	of	life	.
It	's	an	ocean	planet	,	and	we	think	of	 our 	 selves 	 	as	a	terrestrial	species	,	but	the	pyramid	of	life	in	the	ocean	and	our	own	lives	on	land	are	 intricate 	 ly 	 	connected	.
And	it	's	only	through	having	the	ocean	being	healthy	that	we	can	remain	healthy	 our 	 selves 	 	.
Thank	you	very	much	.

I	'll	give	you	an	example	--	if	you	take	a	horseshoe	crab	off	the	beach	,	and	you	fly	it	all	the	way	across	the	continent	,	and	you	drop	it	into	a	 s 	 loped 	 	cage	,	it	will	scramble	up	the	floor	of	the	cage	as	the	tide	is	rising	on	its	home	 shore 	 s 	 	,	and	it	'll	 skitt 	 er 	 	down	again	right	as	the	water	is	 re 	 ceding 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	miles	away	.
It	'll	do	this	for	weeks	,	until	it	kind	of	 gradual 	 ly 	 	 lose 	 s 	 	the	plot	.
And	it	's	 incredibl 	 e 	 	to	watch	,	but	there	's	nothing	psychic	or	paranormal	going	on	;	it	's	simply	that	these	 crab 	 s 	 	have	internal	cycles	that	correspond	,	usually	,	with	what	's	going	on	around	it	.
So	,	we	have	this	ability	as	well	.
And	in	humans	,	we	call	it	the	``	body	clock	.	''
You	can	see	this	most	 clear 	 ly 	 	when	you	take	away	someone	's	watch	and	you	shut	them	into	a	bunker	,	deep	underground	,	for	a	couple	of	months	.
People	actually	volunteer	for	this	,	and	they	usually	come	out	kind	of	 rav 	 ing 	 	about	their	productive	time	in	the	hole	.
So	,	no	matter	how	 a 	 typical 	 	these	subjects	would	have	to	be	,	they	all	show	the	same	thing	.
They	get	up	just	a	little	bit	later	every	day	--	say	15	minutes	or	so	--	and	they	kind	of	drift	all	the	way	around	the	clock	like	this	over	the	course	of	the	weeks	.
And	so	,	in	this	way	we	know	that	they	are	working	on	their	own	internal	clocks	,	rather	than	 some 	 how 	 	sensing	the	day	outside	.
So	fine	,	we	have	a	body	clock	,	and	it	turns	out	that	it	's	 incredibl 	 y 	 	important	in	our	lives	.
It	's	a	huge	driver	for	culture	and	I	think	that	it	's	the	most	 under 	 rated 	 	force	on	our	behavior	.
We	evolved	as	a	species	near	the	equator	,	and	so	we	're	very	 well 	 - 	 equipped 	 	to	deal	with	12	hours	of	daylight	and	12	hours	of	darkness	.
But	of	course	,	we	've	spread	to	every	corner	of	the	globe	and	in	Arctic	Canada	,	where	I	live	,	we	have	perpetual	daylight	in	summer	and	24	hours	of	darkness	in	winter	.
So	the	culture	,	the	northern	aboriginal	culture	,	 traditional 	 ly 	 	has	been	highly	seasonal	.
In	winter	,	there	's	a	lot	of	sleeping	going	on	;	you	enjoy	your	family	life	inside	.
And	in	summer	,	it	's	almost	manic	hunting	and	working	activity	very	long	hours	,	very	active	.
So	,	what	would	our	natural	rhythm	look	like	?
What	would	our	sleeping	patterns	be	in	the	sort	of	ideal	sense	?
Well	,	it	turns	out	that	when	people	are	living	without	any	sort	of	artificial	light	at	all	,	they	sleep	twice	every	night	.
They	go	to	bed	around	8:00	p.m	.
until	midnight	and	then	again	,	they	sleep	from	about	2:00	 a.m 	 . 	 	until	sunrise	.
And	 in 	 - 	 between 	 	,	they	have	a	couple	of	hours	of	sort	of	 med 	 itative 	 	quiet	in	bed	.
And	during	this	time	,	there	's	a	surge	of	prolactin	,	the	 like 	 s 	 	of	which	a	modern	day	never	 see 	 s 	 	.
The	people	in	these	studies	report	feeling	so	awake	during	the	 day 	 time 	 	,	that	they	 realiz 	 e 	 	they	're	 experienc 	 ing 	 	true	 wake 	 fulness 	 	for	the	first	time	in	their	lives	.
So	,	cut	to	the	modern	day	.
We	're	living	in	a	culture	of	jet	lag	,	global	travel	,	24-hour	business	,	shift	work	.
And	you	know	,	our	modern	ways	of	 do 	 ing 	 	things	have	their	 advantage 	 s 	 	,	but	I	believe	we	should	understand	the	costs	.
Thank	you	.

Mihaly	 Csikszent 	 mihaly 	 i 	 	on	flow
I	grew	up	in	Europe	,	and	World	War	II	caught	me	when	I	was	between	seven	and	10	years	old	.
And	I	 re 	 alized 	 	how	few	of	the	 grown 	 - 	 ups 	 	that	I	knew	were	able	to	 with 	 stand 	 	the	 traged 	 ies 	 	that	the	war	visited	on	them	--	how	few	of	them	could	even	 resembl 	 e 	 	a	normal	,	 content 	 ed 	 	,	satisfied	,	happy	life	once	their	job	,	their	home	,	their	security	was	destroyed	by	the	war	.
So	I	became	interested	in	understanding	what	 contribut 	 ed 	 	to	a	life	that	was	worth	living	.
And	I	tried	,	as	a	child	,	as	a	teenager	,	to	read	philosophy	and	to	get	involved	in	art	and	religion	and	many	other	ways	that	I	could	see	as	a	possible	answer	to	that	question	.
And	finally	I	ended	up	 encounter 	 ing 	 	psychology	by	chance	.
I	was	at	a	ski	resort	in	Switzerland	without	any	money	to	actually	enjoy	myself	,	because	the	snow	had	melted	and	I	did	n't	have	money	to	go	to	a	movie	.	But	I	found	that	on	the	--	I	read	in	the	 newspaper 	 s 	 	that	there	was	to	be	a	presentation	by	someone	in	a	place	that	I	'd	seen	in	the	center	of	Zurich	,	and	it	was	about	flying	 saucer 	 s 	 	[	that	]	he	was	going	to	talk	.
And	I	thought	,	well	,	since	I	ca	n't	go	to	the	movies	,	at	least	I	will	go	for	free	to	listen	to	flying	 saucer 	 s 	 	.
And	the	man	who	talked	at	that	evening	lecture	was	very	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
Instead	of	talking	about	little	green	men	,	he	talked	about	how	the	psyche	of	the	 European 	 s 	 	had	been	 traumat 	 ized 	 	by	the	war	,	and	now	they	're	 project 	 ing 	 	flying	 saucer 	 s 	 	into	the	sky	.
He	talked	about	how	the	 mandala 	 s 	 	of	ancient	Hindu	religion	were	kind	of	 project 	 ed 	 	into	the	sky	as	an	attempt	to	regain	some	sense	of	order	after	the	chaos	of	war	.
And	this	 see 	 med 	 	very	 interest 	 ing 	 	to	me	.
And	I	started	reading	his	books	after	that	lecture	.
And	that	was	Carl	Jung	,	whose	name	or	work	I	had	no	idea	about	.
Then	I	came	to	this	country	to	study	psychology	and	I	started	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	the	roots	of	happiness	.
This	is	a	typical	result	that	many	people	have	presented	,	and	there	are	many	variations	on	it	.
But	this	,	for	instance	,	shows	that	about	30	percent	of	the	people	 s 	 urveyed 	 	in	the	United	States	since	1956	say	that	their	life	is	very	happy	.
And	that	has	n't	changed	at	all	.
Whereas	the	personal	income	,	on	a	scale	that	has	been	held	constant	to	 a 	 ccommodate 	 	for	inflation	,	has	more	than	 double 	 d 	 	,	almost	 triple 	 d 	 	,	in	that	period	.
But	you	find	 essential 	 ly 	 	the	same	results	,	 name 	 ly 	 	,	that	after	a	certain	basic	point	--	which	 correspond 	 s 	 	more	or	less	to	just	a	few	1,000	dollars	above	the	minimum	poverty	level	--	 increase 	 s 	 	in	material	 well 	 - 	 being 	 	do	n't	seem	to	affect	how	happy	people	are	.
In	fact	,	you	can	find	that	the	lack	of	basic	resources	,	material	resources	,	 contribut 	 es 	 	to	 un 	 happiness 	 	,	but	the	increase	in	material	resources	does	not	increase	happiness	.
So	my	research	has	been	focused	more	on	--	after	finding	out	these	things	that	actually	 correspond 	 ed 	 	to	my	own	experience	,	I	tried	to	understand	:	where	--	in	everyday	life	,	in	our	normal	experience	--	do	we	feel	 re 	 ally 	 	happy	?
And	to	start	those	studies	about	40	years	ago	,	I	began	to	look	at	creative	people	--	first	artists	and	scientists	,	and	so	forth	--	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	what	made	them	feel	that	it	was	worth	 essential 	 ly 	 	spending	their	life	 do 	 ing 	 	things	for	which	many	of	them	did	n't	expect	either	fame	or	fortune	,	but	which	made	their	life	 meaning 	 ful 	 	and	worth	 do 	 ing 	 	.
This	was	one	of	the	leading	 composer 	 s 	 	of	American	music	back	in	the	'70s	.
And	the	interview	was	40	pages	long	.
But	this	little	excerpt	is	a	very	good	summary	of	what	he	was	saying	during	the	interview	.
And	it	describes	how	he	 feel 	 s 	 	when	composing	is	going	well	.
And	he	says	by	 describ 	 ing 	 	it	as	an	ecstatic	state	.
Now	,	``	ecstasy	''	in	Greek	meant	simply	to	stand	to	the	side	of	something	.
And	then	it	became	 essential 	 ly 	 	an	analogy	for	a	mental	state	where	you	feel	that	you	are	not	 do 	 ing 	 	your	ordinary	everyday	 routine 	 s 	 	.
So	ecstasy	is	 essential 	 ly 	 	a	stepping	into	an	alternative	reality	.
And	it	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	if	you	think	about	it	,	how	,	when	we	think	about	the	 civilization 	 s 	 	that	we	look	up	to	as	having	been	 pinnacle 	 s 	 	of	human	achievement	--	whether	it	's	China	,	Greece	,	the	Hindu	civilization	,	or	the	 Maya 	 s 	 	,	or	 Egyptian 	 s 	 	--	what	we	know	about	them	is	 re 	 ally 	 	about	their	 ecstasi 	 es 	 	,	not	about	their	everyday	life	.
We	know	the	temples	they	built	,	where	people	could	come	to	experience	a	different	reality	.
We	know	about	the	 circus 	 es 	 	,	the	 arena 	 s 	 	,	the	 theater 	 s 	 	.
These	are	the	remains	of	 civilization 	 s 	 	and	they	are	the	places	that	people	went	to	experience	life	in	a	more	concentrated	,	more	ordered	form	.
Now	,	this	man	does	n't	need	to	go	to	a	place	like	this	,	which	is	also	--	this	place	,	this	arena	,	which	is	built	like	a	Greek	amphitheatre	,	is	a	place	for	ecstasy	also	.
We	are	 participat 	 ing 	 	in	a	reality	that	is	different	from	that	of	the	everyday	life	that	we	're	used	to	.
But	this	man	does	n't	need	to	go	there	.
He	needs	just	a	piece	of	paper	where	he	can	put	down	little	marks	,	and	as	he	does	that	,	he	can	imagine	sounds	that	had	not	existed	before	in	that	particular	combination	.
So	once	he	 get 	 s 	 	to	that	point	of	beginning	to	create	,	like	Jennifer	did	in	her	improvisation	,	a	new	reality	--	that	is	,	a	moment	of	ecstasy	--	he	enters	that	different	reality	.
Now	he	says	also	that	this	is	so	intense	an	experience	that	it	 feel 	 s 	 	almost	as	if	he	did	n't	exist	.
And	that	sounds	like	a	kind	of	a	romantic	 exaggerat 	 ion 	 	.
But	actually	,	our	nervous	system	is	 in 	 capable 	 	of	processing	more	than	about	110	bits	of	information	per	second	.
And	in	order	to	hear	me	and	understand	what	I	'm	saying	,	you	need	to	process	about	60	bits	per	second	.
That	's	why	you	ca	n't	hear	more	than	two	people	.
You	ca	n't	understand	more	than	two	people	talking	to	you	.
Well	,	when	you	are	 re 	 ally 	 	involved	in	this	 complete 	 ly 	 	engaging	process	of	creating	something	new	,	as	this	man	is	,	he	does	n't	have	enough	attention	left	over	to	monitor	how	his	body	 feel 	 s 	 	,	or	his	problems	at	home	.
He	ca	n't	feel	even	that	he	's	hungry	or	tired	.
His	body	 disappear 	 s 	 	,	his	identity	 disappear 	 s 	 	from	his	consciousness	,	because	he	does	n't	have	enough	attention	,	like	none	of	us	do	,	to	 re 	 ally 	 	do	well	something	that	 require 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	concentration	,	and	at	the	same	time	to	feel	that	he	exists	.
So	existence	is	 tempor 	 arily 	 	 suspend 	 ed 	 	.
And	he	says	that	his	hand	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	moving	by	itself	.
Now	,	I	could	look	at	my	hand	for	two	weeks	,	and	I	would	n't	feel	any	awe	or	wonder	,	because	I	ca	n't	compose	.
So	what	it	's	telling	you	here	is	that	 obvious 	 ly 	 	this	automatic	,	spontaneous	process	that	he	's	 describ 	 ing 	 	can	only	happen	to	someone	who	is	very	well	trained	and	who	has	developed	technique	.
And	it	has	become	a	kind	of	a	 tru 	 ism 	 	in	the	study	of	creativity	that	you	ca	n't	be	creating	anything	with	less	than	10	years	of	 technical 	 - 	 knowledge 	 	immersion	in	a	particular	field	.
Whether	it	's	mathematics	or	music	,	it	takes	that	long	to	be	able	to	begin	to	change	something	in	a	way	that	it	's	better	than	what	was	there	before	.
Now	,	when	that	 happen 	 s 	 	,	he	says	the	music	just	flows	out	.
And	because	all	of	these	people	I	started	 interview 	 ing 	 	--	this	was	an	interview	which	is	over	30	years	old	--	so	many	of	the	people	described	this	as	a	spontaneous	flow	that	I	called	this	type	of	experience	the	``	flow	experience	.	''
And	it	 happen 	 s 	 	in	different	realms	.
For	instance	,	a	poet	describes	it	in	this	form	.
This	is	by	a	student	of	mine	who	 interview 	 ed 	 	some	of	the	leading	writers	and	poets	in	the	United	States	.
And	it	describes	the	same	 effort 	 less 	 	,	spontaneous	feeling	that	you	get	when	you	enter	into	this	ecstatic	state	.
This	poet	describes	it	as	opening	a	door	that	 float 	 s 	 	in	the	sky	--	a	very	similar	description	to	what	Albert	Einstein	gave	as	to	how	he	imagined	the	forces	of	relativity	,	when	he	was	 strugg 	 ling 	 	with	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	how	it	worked	.
But	it	 happen 	 s 	 	in	other	activities	.
For	instance	,	this	is	another	student	of	mine	,	Susan	Jackson	from	Australia	,	who	did	work	with	some	of	the	leading	athletes	in	the	world	.
And	you	see	here	in	this	description	of	an	Olympic	skater	,	the	same	essential	description	of	the	phenomenology	of	the	inner	state	of	the	person	.
You	do	n't	think	;	it	goes	 automatic 	 ally 	 	,	if	you	merge	yourself	with	the	music	,	and	so	forth	.
It	 happen 	 s 	 	also	,	actually	,	in	the	most	recent	book	I	wrote	,	called	``	Good	Business	,	''	where	I	 interview 	 ed 	 	some	of	the	 CEO 	 s 	 	who	had	been	nominated	by	their	peers	as	being	both	very	successful	and	very	ethical	,	very	 social 	 ly 	 	 responsibl 	 e 	 	.
You	see	that	these	people	define	success	as	something	that	 help 	 s 	 	others	and	at	the	same	time	makes	you	feel	happy	as	you	are	working	at	it	.
And	like	all	of	these	successful	and	 responsibl 	 e 	 	 CEO 	 s 	 	say	,	you	ca	n't	have	just	one	of	these	things	be	successful	if	you	want	a	 meaning 	 ful 	 	and	successful	job	.
Anita	Roddick	is	another	one	of	these	 CEO 	 s 	 	we	 interview 	 ed 	 	.
She	is	the	founder	of	Body	Shop	,	the	natural	 cosmetic 	 s 	 	king	.
It	's	kind	of	a	passion	that	comes	from	 do 	 ing 	 	the	best	and	having	flow	while	you	're	working	.
This	is	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	little	quote	from	 Masa 	 ru 	 	 I 	 buka 	 	,	who	was	at	that	time	starting	out	Sony	without	any	money	,	without	a	product	--	they	did	n't	have	a	product	,	they	did	n't	have	anything	,	but	they	had	an	idea	.
And	the	idea	he	had	was	to	establish	a	place	of	work	where	 engineer 	 s 	 	can	feel	the	joy	of	technological	innovation	,	be	aware	of	their	mission	to	society	and	work	to	their	heart	's	content	.
I	could	n't	improve	on	this	as	a	good	example	of	how	flow	enters	the	workplace	.
Now	,	when	we	do	studies	--	we	have	,	with	other	 colleague 	 s 	 	around	the	world	,	done	over	8,000	interviews	of	people	--	from	Dominican	monks	,	to	blind	nuns	,	to	 Himalaya 	 n 	 	climbers	,	to	Navajo	 shepherd 	 s 	 	--	who	enjoy	their	work	.
And	 regardles 	 s 	 	of	the	culture	,	 regardles 	 s 	 	of	education	or	whatever	,	there	are	these	seven	conditions	that	seem	to	be	there	when	a	person	is	in	flow	.
There	's	this	focus	that	,	once	it	becomes	intense	,	leads	to	a	sense	of	ecstasy	,	a	sense	of	clarity	:	you	know	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	you	want	to	do	from	one	moment	to	the	other	;	you	get	immediate	feedback	.
You	know	that	what	you	need	to	do	is	possible	to	do	,	even	though	difficult	,	and	sense	of	time	 disappear 	 s 	 	,	you	forget	yourself	,	you	feel	part	of	something	larger	.
And	once	the	conditions	are	present	,	what	you	are	 do 	 ing 	 	becomes	worth	 do 	 ing 	 	for	its	own	sake	.
In	our	studies	,	we	represent	the	everyday	life	of	people	in	this	simple	scheme	.
And	we	can	measure	this	very	 precise 	 ly 	 	,	actually	,	because	we	give	people	electronic	 pager 	 s 	 	that	go	off	10	times	a	day	,	and	whenever	they	go	off	you	say	what	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	,	how	you	feel	,	where	you	are	,	what	you	're	thinking	about	.
And	two	things	that	we	measure	is	the	amount	of	challenge	people	experience	at	that	moment	and	the	amount	of	skill	that	they	feel	they	have	at	that	moment	.
So	for	each	person	we	can	establish	an	average	,	which	is	the	center	of	the	diagram	.
That	would	be	your	mean	level	of	challenge	and	skill	,	which	will	be	different	from	that	of	 any 	 body 	 	else	.
But	you	have	a	kind	of	a	set	point	there	,	which	would	be	in	the	middle	.
If	we	know	what	that	set	point	is	,	we	can	predict	 fair 	 ly 	 	 accurate 	 ly 	 	when	you	will	be	in	flow	,	and	it	will	be	when	your	challenges	are	higher	than	average	and	skills	are	higher	than	average	.
And	you	may	be	 do 	 ing 	 	things	very	 different 	 ly 	 	from	other	people	,	but	for	everyone	that	flow	channel	,	that	area	there	,	will	be	when	you	are	 do 	 ing 	 	what	you	 re 	 ally 	 	like	to	do	--	play	the	piano	,	be	with	your	best	friend	,	 perhap 	 s 	 	work	,	if	work	is	what	provides	flow	for	you	.
And	then	the	other	areas	become	less	and	less	positive	.
Arousal	is	still	good	because	you	are	 over 	 - 	 challenge 	 d 	 	there	.
Your	skills	are	not	quite	as	high	as	they	should	be	,	but	you	can	move	into	flow	 fair 	 ly 	 	easily	by	just	developing	a	little	more	skill	.
So	,	arousal	is	the	area	where	most	people	learn	from	,	because	that	's	where	they	're	 push 	 ed 	 	beyond	their	comfort	zone	and	to	enter	that	--	going	back	to	flow	--	then	they	develop	higher	skills	.
Control	is	also	a	good	place	to	be	,	because	there	you	feel	 comfortabl 	 e 	 	,	but	not	very	excited	.
It	's	not	very	 challeng 	 ing 	 	any	more	.
And	if	you	want	to	enter	flow	from	control	,	you	have	to	increase	the	challenges	.
So	those	two	are	ideal	and	complementary	areas	from	which	flow	is	easy	to	go	into	.
The	other	 combination 	 s 	 	of	challenge	and	skill	become	 progressive 	 ly 	 	less	optimal	.
 Relax 	 ation 	 	is	fine	--	you	still	feel	OK	.
Boredom	begins	to	be	very	 a 	 versive 	 	and	 a 	 pathy 	 	becomes	very	negative	:	you	do	n't	feel	that	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	anything	,	you	do	n't	use	your	skills	,	there	's	no	challenge	.
Unfortunately	,	a	lot	of	people	's	experience	is	in	 a 	 pathy 	 	.
The	largest	single	contributor	to	that	experience	is	watching	television	;	the	next	one	is	being	in	the	bathroom	,	sitting	.
Even	though	sometimes	watching	television	about	seven	to	eight	percent	of	the	time	is	in	flow	,	but	that	's	when	you	choose	a	program	you	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	watch	and	you	get	feedback	from	it	.
So	the	question	we	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	address	--	and	I	'm	way	over	time	--	is	how	to	put	more	and	more	of	everyday	life	in	that	flow	channel	.
And	that	is	the	kind	of	challenge	that	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	.
And	some	of	you	 obvious 	 ly 	 	know	how	to	do	that	 spontaneous 	 ly 	 	without	any	advice	,	but	 unfortunat 	 ely 	 	a	lot	of	people	do	n't	.
And	that	's	what	our	mandate	is	,	in	a	way	,	to	do	.
Thank	you	.

Yves	Behar	's	 super 	 charged 	 	motorcycle	design
Forrest	North	:	The	beginning	of	any	collaboration	starts	with	a	conversation	.
And	I	would	like	to	share	with	you	some	of	the	bits	of	the	conversation	that	we	started	with	.
I	grew	up	in	a	log	cabin	in	Washington	state	with	too	much	time	on	my	hands	.
Yves	Behar	:	And	in	scenic	Switzerland	for	me	.
FN	:	I	always	had	a	passion	for	alternative	vehicles	.
This	is	a	land	yacht	racing	across	the	desert	in	Nevada	.
YB	:	 C 	 ombination 	 	of	 windsurf 	 ing 	 	and	 ski 	 ing 	 	into	this	invention	there	.
FN	:	And	I	also	had	an	interest	in	dangerous	 invention 	 s 	 	.
This	is	a	100,000-volt	Tesla	coil	that	I	built	in	my	bedroom	,	much	to	the	dismay	of	my	mother	.
YB	:	To	the	dismay	of	my	mother	,	this	is	dangerous	teenage	fashion	right	there	.
FN	:	And	I	brought	this	all	together	,	this	passion	with	alternative	energy	and	raced	a	solar	car	across	Australia	--	also	the	U.S.	and	Japan	.
YB	:	So	,	wind	power	,	solar	power	--	we	had	a	lot	to	talk	about	.
We	had	a	lot	that	got	us	excited	.
So	we	decided	to	do	a	special	project	together	.
To	 combin 	 e 	 	engineering	and	design	and	...
FN	:	 Re 	 ally 	 	make	a	fully	integrated	product	,	something	beautiful	.
YB	:	And	we	made	a	baby	.
FN	:	Can	you	bring	out	our	baby	?
This	baby	is	fully	electric	.
It	goes	150	miles	an	hour	.
It	's	twice	the	range	of	any	electric	motorcycle	.
 Re 	 ally 	 	the	 excit 	 ing 	 	thing	about	a	motorcycle	is	just	the	beautiful	integration	of	engineering	and	design	.
It	's	got	an	amazing	user	experience	.
It	was	wonderful	working	with	Yves	Behar	.
He	came	up	with	our	name	and	logo	.	We	're	Mission	 Motor 	 s 	 	.
And	we	've	only	got	three	minutes	,	but	we	could	talk	about	it	for	hours	.
YB	:	Thank	you	.
FN	:	Thank	you	TED	.	And	thank	you	Chris	,	for	having	us	.

Katherine	Fulton	:	You	are	the	future	of	philanthropy
I	want	to	help	you	 re 	 - 	 perceiv 	 e 	 	what	philanthropy	is	,	what	it	could	be	,	and	what	your	relationship	to	it	is	.
And	in	 do 	 ing 	 	that	,	I	want	to	offer	you	a	vision	,	an	imagined	future	,	if	you	will	,	of	how	,	as	the	poet	Seamus	 He 	 aney 	 	has	put	it	,	``	Once	in	a	lifetime	the	 long 	 ed 	 - 	 for 	 	tidal	wave	of	justice	can	rise	up	,	and	hope	and	history	rhyme	.	''
I	want	to	start	with	these	word	pairs	here	.
We	all	know	which	side	of	these	we	'd	like	to	be	on	.
When	philanthropy	was	 rein 	 vented 	 	a	century	ago	,	when	the	foundation	form	was	actually	 invent 	 ed 	 	,	they	did	n't	think	of	themselves	on	the	wrong	side	of	these	either	.
In	fact	they	would	never	have	thought	of	themselves	as	closed	and	set	in	their	ways	,	as	slow	to	respond	to	new	challenges	,	as	small	and	 risk 	 - 	 a 	 verse 	 	.
And	in	fact	they	were	n't	.	They	were	 rein 	 venting 	 	charity	in	those	times	,	what	Rockefeller	called	``	the	business	of	benevolence	.	''
But	by	the	end	of	the	20th	century	,	a	new	generation	of	critics	and	 reformer 	 s 	 	had	come	to	see	philanthropy	just	this	way	.
The	thing	to	watch	for	as	a	global	philanthropy	industry	comes	about	--	and	that	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	is	happening	--	is	how	the	aspiration	is	to	flip	these	old	 assumption 	 s 	 	,	for	philanthropy	to	become	open	and	big	and	fast	and	connected	,	in	service	of	the	long	term	.
This	 entrepreneur 	 ial 	 	energy	is	emerging	from	many	quarters	.
And	it	's	driven	and	 pro 	 pelled 	 	forward	by	new	leaders	,	like	many	of	the	people	here	,	by	new	tools	,	like	the	ones	we	've	seen	here	,	and	by	new	 pressure 	 s 	 	.
I	've	been	following	this	change	for	quite	a	while	now	,	and	 participat 	 ing 	 	in	it	.
This	report	is	our	main	public	report	.
What	it	 tell 	 s 	 	is	the	story	of	how	today	actually	could	be	as	historic	as	100	years	ago	.
What	I	want	to	do	is	share	some	of	the	 cool 	 est 	 	things	that	are	going	on	with	you	.
And	as	I	do	that	,	I	'm	not	going	to	dwell	much	on	the	very	large	philanthropy	that	everybody	already	knows	about	--	the	Gates	or	the	 Soro 	 s 	 	or	the	Google	.
Instead	,	what	I	want	to	do	is	talk	about	the	philanthropy	of	all	of	us	:	the	 democrat 	 ization 	 	of	philanthropy	.
This	is	a	moment	in	history	when	the	average	person	has	more	power	than	at	any	time	.
What	I	'm	going	to	do	is	look	at	five	categories	of	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	each	of	which	challenges	an	old	assumption	of	philanthropy	.
The	first	is	mass	collaboration	,	represented	here	by	Wikipedia	.
Now	,	this	may	surprise	you	.
But	remember	,	philanthropy	is	about	giving	of	time	and	talent	,	not	just	money	.
Clay	 Shir 	 ky 	 	,	that	great	 chronicle 	 r 	 	of	everything	 network 	 ed 	 	,	has	captured	the	assumption	that	this	challenges	in	such	a	beautiful	way	.
He	said	,	``	We	have	lived	in	this	world	where	little	things	are	done	for	love	and	big	things	for	money	.
Now	we	have	Wikipedia	.
Suddenly	big	things	can	be	done	for	love	.	''
Watch	,	this	spring	,	for	Paul	 Hawk 	 en 	 	's	new	book	--	Author	and	entrepreneur	many	of	you	may	know	about	.
The	book	is	called	``	Blessed	 Un 	 rest 	 	.	''
And	when	it	comes	out	,	a	series	of	wiki	sites	under	the	label	WISER	,	are	going	to	launch	at	the	same	time	.
WISER	stands	for	World	Index	for	Social	and	Environmental	Responsibility	.
WISER	sets	out	to	document	,	link	and	empower	what	Paul	calls	the	largest	movement	,	and	 fast 	 est 	 - 	 growing 	 	movement	in	human	history	:	humanity	's	collective	immune	response	to	today	's	threats	.
Now	,	all	of	these	big	things	for	love	--	 experiment 	 s 	 	--	are	n't	going	to	take	off	.
But	the	ones	that	do	are	going	to	be	the	biggest	,	the	most	open	,	the	 fast 	 est 	 	,	the	most	connected	form	of	philanthropy	in	human	history	.
Second	category	is	online	philanthropy	 market 	 places 	 	.
This	is	,	of	course	,	to	philanthropy	what	 e 	 Bay 	 	and	Amazon	are	to	commerce	.
Think	of	it	as	 peer 	 - 	 to 	 - 	 peer 	 	philanthropy	.
And	this	challenges	yet	another	assumption	,	which	is	that	organized	philanthropy	is	only	for	the	very	 wealth 	 y 	 	.
Take	a	look	,	if	you	have	n't	,	at	 Donor 	 s 	 Choose 	 	.
 Omid 	 yar 	 	Network	has	made	a	big	investment	in	 Donor 	 s 	 Choose 	 	.
It	's	one	of	the	best	known	of	these	new	 market 	 places 	 	where	a	donor	can	go	straight	into	a	classroom	and	connect	with	what	a	teacher	says	they	need	.
Take	a	look	at	Changing	the	Present	,	started	by	a	 TED 	 ster 	 	,	next	time	you	need	a	wedding	present	or	a	holiday	present	.
 Give 	 India 	 	is	for	a	whole	country	.
And	it	goes	on	and	on	.
The	third	category	is	represented	by	Warren	Buffet	,	which	I	call	 aggregate 	 d 	 	giving	.
It	's	not	just	that	Warren	Buffet	was	so	 amazing 	 ly 	 	generous	in	that	historic	act	last	summer	.
It	's	that	he	 challenge 	 d 	 	another	assumption	,	that	every	giver	should	have	his	or	her	own	fund	or	foundation	.
There	are	now	,	today	,	so	many	new	funds	that	are	 aggregat 	 ing 	 	giving	and	 invest 	 ing 	 	,	bringing	together	people	around	a	common	goal	,	to	think	 bigg 	 er 	 	.
One	of	the	best	known	is	 Acu 	 men 	 	Fund	,	led	by	Jacqueline	 Novo 	 gratz 	 	,	a	 TED 	 ster 	 	who	got	a	big	boost	here	at	TED	.
But	there	are	many	others	:	New	Profit	in	Cambridge	,	New	School	's	Venture	Fund	in	Silicon	Valley	,	Venture	Philanthropy	Partners	in	Washington	,	Global	Fund	for	Women	in	San	Francisco	.
Take	a	look	at	these	.
These	funds	are	to	philanthropy	what	venture	capital	,	private	equity	,	and	 eventual 	 ly 	 	mutual	funds	are	to	 invest 	 ing 	 	,	but	with	a	twist	--	because	often	a	community	forms	around	these	funds	,	as	it	has	at	 Acu 	 men 	 	and	other	places	.
Now	,	imagine	for	a	second	these	first	three	types	of	 experiment 	 s 	 	:	mass	collaboration	,	online	 market 	 places 	 	,	 aggregate 	 d 	 	giving	.
And	understand	how	they	help	us	 re 	 - 	 perceiv 	 e 	 	what	organized	philanthropy	is	.
It	's	not	about	 foundation 	 s 	 	 necessar 	 ily 	 	;	it	's	about	the	rest	of	us	.
I	'm	going	to	look	quickly	at	the	fourth	and	fifth	categories	,	which	are	innovation	,	competitions	and	social	 invest 	 ing 	 	.
They	're	betting	a	visible	competition	,	a	prize	,	can	attract	talent	and	money	to	some	of	the	most	difficult	issues	,	and	 there 	 by 	 	speed	the	solution	.
This	 tackle 	 s 	 	yet	another	assumption	,	that	the	giver	and	the	organization	is	at	the	center	,	as	opposed	to	putting	the	problem	at	the	center	.
You	can	look	to	these	 innova 	 tors 	 	to	help	us	especially	with	things	that	require	technological	or	scientific	solution	.
That	leaves	the	final	category	,	social	 invest 	 ing 	 	,	which	is	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 any 	 way 	 	,	the	biggest	of	them	all	,	represented	here	by	 Xi 	 gi 	 .net 	 	.
And	this	,	of	course	,	 tackle 	 s 	 	the	biggest	assumption	of	all	,	that	business	is	business	,	and	philanthropy	is	the	vehicle	of	people	who	want	to	create	change	in	the	world	.
 Xi 	 gi 	 	is	a	new	community	site	that	's	built	by	the	community	,	linking	and	mapping	this	new	social	capital	market	.
It	lists	already	1,000	entities	that	are	offering	debt	and	equity	for	social	enterprise	.
So	we	can	look	to	these	 innova 	 tors 	 	to	help	us	remember	that	if	we	can	leverage	even	a	small	amount	of	the	capital	that	 seek 	 s 	 	a	return	,	the	good	that	can	be	driven	could	be	 astonish 	 ing 	 	.
Now	,	what	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	here	is	that	we	're	not	thinking	our	way	into	a	new	way	of	acting	;	we	're	acting	our	way	into	a	new	way	of	thinking	.
Philanthropy	is	 re 	 organizing 	 	itself	before	our	very	eyes	.
And	even	though	all	of	the	 experiment 	 s 	 	and	all	of	the	big	givers	do	n't	yet	fulfill	this	aspiration	,	I	think	this	is	the	new	 zeit 	 geist 	 	:	open	,	big	,	fast	,	connected	,	and	,	let	us	also	hope	,	long	.
We	have	got	to	 realiz 	 e 	 	that	it	is	going	to	take	a	long	time	to	do	these	things	.
If	we	do	n't	develop	the	 stamin 	 a 	 	to	stick	with	things	--	whatever	it	is	you	pick	,	stick	with	it	--	all	of	this	stuff	is	just	going	to	be	,	you	know	,	a	fad	.
But	I	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	hopeful	.
And	I	'm	hopeful	because	it	's	not	only	philanthropy	that	's	 re 	 organizing 	 	itself	,	it	's	also	whole	other	 portion 	 s 	 	of	the	social	sector	,	and	of	business	,	that	are	busy	 challeng 	 ing 	 	``	business	as	usual	.	''
And	everywhere	I	go	,	including	here	at	TED	,	I	feel	that	there	is	a	new	moral	hunger	that	is	growing	.
What	we	're	seeing	is	people	 re 	 ally 	 	wrestling	to	describe	what	is	this	new	thing	that	's	happening	.
Words	like	``	 philanthro 	 capitalism 	 	,	''	and	``	natural	capitalism	,	''	and	``	 philanthro 	 entrepreneur 	 	,	''	and	``	venture	philanthropy	.	''
We	do	n't	have	a	language	for	it	yet	.
Whatever	we	call	it	,	it	's	new	,	it	's	beginning	,	and	I	think	it	's	gong	to	quite	significant	.
And	that	's	where	my	imagined	future	comes	in	,	which	I	am	going	to	call	the	social	 singular 	 ity 	 	.
Many	of	you	will	 realiz 	 e 	 	that	I	'm	 ripp 	 ing 	 	a	bit	off	of	the	science	fiction	writer	 Ver 	 nor 	 	Vinge	's	notion	of	a	technological	 singular 	 ity 	 	,	where	a	number	of	trends	accelerate	and	converge	and	come	together	to	create	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	a	 shock 	 ingly 	 	new	reality	.
It	may	be	that	the	social	 singular 	 ity 	 	 a 	 head 	 	is	the	one	that	we	fear	the	most	:	a	convergence	of	 catastroph 	 es 	 	,	of	environmental	degradation	,	of	weapons	of	mass	destruction	,	of	 pandemic 	 s 	 	,	of	poverty	.
That	's	because	our	ability	to	confront	the	problems	that	we	face	has	not	kept	pace	with	our	ability	to	create	them	.
And	as	we	've	heard	here	,	it	is	no	 exaggerat 	 ion 	 	to	say	that	we	hold	the	future	of	our	civilization	in	our	hands	as	never	before	.
The	question	is	,	is	there	a	positive	social	 singular 	 ity 	 	?
Is	there	a	frontier	for	us	of	how	we	live	together	?
Our	future	does	n't	have	to	be	imagined	.
We	can	create	a	future	where	hope	and	history	rhyme	.
But	we	have	a	problem	.
Our	experience	to	date	,	both	 individual 	 ly 	 	and	 collective 	 ly 	 	,	has	n't	prepared	us	for	what	we	're	going	to	need	to	do	,	or	who	we	're	going	to	need	to	be	.
We	are	going	to	need	a	new	generation	of	citizen	leaders	willing	to	commit	 our 	 selves 	 	to	growing	and	changing	and	learning	as	rapidly	as	possible	.
That	's	why	I	have	one	last	thing	I	want	to	show	you	.
This	is	a	photograph	taken	about	100	years	ago	of	my	grandfather	and	 great 	 - 	 grandfather 	 	.
This	is	a	newspaper	publisher	and	a	 bank 	 er 	 	.
And	they	were	great	community	leaders	.
And	,	yes	,	they	were	great	 philanthropist 	 s 	 	.
I	keep	this	photograph	close	by	to	me	--	it	's	in	my	office	--	because	I	've	always	felt	a	 mystic 	 al 	 	connection	to	these	two	men	,	both	of	whom	I	never	knew	.
And	so	,	in	their	honor	,	I	want	to	offer	you	this	blank	slide	.
And	I	want	you	to	imagine	that	this	a	photograph	of	you	.
And	I	want	you	to	think	about	the	community	that	you	want	to	be	part	of	creating	.
Whatever	that	means	to	you	.
And	I	want	you	to	imagine	that	it	's	100	years	from	now	,	and	your	grandchild	,	or	 great 	 - 	 grandchild 	 	,	or	niece	or	nephew	or	 god 	 - 	 child 	 	,	is	looking	at	this	photograph	of	you	.
What	is	the	story	you	most	want	for	them	to	tell	?
Thank	you	very	much	.

Hanna	Rosin	:	New	data	on	the	rise	of	women
We	are	now	going	through	an	amazing	and	 un 	 precedent 	 ed 	 	moment	where	the	power	dynamics	between	men	and	women	are	shifting	very	rapidly	,	and	in	many	of	the	places	where	it	counts	the	most	,	women	are	,	in	fact	,	taking	control	of	everything	.
In	my	mother	's	day	,	she	did	n't	go	to	college	.
Not	a	lot	of	women	did	.
And	now	,	for	every	two	men	who	get	a	college	degree	,	three	women	will	do	the	same	.
Women	,	for	the	first	time	this	year	,	became	the	majority	of	the	American	workforce	.
And	they	're	starting	to	dominate	lots	of	 profession 	 s 	 	--	doctors	,	lawyers	,	 bank 	 ers 	 	,	 account 	 ants 	 	.
Over	50	percent	of	 manager 	 s 	 	are	women	these	days	,	and	in	the	15	 profession 	 s 	 	 project 	 ed 	 	to	grow	the	most	in	the	next	decade	,	all	but	two	of	them	are	dominated	by	women	.
So	the	global	economy	is	becoming	a	place	where	women	are	more	successful	than	men	,	believe	it	or	not	,	and	these	economic	changes	are	starting	to	rapidly	affect	our	culture	--	what	our	romantic	comedies	look	like	,	what	our	 marriage 	 s 	 	look	like	,	what	our	dating	lives	look	like	,	and	our	new	set	of	 superhero 	 es 	 	.
For	a	long	time	,	this	is	the	image	of	American	 man 	 hood 	 	that	dominated	--	tough	,	rugged	,	in	control	of	his	own	environment	.
A	few	years	ago	,	the	Marlboro	Man	was	retired	and	replaced	by	this	much	less	 impressiv 	 e 	 	specimen	,	who	is	a	parody	of	American	 man 	 hood 	 	,	and	that	's	what	we	have	in	our	 commercial 	 s 	 	today	.
The	phrase	``	 first 	 - 	 born 	 	son	''	is	so	 deep 	 ly 	 	 in 	 grained 	 	in	our	consciousness	that	this	statistic	alone	 shock 	 ed 	 	me	.
In	American	fertility	 clinic 	 s 	 	,	75	percent	of	 couple 	 s 	 	are	 request 	 ing 	 	girls	and	not	boys	.
And	in	places	where	you	would	n't	think	,	such	as	South	Korea	,	India	and	China	,	the	very	strict	 patriarch 	 al 	 	societies	are	starting	to	break	down	a	little	,	and	families	are	no	 long 	 er 	 	 strong 	 ly 	 	 preferr 	 ing 	 	 first 	 - 	 born 	 	sons	.
If	you	think	about	this	,	if	you	just	open	your	eyes	to	this	possibility	and	start	to	connect	the	dots	,	you	can	see	the	evidence	everywhere	.
You	can	see	it	in	college	graduation	patterns	,	in	job	 projection 	 s 	 	,	in	our	marriage	statistics	,	you	can	see	it	in	the	Icelandic	elections	,	which	you	'll	hear	about	later	,	and	you	can	see	it	on	South	Korean	surveys	on	son	preference	,	that	something	amazing	and	 un 	 precedent 	 ed 	 	is	happening	with	women	.
 Certain 	 ly 	 	this	is	not	the	first	time	that	we	've	had	great	progress	with	women	.
The	'20s	and	the	'60s	also	come	to	mind	.
But	the	difference	is	that	,	back	then	,	it	was	driven	by	a	very	passionate	feminist	movement	that	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	project	its	own	 desire 	 s 	 	,	whereas	this	time	,	it	's	not	about	passion	,	and	it	's	not	about	any	kind	of	movement	.
This	is	 re 	 ally 	 	just	about	the	facts	of	this	economic	moment	that	we	live	in	.
The	200,000-year	period	in	which	men	have	been	top	dog	is	 tru 	 ly 	 	coming	to	an	end	,	believe	it	or	not	,	and	that	's	why	I	talk	about	the	``	end	of	men	.	''
Now	all	you	men	out	there	,	this	is	not	the	moment	where	you	tune	out	or	throw	some	tomatoes	,	because	the	point	is	that	this	is	happening	to	all	of	us	.
I	myself	have	a	husband	and	a	father	and	two	sons	whom	I	 d 	 early 	 	love	.
And	this	is	why	I	like	to	talk	about	this	,	because	if	we	do	n't	 acknowledg 	 e 	 	it	,	then	the	transition	will	be	pretty	 pain 	 ful 	 	.
But	if	we	do	take	account	of	it	,	then	I	think	it	will	go	much	more	 smooth 	 ly 	 	.
I	first	started	thinking	about	this	about	a	year	and	a	half	ago	.
I	was	reading	 headline 	 s 	 	about	the	recession	just	like	 any 	 one 	 	else	,	and	I	started	to	notice	a	distinct	pattern	--	that	the	recession	was	 affect 	 ing 	 	men	much	more	 deep 	 ly 	 	than	it	was	 affect 	 ing 	 	women	.
And	I	remembered	back	to	about	10	years	ago	when	I	read	a	book	by	Susan	 Falu 	 di 	 	called	``	 Stiff 	 ed 	 	:	The	Betrayal	of	the	American	Man	,	''	in	which	she	described	how	hard	the	recession	had	hit	men	,	and	I	started	to	think	about	whether	it	had	gotten	worse	this	time	around	in	this	recession	.
And	I	 re 	 alized 	 	that	two	things	were	different	this	time	around	.
The	first	was	that	these	were	no	 long 	 er 	 	just	temporary	hits	that	the	recession	was	giving	men	--	that	this	was	reflecting	a	 deep 	 er 	 	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	shift	in	our	global	economy	.
And	second	,	that	the	story	was	no	 long 	 er 	 	just	about	the	crisis	of	men	,	but	it	was	also	about	what	was	happening	to	women	.
And	now	look	at	this	second	set	of	slides	.
These	are	 headline 	 s 	 	about	what	's	been	going	on	with	women	in	the	next	few	years	.
These	are	things	we	never	could	have	imagined	a	few	years	ago	.
Women	,	a	majority	of	the	workplace	.
And	labor	statistics	:	women	take	up	most	managerial	jobs	.
This	second	set	of	 headline 	 s 	 	--	you	can	see	that	families	and	 marriage 	 s 	 	are	starting	to	shift	.
And	look	at	that	last	headline	--	young	women	earning	more	than	young	men	.
That	particular	headline	comes	to	me	from	a	market	research	firm	.
They	were	 bas 	 ically 	 	asked	by	one	of	their	clients	who	was	going	to	buy	houses	in	that	neighborhood	in	the	future	.
And	they	expected	that	it	would	be	young	families	,	or	young	men	,	just	like	it	had	always	been	.
But	in	fact	,	they	found	something	very	 surpris 	 ing 	 	.
It	was	young	,	single	women	who	were	the	major	 pur 	 chasers 	 	of	houses	in	the	neighborhood	.
And	so	they	decided	,	because	they	were	 intrigue 	 d 	 	by	this	finding	,	to	do	a	nationwide	survey	.
So	they	spread	out	all	the	census	data	,	and	what	they	found	,	the	guy	described	to	me	as	a	 shock 	 er 	 	,	which	is	that	in	1,997	out	of	2,000	communities	,	women	,	young	women	,	were	making	more	money	than	young	men	.
So	here	you	have	a	generation	of	young	women	who	grow	up	thinking	of	themselves	as	being	more	powerful	 earner 	 s 	 	than	the	young	men	around	them	.
Now	,	I	've	just	laid	out	the	picture	for	you	,	but	I	still	have	n't	explained	to	you	why	this	is	happening	.
And	in	a	moment	,	I	'm	going	to	show	you	a	graph	,	and	what	you	'll	see	on	this	graph	--	it	begins	in	1973	,	just	before	women	start	flooding	the	workforce	,	and	it	 bring 	 s 	 	us	up	to	our	current	day	.
And	 bas 	 ically 	 	what	you	'll	see	is	what	 economist 	 s 	 	talk	about	as	the	polarization	of	the	economy	.
Now	what	does	that	mean	?
It	means	that	the	economy	is	dividing	into	 high 	 - 	 skill 	 	,	 high 	 - 	 wage 	 	jobs	and	 low 	 - 	 skill 	 	,	 low 	 - 	 wage 	 	jobs	--	and	that	the	middle	,	the	 middle 	 - 	 skill 	 	jobs	,	and	the	 middle 	 - 	 earning 	 	jobs	,	are	starting	to	drop	out	of	the	economy	.
This	has	been	going	on	for	40	years	now	.
But	this	process	is	 affect 	 ing 	 	men	very	 different 	 ly 	 	than	it	's	 affect 	 ing 	 	women	.
You	'll	see	the	women	in	red	,	and	you	'll	see	the	men	in	blue	.
You	'll	watch	them	both	drop	out	of	the	middle	class	,	but	see	what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	women	and	see	what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	men	.
There	we	go	.
So	watch	that	.	You	see	them	both	drop	out	of	the	middle	class	.
Watch	what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	the	women	.	Watch	what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	the	men	.
The	men	sort	of	 stagn 	 ate 	 	there	,	while	the	women	zoom	up	in	those	 high 	 - 	 skill 	 	jobs	.
So	what	's	that	about	?
It	looks	like	women	got	some	power	boost	on	a	video	game	,	or	like	they	 s 	 nuck 	 	in	some	secret	serum	into	their	 birth 	 - 	 control 	 	pills	that	lets	them	shoot	up	high	.
But	of	course	,	it	's	not	about	that	.
What	it	's	about	is	that	the	economy	has	changed	a	lot	.
We	used	to	have	a	manufacturing	economy	,	which	was	about	building	goods	and	products	,	and	now	we	have	a	service	economy	and	an	information	and	creative	economy	.
Those	two	 economie 	 s 	 	require	very	different	skills	,	and	as	it	 happen 	 s 	 	,	women	have	been	much	better	at	 acquir 	 ing 	 	the	new	set	of	skills	than	men	have	been	.
It	used	to	be	that	you	were	a	guy	who	went	to	high	school	who	did	n't	have	a	college	degree	,	but	you	had	a	specific	set	of	skills	,	and	with	the	help	of	a	union	,	you	could	make	yourself	a	pretty	good	 middle 	 - 	 class 	 	life	.
But	that	 re 	 ally 	 	is	n't	true	 any 	 more 	 	.
This	new	economy	is	pretty	 in 	 different 	 	to	size	and	strength	,	which	is	what	's	 help 	 ed 	 	men	along	all	these	years	.
What	the	economy	 require 	 s 	 	now	is	a	whole	different	set	of	skills	.
You	 bas 	 ically 	 	need	intelligence	,	you	need	an	ability	to	sit	still	and	focus	,	to	communicate	 open 	 ly 	 	,	to	be	able	to	listen	to	people	and	to	operate	in	a	workplace	that	is	much	more	fluid	than	it	used	to	be	,	and	those	are	things	that	women	do	 extreme 	 ly 	 	well	,	as	we	're	seeing	.
If	you	look	at	management	theory	these	days	,	it	used	to	be	that	our	ideal	leader	 sound 	 ed 	 	something	like	General	Patton	,	right	?
You	would	be	 issu 	 ing 	 	orders	from	above	.
You	would	be	very	hierarchical	.
You	would	tell	everyone	below	you	what	to	do	.
But	that	's	not	what	an	ideal	leader	is	like	now	.
If	you	read	management	books	now	,	a	leader	is	 some 	 body 	 	who	can	foster	creativity	,	who	can	get	his	--	get	the	employees	--	see	,	I	still	say	``	his	''	--	who	can	get	the	employees	to	talk	to	each	other	,	who	can	 bas 	 ically 	 	build	teams	and	get	them	to	be	creative	.
And	those	are	all	things	that	women	do	very	well	.
And	then	on	top	of	that	,	that	's	created	a	kind	of	 casca 	 ding 	 	effect	.
Women	enter	the	workplace	at	the	top	,	and	then	at	the	working	class	,	all	the	new	jobs	that	are	created	are	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	jobs	that	wives	used	to	do	for	free	at	home	.
So	that	's	 child 	 care 	 	,	elder	care	and	food	preparation	.
So	those	are	all	the	jobs	that	are	growing	,	and	those	are	jobs	that	women	tend	to	do	.
Now	one	day	it	might	be	that	mothers	will	hire	an	 out 	 - 	 of 	 - 	 work 	 	,	 middle 	 - 	 aged 	 	,	former	 steel 	 worker 	 	guy	to	watch	their	children	at	home	,	and	that	would	be	good	for	the	men	,	but	that	has	n't	quite	happened	yet	.
To	see	what	's	going	to	happen	,	you	ca	n't	just	look	at	the	workforce	that	is	now	,	you	have	to	look	at	our	future	workforce	.
And	here	the	story	is	 fair 	 ly 	 	simple	.
Women	are	getting	college	degrees	at	a	faster	rate	than	men	.
Why	?	This	is	a	real	mystery	.
People	have	asked	men	,	why	do	n't	they	just	go	back	to	college	,	to	community	college	,	say	,	and	 re 	 tool 	 	themselves	,	learn	a	new	set	of	skills	?
Well	it	turns	out	that	they	're	just	very	 un 	 comfortabl 	 e 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	that	.
They	're	used	to	thinking	of	themselves	as	 provider 	 s 	 	,	and	they	ca	n't	seem	to	build	the	social	networks	that	allow	them	to	get	through	college	.
So	for	some	reason	men	just	do	n't	end	up	going	back	to	college	.
And	what	's	even	more	 disturb 	 ing 	 	is	what	's	happening	with	younger	boys	.
There	's	been	about	a	decade	of	research	about	what	people	are	calling	the	``	boy	crisis	.	''
Now	the	boy	crisis	is	this	idea	that	very	young	boys	,	for	whatever	reason	,	are	 do 	 ing 	 	worse	in	school	than	very	young	girls	,	and	people	have	theories	about	that	.
Is	it	because	we	have	an	 excess 	 ively 	 	verbal	curriculum	,	and	little	girls	are	better	at	that	than	little	boys	?
Or	that	we	require	kids	to	sit	still	too	much	,	and	so	boys	 initial 	 ly 	 	feel	like	failures	?
And	some	people	say	it	's	because	,	in	9th	grade	,	boys	start	dropping	out	of	school	.
Because	I	'm	writing	a	book	about	all	this	,	I	'm	still	looking	into	it	,	so	I	do	n't	have	the	answer	.
But	in	the	mean	time	,	I	'm	going	to	call	on	the	worldwide	education	expert	,	who	's	my	10-year-old	daughter	,	Noah	,	to	talk	to	you	about	why	the	boys	in	her	class	do	worse	.
Noah	:	The	girls	are	 obvious 	 ly 	 	 smart 	 er 	 	.
I	mean	they	have	much	larger	vocabulary	.
They	learn	much	faster	.
They	are	more	controlled	.
On	the	board	today	for	losing	recess	tomorrow	,	only	boys	.
Hanna	Rosin	:	And	why	is	that	?
Noah	:	Why	?	They	were	just	not	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	the	class	while	the	girls	sat	there	very	 nice 	 ly 	 	.
HR	:	So	there	you	go	.
This	whole	thesis	 re 	 ally 	 	came	home	to	me	when	I	went	to	visit	a	college	in	Kansas	City	--	 working 	 - 	 class 	 	college	.
 Certain 	 ly 	 	,	when	I	was	in	college	,	I	had	certain	 expectation 	 s 	 	about	my	life	--	that	my	husband	and	I	would	both	work	,	and	that	we	would	 e 	 qually 	 	raise	the	children	.
But	these	college	girls	had	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	view	of	their	future	.
Basically	,	the	way	they	said	it	to	me	is	that	they	would	be	working	18	hours	a	day	,	that	their	husband	would	maybe	have	a	job	,	but	that	mostly	he	would	be	at	home	taking	care	of	the	 kiddi 	 es 	 	.
And	this	was	kind	of	a	 shock 	 er 	 	to	me	.
And	then	here	's	my	 favorit 	 e 	 	quote	from	one	of	the	girls	:	``	Men	are	the	new	ball	and	chain	.	''
Now	you	laugh	,	but	that	quote	has	kind	of	a	sting	to	it	,	right	?
And	I	think	the	reason	it	has	a	sting	is	because	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	years	of	history	do	n't	reverse	themselves	without	a	lot	of	pain	,	and	that	's	why	I	talk	about	us	all	going	through	this	together	.
The	night	after	I	talked	to	these	college	girls	,	I	also	went	to	a	men	's	group	in	Kansas	,	and	these	were	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	kind	of	victims	of	the	manufacturing	economy	which	I	spoke	to	you	about	earlier	.
They	were	men	who	had	been	 contractor 	 s 	 	,	or	they	had	been	building	houses	and	they	had	lost	their	jobs	after	the	housing	boom	,	and	they	were	in	this	group	because	they	were	failing	to	pay	their	child	support	.
And	the	instructor	was	up	there	in	the	class	 explain 	 ing 	 	to	them	all	the	ways	in	which	they	had	lost	their	identity	in	this	new	age	.
He	was	telling	them	they	no	 long 	 er 	 	had	any	moral	authority	,	that	nobody	needed	them	for	emotional	support	 any 	 more 	 	,	and	they	were	not	 re 	 ally 	 	the	 provider 	 s 	 	.
So	who	were	they	?
And	this	was	very	 dishearten 	 ing 	 	for	them	.
And	what	he	did	was	he	wrote	down	on	the	board	``	$	85,000	,	''	and	he	said	,	``	That	's	her	salary	,	''	and	then	he	wrote	down	``	$	12,000	.	''
``	That	's	your	salary	.
So	who	's	the	man	now	?	''	he	asked	them	.
``	Who	's	the	damn	man	?
She	's	the	man	now	.	''
And	that	 re 	 ally 	 	sent	a	shudder	through	the	room	.
And	that	's	part	of	the	reason	I	like	to	talk	about	this	,	because	I	think	it	can	be	pretty	 pain 	 ful 	 	,	and	we	 re 	 ally 	 	have	to	work	through	it	.
And	the	other	reason	it	's	kind	of	urgent	is	because	it	's	not	just	happening	in	the	 U 	 .S 	 	.
It	's	happening	all	over	the	world	.
In	India	,	poor	women	are	learning	English	faster	than	their	male	counterparts	in	order	to	staff	the	new	call	centers	that	are	growing	in	India	.
In	China	,	a	lot	of	the	opening	up	of	private	 entrepreneur 	 ship 	 	is	happening	because	women	are	starting	businesses	,	small	businesses	,	faster	than	men	.
And	here	's	my	 favorit 	 e 	 	example	,	which	is	in	South	Korea	.
Over	several	decades	,	South	Korea	built	one	of	the	most	 patriarch 	 al 	 	societies	we	know	about	.
They	 bas 	 ically 	 	 enshrine 	 d 	 	the	 second 	 - 	 class 	 	status	of	women	in	the	civil	code	.
And	if	women	failed	to	birth	male	children	,	they	were	 bas 	 ically 	 	treated	like	domestic	servants	.
And	sometimes	family	would	pray	to	the	 spirit 	 s 	 	to	kill	off	a	girl	child	so	they	could	have	a	male	child	.
But	over	the	'70s	and	'80s	,	the	South	Korea	government	decided	they	wanted	to	rapidly	 industrial 	 ize 	 	,	and	so	what	they	did	was	,	they	started	to	push	women	into	the	workforce	.
Now	they	've	been	 as 	 king 	 	a	question	since	1985	:	``	How	 strong 	 ly 	 	do	you	prefer	a	 first 	 - 	 born 	 	son	?	''
And	now	look	at	the	chart	.
That	's	from	1985	to	2003	.
How	much	do	you	prefer	a	 first 	 - 	 born 	 	son	?
So	you	can	see	that	these	economic	changes	 re 	 ally 	 	do	have	a	strong	effect	on	our	culture	.
Now	because	we	have	n't	fully	processed	this	information	,	it	's	kind	of	coming	back	to	us	in	our	pop	culture	in	these	kind	of	weird	and	 exaggerat 	 ed 	 	ways	,	where	you	can	see	that	the	 stereotype 	 s 	 	are	changing	.
And	so	we	have	on	the	male	side	what	one	of	my	 colleague 	 s 	 	 like 	 s 	 	to	call	the	``	omega	males	''	popping	up	,	who	are	the	males	who	are	 romantic 	 ally 	 	 challenge 	 d 	 	losers	who	ca	n't	find	a	job	.
And	they	come	up	in	lots	of	different	forms	.
So	we	have	the	perpetual	adolescent	.
We	have	the	 charm 	 less 	 	 misan 	 thrope 	 	.
Then	we	have	our	Bud	Light	guy	who	's	the	happy	couch	potato	.
And	then	here	's	a	 shock 	 er 	 	:	even	America	's	most	 sex 	 iest 	 	man	alive	,	the	 sex 	 iest 	 	man	alive	 get 	 s 	 	 romantic 	 ally 	 	played	these	days	in	a	movie	.
And	then	on	the	female	side	,	you	have	the	opposite	,	in	which	you	have	these	crazy	superhero	women	.
You	've	got	Lady	Gaga	.
You	've	got	our	new	James	Bond	,	who	's	 Angel 	 ina 	 	 Joli 	 e 	 	.
And	it	's	not	just	for	the	young	,	right	?
Even	Helen	 Mir 	 ren 	 	can	hold	a	gun	these	days	.
And	so	it	 feel 	 s 	 	like	we	have	to	move	from	this	place	where	we	've	got	these	 uber 	 - 	 exaggerat 	 ed 	 	images	into	something	that	 feel 	 s 	 	a	little	more	normal	.
So	for	a	long	time	in	the	economic	sphere	,	we	've	lived	with	the	term	``	glass	ceiling	.	''
Now	I	've	never	 re 	 ally 	 	 like 	 d 	 	this	term	.
For	one	thing	,	it	puts	men	and	women	in	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 antagonist 	 ic 	 	relationship	with	one	another	,	because	the	men	are	these	 devi 	 ous 	 	 trick 	 sters 	 	up	there	who	've	put	up	this	glass	ceiling	.
And	we	're	always	below	the	glass	ceiling	,	the	women	.
And	we	have	a	lot	of	skill	and	experience	,	but	it	's	a	trick	,	so	how	are	you	 s 	 upposed 	 	to	prepare	to	get	through	that	glass	ceiling	?
And	also	,	``	shattering	the	glass	ceiling	''	is	a	terrible	phrase	.
would	pop	their	head	through	a	glass	ceiling	?
So	the	image	that	I	like	to	think	of	,	instead	of	glass	ceiling	,	is	the	high	bridge	.
It	's	 definite 	 ly 	 	 terr 	 ifying 	 	to	stand	at	the	foot	of	a	high	bridge	,	but	it	's	also	pretty	 exhila 	 rating 	 	,	because	it	's	beautiful	up	there	,	and	you	're	looking	out	on	a	beautiful	view	.
And	the	great	thing	is	there	's	no	trick	like	with	the	glass	ceiling	.
There	's	no	man	or	woman	standing	in	the	middle	about	to	cut	the	cables	.
There	's	no	hole	in	the	middle	that	you	're	going	to	fall	through	.
And	the	great	thing	is	that	you	can	take	 any 	 one 	 	along	with	you	.
You	can	bring	your	husband	along	.
You	can	bring	your	friends	,	or	your	 colleague 	 s 	 	,	or	your	 babysit 	 ter 	 	to	walk	along	with	you	.
And	 husband 	 s 	 	can	drag	their	wives	across	,	if	their	wives	do	n't	feel	ready	.
But	the	point	about	the	high	bridge	is	that	you	have	to	have	the	confidence	to	know	that	you	 de 	 serve 	 	to	be	on	that	bridge	,	that	you	have	all	the	skills	and	experience	you	need	in	order	to	walk	across	the	high	bridge	,	but	you	just	have	to	make	the	decision	to	take	the	first	step	and	do	it	.
Thanks	very	much	.

Leah	 Buech 	 ley 	 	:	How	to	 “ 	 sketch 	 ” 	 	with	electronics
Today	,	I	'm	going	to	talk	to	you	about	 sketch 	 ing 	 	electronics	.
I	'm	,	among	several	other	things	,	an	electrical	engineer	,	and	that	means	that	I	spend	a	good	amount	of	time	 design 	 ing 	 	and	building	new	pieces	of	technology	,	and	more	 s 	 pecifically 	 	 design 	 ing 	 	and	building	electronics	.
And	what	I	've	found	is	that	the	process	of	 design 	 ing 	 	and	building	electronics	is	problematic	in	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	ways	.
So	it	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	slow	process	,	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	expensive	,	and	the	outcome	of	that	process	,	 name 	 ly 	 	electronic	circuit	boards	,	are	limited	in	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	kind	of	 interest 	 ing 	 	ways	.
So	they	're	 re 	 ally 	 	small	,	generally	,	they	're	square	and	flat	and	hard	,	and	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	most	of	them	just	are	n't	very	attractive	,	and	so	my	team	and	I	have	been	thinking	of	ways	to	 re 	 ally 	 	change	and	mix	up	the	process	and	the	outcome	of	 design 	 ing 	 	electronics	.
And	so	what	if	you	could	design	and	build	electronics	like	this	?	So	what	if	you	could	do	it	 extreme 	 ly 	 	quickly	,	 extreme 	 ly 	 	 in 	 expensive 	 ly 	 	,	and	maybe	more	 interest 	 ingly 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 fluid 	 ly 	 	and	 express 	 ively 	 	and	even	 improvisation 	 ally 	 	?
Would	n't	that	be	so	cool	,	and	that	would	n't	that	open	up	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	new	 possibilit 	 ies 	 	?
I	'm	going	to	share	with	you	two	projects	that	are	 investigation 	 s 	 	along	these	lines	,	and	we	'll	start	with	this	one	.
Magnetic	electronic	pieces	and	ferrous	paper	.
A	conductive	pen	from	the	Lewis	lab	at	 U 	 IUC 	 	.
Sticker	 template 	 s 	 	.
Speed	x	4	.
Making	a	switch	.
Music	:	DJ	Shadow	.
Adding	some	intelligence	with	a	 micro 	 controller 	 	.
 Sketch 	 ing 	 	an	interface	.
Pretty	cool	,	 hu 	 h 	 	?	We	think	so	.
So	now	that	we	developed	these	tools	and	found	these	materials	that	let	us	do	these	things	,	we	started	to	 realiz 	 e 	 	that	,	 essential 	 ly 	 	,	anything	that	we	can	do	with	paper	,	anything	that	we	can	do	with	a	piece	of	paper	and	a	pen	we	can	now	do	with	electronics	.
So	the	next	project	that	I	want	to	show	you	is	kind	of	a	 deep 	 er 	 	exploration	of	that	possibility	.
And	I	'll	kind	of	let	it	speak	for	itself	.
So	the	next	step	for	us	in	this	process	is	now	to	find	a	way	to	let	all	of	you	build	things	like	this	,	and	so	the	way	that	we	're	 approach 	 ing 	 	that	is	by	teaching	workshops	to	people	where	we	explain	how	they	can	use	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	tools	,	and	then	also	working	to	get	the	tools	and	the	materials	and	techniques	out	into	the	real	world	in	a	variety	of	ways	.
And	so	 some 	 time 	 	soon	,	you	'll	be	able	to	play	and	build	and	sketch	with	electronics	in	this	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	new	way	.
So	thank	you	very	much	.

The	world	's	population	will	grow	to	9	billion	over	the	next	50	years	--	and	only	by	raising	the	living	standards	of	the	 poor 	 est 	 	can	we	check	population	growth	.	This	is	the	 paradox 	 ical 	 	answer	that	Hans	 Ros 	 ling 	 	 unveil 	 s 	 	at	TED	@	Cannes	 us 	 ing 	 	 color 	 ful 	 	new	data	display	technology	.

Hans	 Ros 	 ling 	 	on	global	population	growth
I	still	remember	the	day	in	school	when	our	teacher	told	us	that	the	world	population	had	become	three	billion	people	,	and	that	was	in	1960	.
I	'm	going	to	talk	now	about	how	world	population	has	changed	from	that	year	and	into	the	future	,	but	I	will	not	use	digital	technology	,	as	I	've	done	during	my	first	five	 TED 	 Talk 	 s 	 	.
Instead	,	I	have	 progress 	 ed 	 	,	and	I	am	,	today	,	 launch 	 ing 	 	a	brand	new	analog	teaching	technology	that	I	picked	up	from	 IKE 	 A 	 	:	this	box	.
This	box	contains	one	billion	people	.
And	our	teacher	told	us	that	the	 industrial 	 ized 	 	world	,	1960	,	had	one	billion	people	.
In	the	developing	world	,	she	said	,	they	had	two	billion	people	.
And	they	lived	away	then	.
There	was	a	big	gap	between	the	one	billion	in	the	 industrial 	 ized 	 	world	and	the	two	billion	in	the	developing	world	.
In	the	 industrial 	 ized 	 	world	,	people	were	healthy	,	educated	,	rich	,	and	they	had	small	families	.
And	their	aspiration	was	to	buy	a	car	.
And	in	1960	,	all	 Swede 	 s 	 	were	saving	to	try	to	buy	a	Volvo	like	this	.
This	was	the	economic	level	at	which	Sweden	was	.
But	in	contrast	to	this	,	in	the	developing	world	,	far	away	,	the	aspiration	of	the	average	family	there	was	to	have	food	for	the	day	.
They	were	saving	to	be	able	to	buy	a	pair	of	shoes	.
There	was	an	 e 	 normous 	 	gap	in	the	world	when	I	grew	up	.
And	this	gap	between	the	West	and	the	rest	has	created	a	 mind 	 set 	 	of	the	world	,	which	we	still	use	 linguistic 	 ally 	 	when	we	talk	about	``	the	West	''	and	``	the	Developing	World	.	''
But	the	world	has	changed	,	and	it	's	 over 	 due 	 	to	upgrade	that	 mind 	 set 	 	and	that	taxonomy	of	the	world	,	and	to	understand	it	.
And	that	's	what	I	'm	going	to	show	you	,	because	since	1960	what	has	happened	in	the	world	up	to	2010	is	that	a	 stagger 	 ing 	 	four	billion	people	have	been	added	to	the	world	population	.
Just	look	how	many	.
The	world	population	has	 double 	 d 	 	since	I	went	to	school	.
And	of	course	,	there	's	been	economic	growth	in	the	West	.
A	lot	of	companies	have	happened	to	grow	the	economy	,	so	the	Western	population	moved	over	to	here	.
And	now	their	aspiration	is	not	only	to	have	a	car	.
Now	they	want	to	have	a	holiday	on	a	very	remote	destination	and	they	want	to	fly	.
So	this	is	where	they	are	today	.
And	the	most	successful	of	the	developing	countries	,	they	have	moved	on	,	you	know	,	and	they	have	become	emerging	 economie 	 s 	 	,	we	call	them	.
They	are	now	buying	cars	.
And	what	happened	a	month	ago	was	that	the	Chinese	company	,	 Gee 	 ly 	 	,	they	acquired	the	Volvo	company	,	and	then	finally	the	 Swede 	 s 	 	understood	that	something	big	had	happened	in	the	world	.
So	there	they	are	.
And	the	tragedy	is	that	the	two	billion	over	here	that	is	 strugg 	 ling 	 	for	food	and	shoes	,	they	are	still	almost	as	poor	as	they	were	50	years	ago	.
The	new	thing	is	that	we	have	the	biggest	pile	of	 billion 	 s 	 	,	the	three	 billion 	 s 	 	here	,	which	are	also	becoming	emerging	 economie 	 s 	 	,	because	they	are	quite	healthy	,	 relative 	 ly 	 	 well 	 - 	 educated 	 	,	and	they	already	also	have	two	to	three	children	per	woman	,	as	those	[	richer	also	]	have	.
And	their	aspiration	now	is	,	of	course	,	to	buy	a	bicycle	,	and	then	later	on	they	would	like	to	have	a	 motor 	 bike 	 	also	.
But	this	is	the	world	we	have	today	,	no	 long 	 er 	 	any	gap	.
But	the	distance	from	the	 poor 	 est 	 	here	,	the	very	 poor 	 est 	 	,	to	the	very	 rich 	 est 	 	over	here	is	wider	than	ever	.
But	there	is	a	continuous	world	from	walking	,	biking	,	driving	,	flying	--	there	are	people	on	all	levels	,	and	most	people	tend	to	be	 s 	 omewhere 	 	in	the	middle	.
This	is	the	new	world	we	have	today	in	2010	.
And	what	will	happen	in	the	future	?
Well	,	I	'm	going	to	project	into	2050	.
I	was	in	Shanghai	 recent 	 ly 	 	,	and	I	 listen 	 ed 	 	to	what	's	happening	in	China	,	and	it	's	pretty	sure	that	they	will	catch	up	,	just	as	Japan	did	.
All	the	 projection 	 s 	 	[	say	that	]	this	one	[	billion	]	will	[	only	]	grow	with	one	to	two	or	three	percent	.
[	But	this	second	]	 grow 	 s 	 	with	seven	,	eight	percent	,	and	then	they	will	end	up	here	.
They	will	start	flying	.
And	these	lower	or	middle	income	countries	,	the	emerging	income	countries	,	they	will	also	forge	 forward 	 s 	 	 economic 	 ally 	 	.
And	if	,	but	only	if	,	we	invest	in	the	right	green	technology	--	so	that	we	can	avoid	severe	climate	change	,	and	energy	can	still	be	 relative 	 ly 	 	cheap	--	then	they	will	move	all	the	way	up	here	.
And	they	will	start	to	buy	electric	cars	.
This	is	what	we	will	find	there	.
So	what	about	the	 poor 	 est 	 	two	billion	?
What	about	the	 poor 	 est 	 	two	billion	here	?
Will	they	move	on	?
Well	,	here	population	[	growth	]	comes	in	because	there	[	among	emerging	 economie 	 s 	 	]	we	already	have	two	to	three	children	per	woman	,	family	planning	is	 wide 	 ly 	 	used	,	and	population	growth	is	coming	to	an	end	.
Here	[	among	the	 poor 	 est 	 	]	,	population	is	growing	.
So	these	[	 poor 	 est 	 	]	two	billion	will	,	in	the	next	decades	,	increase	to	three	billion	,	and	they	will	thereafter	increase	to	four	billion	.
There	is	nothing	--	but	a	nuclear	war	of	a	kind	we	've	never	seen	--	that	can	stop	this	[	growth	]	from	happening	.
Because	we	already	have	this	[	growth	]	in	process	.
But	if	,	and	only	if	,	[	the	 poor 	 est 	 	]	get	out	of	poverty	,	they	get	education	,	they	get	 improv 	 ed 	 	child	survival	,	they	can	buy	a	bicycle	and	a	cell	phone	and	come	[	to	live	]	here	,	then	population	growth	will	stop	in	2050	.
We	can	not	have	people	on	this	level	looking	for	food	and	shoes	because	then	we	get	continued	population	growth	.
And	let	me	show	you	why	by	 convert 	 ing 	 	back	to	the	 old 	 - 	 time 	 	digital	technology	.
Here	I	have	on	the	screen	my	country	 bubble 	 s 	 	.
Every	bubble	is	a	country	.	The	size	is	population	.
The	colors	show	the	continent	.
The	yellow	on	there	is	the	Americas	;	dark	blue	is	Africa	;	brown	is	Europe	;	green	is	the	Middle	East	and	this	light	blue	is	South	Asia	.
That	's	India	and	this	is	China	.	Size	is	population	.
Here	I	have	children	per	woman	:	two	children	,	four	children	,	six	children	,	eight	children	--	big	families	,	small	families	.
The	year	is	1960	.
And	down	here	,	child	survival	,	the	percentage	of	children	 surviv 	 ing 	 	childhood	up	to	starting	school	:	60	percent	,	70	percent	,	80	percent	,	90	,	and	almost	100	percent	,	as	we	have	today	in	the	 wealth 	 iest 	 	and	 health 	 iest 	 	countries	.
But	look	,	this	is	the	world	my	teacher	talked	about	in	1960	:	one	billion	Western	world	here	--	high	 child 	 - 	 survival 	 	,	small	families	--	and	all	the	rest	,	the	rainbow	of	developing	countries	,	with	very	large	families	and	poor	child	survival	.
What	has	happened	?	I	start	the	world	.	Here	we	go	.
Can	you	see	,	as	the	years	pass	by	,	child	survival	is	increasing	?
They	get	soap	,	hygiene	,	education	,	vaccination	,	penicillin	and	then	family	planning	.	Family	size	is	decreasing	.
[	When	]	they	get	up	to	90-percent	child	survival	,	then	families	decrease	,	and	most	of	the	Arab	countries	in	the	Middle	East	is	 fall 	 ing 	 	down	there	[	to	small	families	]	.
Look	,	Bangladesh	catching	up	with	India	.
The	whole	emerging	world	 join 	 s 	 	the	Western	world	with	good	child	survival	and	small	family	size	,	but	we	still	have	the	 poor 	 est 	 	billion	.
Can	you	see	the	 poor 	 est 	 	billion	,	those	[	two	]	boxes	I	had	over	here	?
They	are	still	up	here	.
And	they	still	have	a	child	survival	of	only	70	to	80	percent	,	meaning	that	if	you	have	six	children	born	,	there	will	be	at	least	four	who	survive	to	the	next	generation	.
And	the	population	will	double	in	one	generation	.
So	the	only	way	of	 re 	 ally 	 	getting	world	population	[	growth	]	to	stop	is	to	continue	to	improve	child	survival	to	90	percent	.
That	's	why	 investment 	 s 	 	by	Gates	Foundation	,	UNICEF	and	aid	organizations	,	together	with	national	government	in	the	 poor 	 est 	 	countries	,	are	so	good	;	because	they	are	actually	 help 	 ing 	 	us	to	reach	a	sustainable	population	size	of	the	world	.
We	can	stop	at	nine	billion	if	we	do	the	right	things	.
Child	survival	is	the	new	green	.
It	's	only	by	child	survival	that	we	will	stop	population	growth	.
And	will	it	happen	?
Well	,	I	'm	not	an	optimist	,	neither	am	I	a	pessimist	.
I	'm	a	very	serious	``	possibilist	.	''
It	's	a	new	category	where	we	take	emotion	apart	,	and	we	just	work	 analytical 	 ly 	 	with	the	world	.
It	can	be	done	.
We	can	have	a	much	more	just	world	.
With	green	technology	and	with	 investment 	 s 	 	to	alleviate	poverty	,	and	global	governance	,	the	world	can	become	like	this	.
And	look	at	the	position	of	the	old	West	.
Remember	when	this	blue	box	was	all	alone	,	leading	the	world	,	living	its	own	life	.
This	will	not	happen	[	again	]	.
The	role	of	the	old	West	in	the	new	world	is	to	become	the	foundation	of	the	modern	world	--	nothing	more	,	nothing	less	.
But	it	's	a	very	important	role	.
Do	it	well	and	get	used	to	it	.
Thank	you	very	much	.

 Stefan 	 a 	 	Broadbent	:	How	the	Internet	 en 	 ables 	 	intimacy
I	believe	that	there	are	new	,	hidden	 tension 	 s 	 	that	are	actually	happening	between	people	and	institutions	--	institutions	that	are	the	institutions	that	people	inhabit	in	their	daily	life	:	schools	,	 hospital 	 s 	 	,	 workplace 	 s 	 	,	factories	,	offices	,	etc	.
And	something	that	I	see	happening	is	something	that	I	would	like	to	call	a	sort	of	``	 democrat 	 ization 	 	of	intimacy	.	''
And	what	do	I	mean	by	that	?
I	mean	that	what	people	are	 do 	 ing 	 	is	,	in	fact	,	they	are	sort	of	,	with	their	communication	channels	,	they	are	breaking	an	imposed	isolation	that	these	institutions	are	 impos 	 ing 	 	on	them	.
How	are	they	 do 	 ing 	 	this	?	They	're	 do 	 ing 	 	it	in	a	very	simple	way	,	by	calling	their	mom	from	work	,	by	 IM 	 ing 	 	from	their	office	to	their	friends	,	by	 text 	 ing 	 	under	the	desk	.
The	pictures	that	you	're	seeing	behind	me	are	people	that	I	visited	in	the	last	few	months	.
And	I	asked	them	to	come	along	with	the	person	they	communicate	with	most	.
And	 some 	 body 	 	brought	a	 boy 	 friend 	 	,	 some 	 body 	 	a	father	.
One	young	woman	brought	her	grandfather	.
For	20	years	,	I	've	been	looking	at	how	people	use	channels	such	as	email	,	the	mobile	phone	,	 text 	 ing 	 	,	etc	.
What	we	're	actually	going	to	see	is	that	,	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	,	people	are	communicating	on	a	regular	basis	with	five	,	six	,	seven	of	their	most	 in 	 timate 	 	sphere	.
Now	,	lets	take	some	data	.	Facebook	.
Recently	some	 sociologist 	 s 	 	from	Facebook	--	Facebook	is	the	channel	that	you	would	expect	is	the	most	 enlarge 	 ning 	 	of	all	channels	.
And	an	average	user	,	said	Cameron	Marlow	,	from	Facebook	,	has	about	120	friends	.
But	he	actually	talks	to	,	has	 two 	 - 	 way 	 	 exchange 	 s 	 	with	,	about	four	to	six	people	on	a	regular	base	,	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	his	gender	.
Academic	research	on	instant	messaging	also	shows	100	people	on	buddy	lists	,	but	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	people	chat	with	two	,	three	,	four	--	 any 	 way 	 	,	less	than	five	.
My	own	research	on	 cell 	 phones 	 	and	voice	calls	shows	that	80	percent	of	the	calls	are	actually	made	to	four	people	.	80	percent	.
And	when	you	go	to	Skype	,	it	's	down	to	two	people	.
A	lot	of	 sociologist 	 s 	 	actually	are	quite	 disappoint 	 ed 	 	.
I	mean	,	I	've	been	a	bit	 disappoint 	 ed 	 	sometimes	when	I	saw	this	data	and	all	this	deployment	,	just	for	five	people	.
And	some	 sociologist 	 s 	 	actually	feel	that	it	's	a	closure	,	it	's	a	 cocoon 	 ing 	 	,	that	we	're	 disengag 	 ing 	 	from	the	public	.
And	I	would	actually	,	I	would	like	to	show	you	that	if	we	actually	look	at	who	is	 do 	 ing 	 	it	,	and	from	where	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	it	,	actually	there	is	an	 incredibl 	 e 	 	social	transformation	.
There	are	three	stories	that	I	think	are	quite	good	examples	.
The	first	gentleman	,	he	's	a	baker	.
And	so	he	starts	working	every	morning	at	four	o'clock	in	the	morning	.
And	around	eight	o'clock	he	sort	of	 sneak 	 s 	 	away	from	his	oven	,	 clean 	 s 	 	his	hands	from	the	flour	and	calls	his	wife	.
He	just	 want 	 s 	 	to	wish	her	a	good	day	,	because	that	's	the	start	of	her	day	.
And	I	've	heard	this	story	a	number	of	times	.
A	young	factory	worker	who	works	night	shifts	,	who	 manage 	 s 	 	to	sneak	away	from	the	factory	floor	,	where	there	is	CCTV	by	the	way	,	and	find	a	corner	,	where	at	11	o'clock	at	night	he	can	call	his	girlfriend	and	just	say	 good 	 night 	 	.
Or	a	mother	who	,	at	four	o'clock	,	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 manage 	 s 	 	to	find	a	corner	in	the	toilet	to	check	that	her	children	are	 safe 	 ly 	 	home	.
Then	there	is	another	couple	,	there	is	a	Brazilian	couple	.
They	've	lived	in	Italy	for	a	number	of	years	.
They	Skype	with	their	families	a	few	times	a	week	.
But	once	a	fortnight	,	they	actually	put	the	computer	on	their	dining	table	,	pull	out	the	 web 	 cam 	 	and	actually	have	dinner	with	their	family	in	Sao	Paulo	.	And	they	have	a	big	event	of	it	.
And	I	heard	this	story	the	first	time	a	couple	of	years	ago	from	a	very	modest	family	of	 immigrant 	 s 	 	from	Kosovo	in	Switzerland	.
They	had	set	up	a	big	screen	in	their	living	room	,	and	every	morning	they	had	breakfast	with	their	grandmother	.
But	Danny	Miller	,	who	is	a	very	good	anthropologist	who	is	working	on	 Filipin 	 a 	 	migrant	women	who	leave	their	children	back	in	the	Philippines	,	was	telling	me	about	how	much	 parent 	 ing 	 	is	going	on	through	Skype	,	and	how	much	these	mothers	are	engaged	with	their	children	through	Skype	.
And	then	there	is	the	third	couple	.	They	are	two	friends	.
They	chat	to	each	other	every	day	,	a	few	times	a	day	actually	.
And	finally	,	finally	,	they	've	managed	to	put	instant	messaging	on	their	computers	at	work	.
And	now	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	they	have	it	open	.
Whenever	they	have	a	moment	they	chat	to	each	other	.
And	this	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	we	've	been	seeing	with	 teenager 	 s 	 	and	kids	 do 	 ing 	 	it	in	school	,	under	the	table	,	and	 text 	 ing 	 	under	the	table	to	their	friends	.
So	,	none	of	these	cases	are	unique	.
I	mean	,	I	could	tell	you	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	them	.
But	what	is	 re 	 ally 	 	exceptional	is	the	setting	.
So	,	think	of	the	three	settings	I	've	talked	to	you	about	:	factory	,	migration	,	office	.
But	it	could	be	in	a	school	,	it	could	be	an	administration	,	it	could	be	a	hospital	.
Three	settings	that	,	if	we	just	step	back	15	years	,	if	you	just	think	back	15	years	,	when	you	 clock 	 ed 	 	in	,	when	you	 clock 	 ed 	 	in	to	an	office	,	when	you	 clock 	 ed 	 	in	to	a	factory	,	there	was	no	contact	for	the	whole	duration	of	the	time	,	there	was	no	contact	with	your	private	sphere	.
If	you	were	lucky	there	was	a	public	phone	hanging	in	the	corridor	or	 s 	 omewhere 	 	.
If	you	were	in	management	,	oh	,	that	was	a	different	story	.
Maybe	you	had	a	direct	line	.
If	you	were	not	,	you	maybe	had	to	go	through	an	operator	.
But	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	when	you	walked	into	those	buildings	,	the	private	sphere	was	left	behind	you	.
And	this	has	become	such	a	norm	of	our	professional	lives	,	such	a	norm	and	such	an	expectation	.
And	it	had	nothing	to	do	with	technical	capability	.
The	phones	were	there	.	But	the	expectation	was	once	you	moved	in	there	your	commitment	was	fully	to	the	task	at	hand	,	fully	to	the	people	around	you	.
That	was	where	the	focus	had	to	be	.
And	this	has	become	such	a	cultural	norm	that	we	actually	school	our	children	for	them	to	be	capable	to	do	this	cleavage	.
If	you	think	nursery	,	kindergarten	,	first	years	of	school	are	just	dedicated	to	take	away	the	children	,	to	make	them	used	to	 stay 	 ing 	 	long	hours	away	from	their	family	.
And	then	the	school	 en 	 acts 	 	 perfect 	 ly 	 	well	.
It	 mimic 	 s 	 	 perfect 	 ly 	 	all	the	 ritual 	 s 	 	that	we	will	find	in	offices	:	 ritual 	 s 	 	of	entry	,	 ritual 	 s 	 	of	exit	,	the	 schedule 	 s 	 	,	the	 uniform 	 s 	 	in	this	country	,	things	that	identify	you	,	 team 	 - 	 building 	 	activities	,	team	building	that	will	allow	you	to	 bas 	 ically 	 	be	with	a	random	group	of	kids	,	or	a	random	group	of	people	that	you	will	have	to	be	with	for	a	number	of	time	.
And	of	course	,	the	major	thing	:	learn	to	pay	attention	,	to	concentrate	and	focus	your	attention	.
This	only	started	about	150	years	ago	.
It	only	started	with	the	birth	of	modern	 bureau 	 cracy 	 	,	and	of	industrial	revolution	.
When	people	 bas 	 ically 	 	had	to	go	 s 	 omewhere 	 	else	to	work	and	carry	out	the	work	.
And	when	with	modern	 bureau 	 cracy 	 	there	was	a	very	rational	approach	,	where	there	was	a	clear	distinction	between	the	private	sphere	and	the	public	sphere	.
So	,	until	then	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	people	were	living	on	top	of	their	trades	.
They	were	living	on	top	of	the	land	they	were	 labor 	 ing 	 	.
They	were	living	on	top	of	the	workshops	where	they	were	working	.
And	if	you	think	,	it	's	 permeat 	 ed 	 	our	whole	culture	,	even	our	cities	.
If	you	think	of	medieval	cities	,	medieval	cities	the	 borough 	 s 	 	all	have	the	names	of	the	guilds	and	 profession 	 s 	 	that	lived	there	.
Now	we	have	 sprawl 	 ing 	 	residential	 suburbi 	 as 	 	that	are	well	distinct	from	production	areas	and	commercial	areas	.
And	actually	,	over	these	150	years	,	there	has	been	a	very	clear	class	system	that	also	has	 e 	 merged 	 	.
So	the	lower	the	status	of	the	job	and	of	the	person	carrying	out	,	the	more	removed	he	would	be	from	his	personal	sphere	.
People	have	taken	this	amazing	possibility	of	actually	being	in	contact	all	through	the	day	or	in	all	types	of	 situation 	 s 	 	.
And	they	are	 do 	 ing 	 	it	 massive 	 ly 	 	.
The	Pew	Institute	,	which	produces	good	data	on	a	regular	basis	on	,	for	instance	,	in	the	States	,	says	that	--	and	I	think	that	this	number	is	conservative	--	50	percent	of	 any 	 body 	 	with	email	access	at	work	is	actually	 do 	 ing 	 	private	email	from	his	office	.
I	 re 	 ally 	 	think	that	the	number	is	conservative	.
In	my	own	research	,	we	saw	that	the	peak	for	private	email	is	actually	11	o'clock	in	the	morning	,	whatever	the	country	.
75	percent	of	people	admit	 do 	 ing 	 	private	 conversation 	 s 	 	from	work	on	their	mobile	phones	.
100	percent	are	 us 	 ing 	 	text	.
The	point	is	that	this	 re 	 - 	 appropriation 	 	of	the	personal	sphere	is	not	 terri 	 bly 	 	successful	with	all	institutions	.
I	'm	always	 surpris 	 ed 	 	the	U.S.	Army	 sociologist 	 s 	 	are	 discuss 	 ing 	 	of	the	impact	for	instance	,	of	soldiers	in	Iraq	having	daily	contact	with	their	families	.
But	there	are	many	institutions	that	are	actually	blocking	this	access	.
And	every	day	,	every	single	day	,	I	read	news	that	makes	me	cringe	,	like	a	$	15	fine	to	kids	in	Texas	,	for	 us 	 ing 	 	,	every	time	they	take	out	their	mobile	phone	in	school	.
Immediate	dismissal	to	bus	drivers	in	New	York	,	if	seen	with	a	mobile	phone	in	a	hand	.
Companies	blocking	access	to	IM	or	to	Facebook	.
Behind	issues	of	security	and	safety	,	which	have	always	been	the	arguments	for	social	control	,	in	fact	what	is	going	on	is	that	these	institutions	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	decide	who	,	in	fact	,	has	a	right	to	self	determine	their	attention	,	to	decide	,	whether	they	should	,	or	not	,	be	isolated	.
And	they	are	actually	 try 	 ing 	 	to	block	,	in	a	certain	sense	,	this	movement	of	a	greater	possibility	of	intimacy	.

Anthony	Atala	on	growing	new	organs
This	is	actually	a	painting	that	 hang 	 s 	 	at	the	 Count 	 way 	 	Library	at	Harvard	Medical	School	.
And	it	shows	the	first	time	an	organ	was	ever	 transplant 	 ed 	 	.
In	the	front	,	you	see	,	actually	,	Joe	Murray	getting	the	patient	ready	for	the	transplant	,	while	in	the	back	room	you	see	Hartwell	Harrison	,	the	Chief	of	 Ur 	 ology 	 	at	Harvard	,	actually	harvesting	the	kidney	.
The	kidney	was	 inde 	 ed 	 	the	first	organ	ever	to	be	 transplant 	 ed 	 	to	the	human	.
That	was	back	in	1954	,	55	years	ago	.
Yet	we	're	still	dealing	with	a	lot	of	the	same	challenges	as	many	decades	ago	.
 Certain 	 ly 	 	many	 advance 	 s 	 	,	many	lives	saved	.
But	we	have	a	major	shortage	of	organs	.
In	the	last	decade	the	number	of	patients	waiting	for	a	transplant	has	 double 	 d 	 	.
While	,	at	the	same	time	,	the	actual	number	of	 transplant 	 s 	 	has	remained	almost	 entire 	 ly 	 	flat	.
That	 re 	 ally 	 	has	to	do	with	our	aging	population	.
We	're	just	getting	older	.
Medicine	is	 do 	 ing 	 	a	better	job	of	keeping	us	alive	.
But	as	we	age	,	our	organs	tend	to	fail	more	.
So	,	that	's	a	challenge	,	not	just	for	organs	but	also	for	 tissue 	 s 	 	.
Trying	to	replace	 pancrea 	 s 	 	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	replace	nerves	that	can	help	us	with	Parkinson	's	.
These	are	major	issues	.
This	is	actually	a	very	stunning	statistic	.
Every	30	seconds	a	patient	dies	from	diseases	that	could	be	treated	with	tissue	regeneration	or	replacement	.
So	,	what	can	we	do	about	it	?
We	've	talked	about	stem	cells	tonight	.
That	's	a	way	to	do	it	.
But	still	ways	to	go	to	get	stem	cells	into	patients	,	in	terms	of	actual	therapies	for	organs	.
Would	n't	it	be	great	if	our	bodies	could	 re 	 generate 	 	?
Would	n't	it	be	great	if	we	could	actually	harness	the	power	of	our	bodies	,	to	actually	heal	 our 	 selves 	 	?
It	's	not	 re 	 ally 	 	that	foreign	of	a	concept	,	actually	;	it	 happen 	 s 	 	on	the	Earth	every	day	.
This	is	actually	a	picture	of	a	salamander	.
 Salamander 	 s 	 	have	this	amazing	capacity	to	 re 	 generate 	 	.
You	see	here	a	little	video	.
This	is	actually	a	limb	injury	in	this	salamander	.
And	this	is	actually	real	photography	,	 time 	 d 	 	photography	,	showing	how	that	limb	 regenera 	 tes 	 	in	a	period	of	days	.
You	see	the	scar	form	.
And	that	scar	actually	 grow 	 s 	 	out	a	new	limb	.
So	,	 salamander 	 s 	 	can	do	it	.
Why	ca	n't	we	?	Why	ca	n't	humans	 re 	 generate 	 	?
Actually	,	we	can	 re 	 generate 	 	.
Your	body	has	many	organs	and	every	single	organ	in	your	body	has	a	cell	population	that	's	ready	to	take	over	at	the	time	of	injury	.	It	 happen 	 s 	 	every	day	.
As	you	age	,	as	you	get	older	.
Your	bones	 re 	 generate 	 	every	10	years	.
Your	skin	 regenera 	 tes 	 	every	two	weeks	.
So	,	your	body	is	 constant 	 ly 	 	 re 	 generating 	 	.
The	challenge	occurs	when	there	is	an	injury	.
At	the	time	of	injury	or	disease	,	the	body	's	first	reaction	is	to	seal	itself	off	from	the	rest	of	the	body	.
It	 bas 	 ically 	 	 want 	 s 	 	to	fight	off	infection	,	and	seal	itself	,	whether	it	's	organs	inside	your	body	,	or	your	skin	,	the	first	reaction	is	for	scar	tissue	to	move	in	,	to	seal	itself	off	from	the	outside	.
So	,	how	can	we	harness	that	power	?
One	of	the	ways	that	we	do	that	is	actually	by	 us 	 ing 	 	smart	 bio 	 materials 	 	.
How	does	this	work	?	Well	,	on	the	left	side	here	you	see	a	urethra	which	was	injured	.
This	is	the	channel	that	 connect 	 s 	 	the	bladder	to	the	outside	of	the	body	.
And	you	see	that	it	is	injured	.
We	 bas 	 ically 	 	found	out	that	you	can	use	these	smart	 bio 	 materials 	 	that	you	can	actually	use	as	a	bridge	.
If	you	build	that	bridge	,	and	you	close	off	from	the	outside	environment	,	then	you	can	create	that	bridge	,	and	cells	that	 re 	 generate 	 	in	your	body	,	can	then	cross	that	bridge	,	and	take	that	path	.
That	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	you	see	here	.
It	's	actually	a	smart	 bio 	 material 	 	that	we	used	,	to	actually	treat	this	patient	.
This	was	an	injured	urethra	on	the	left	side	.
We	used	that	 bio 	 material 	 	in	the	middle	.
And	then	,	six	months	later	on	the	 right 	 - 	 hand 	 	side	you	see	this	 re 	 engineered 	 	urethra	.
 Turn 	 s 	 	out	your	body	can	 re 	 generate 	 	,	but	only	for	small	 distance 	 s 	 	.
The	maximum	efficient	distance	for	regeneration	is	only	about	one	centimeter	.
So	,	we	can	use	these	smart	 bio 	 materials 	 	but	only	for	about	one	centimeter	to	bridge	those	gaps	.
So	,	we	do	 re 	 generate 	 	,	but	for	limited	 distance 	 s 	 	.
What	do	we	do	now	,	if	you	have	injury	for	larger	organs	?
What	do	we	do	when	we	have	injuries	for	structures	which	are	much	larger	than	one	centimeter	?
Then	we	can	start	to	use	cells	.
The	strategy	here	,	is	if	a	patient	comes	in	to	us	with	a	 disease 	 d 	 	or	injured	organ	,	you	can	take	a	very	small	piece	of	tissue	from	that	organ	,	less	than	half	the	size	of	a	 post 	 age 	 	stamp	,	you	can	then	tease	that	tissue	apart	,	and	look	at	its	basic	components	,	the	patient	's	own	cells	,	you	take	those	cells	out	,	grow	and	expand	those	cells	outside	the	body	in	large	 quantiti 	 es 	 	,	and	then	we	then	use	scaffold	materials	.
To	the	naked	eye	they	look	like	a	piece	of	your	blouse	,	or	your	shirt	,	but	actually	these	materials	are	 fair 	 ly 	 	complex	and	they	are	designed	to	 degrad 	 e 	 	once	inside	the	body	.
It	 disintegrate 	 s 	 	a	few	months	later	.
It	's	acting	only	as	a	cell	delivery	vehicle	.
It	's	bringing	the	cells	into	the	body	.	It	's	 a 	 llowing 	 	the	cells	to	 re 	 generate 	 	new	tissue	,	and	once	the	tissue	is	 re 	 generated 	 	the	scaffold	goes	away	.
And	that	's	what	we	did	for	this	piece	of	muscle	.
This	is	actually	showing	a	piece	of	muscle	and	how	we	go	through	the	structures	to	actually	engineer	the	muscle	.
We	take	the	cells	,	we	expand	them	,	we	place	the	cells	on	the	scaffold	,	and	we	then	place	the	scaffold	back	into	the	patient	.
But	actually	,	before	placing	the	scaffold	into	the	patient	,	we	actually	exercise	it	.
We	want	to	make	sure	that	we	condition	this	muscle	,	so	that	it	knows	what	to	do	once	we	put	it	into	the	patient	.
That	's	what	you	're	seeing	here	.	You	're	seeing	this	muscle	 bio 	 - 	 reactor 	 	actually	 exerc 	 ising 	 	the	muscle	back	and	forth	.
Okay	.	These	are	flat	structures	that	we	see	here	,	the	muscle	.
What	about	other	structures	?
This	is	actually	an	engineered	blood	vessel	.
Very	similar	to	what	we	just	did	,	but	a	little	bit	more	complex	.
Here	we	take	a	scaffold	,	and	we	 bas 	 ically 	 	--	scaffold	can	be	like	a	piece	of	paper	here	.
And	we	can	then	 tubular 	 ize 	 	this	scaffold	.
And	what	we	do	is	we	,	to	make	a	blood	vessel	,	same	strategy	.
A	blood	vessel	is	made	up	of	two	different	cell	types	.
We	take	muscle	cells	,	we	paste	,	or	coat	the	outside	with	these	muscle	cells	,	very	much	like	baking	a	layer	cake	,	if	you	will	.
You	place	the	muscle	cells	on	the	outside	.
You	place	the	vascular	blood	vessel	lining	cells	on	the	inside	.
You	now	have	your	fully	seeded	scaffold	.
You	're	going	to	place	this	in	an	 oven 	 - 	 like 	 	device	.
It	has	the	same	conditions	as	a	human	body	,	37	degrees	 centi 	 grade 	 	,	95	percent	oxygen	.
You	then	exercise	it	,	as	what	you	saw	on	that	tape	.
And	on	the	right	you	actually	see	a	carotid	 art 	 ery 	 	that	was	engineered	.
This	is	actually	the	 art 	 ery 	 	that	goes	from	your	neck	to	your	brain	.
And	this	is	an	 X 	 - 	 ray 	 	showing	you	the	patent	,	functional	blood	vessel	.
More	complex	structures	such	as	blood	vessels	,	 urethra 	 s 	 	,	which	I	 show 	 ed 	 	you	,	they	're	 definite 	 ly 	 	more	complex	because	you	're	 introduc 	 ing 	 	two	different	cell	types	.
But	they	are	 re 	 ally 	 	acting	mostly	as	 conduit 	 s 	 	.
You	're	 a 	 llowing 	 	fluid	or	air	to	go	through	at	steady	states	.
They	are	not	 n 	 early 	 	as	complex	as	hollow	organs	.
Hollow	organs	have	a	much	higher	degree	of	complexity	,	because	you	're	 as 	 king 	 	these	organs	to	act	on	demand	.
So	,	the	bladder	is	one	such	organ	.
Same	strategy	,	we	take	a	very	small	piece	of	the	bladder	,	less	than	half	the	size	of	a	 post 	 age 	 	stamp	.
We	then	tease	the	tissue	apart	into	its	two	individual	cell	components	,	muscle	,	and	these	bladder	specialized	cells	.
We	grow	the	cells	outside	the	body	in	large	 quantiti 	 es 	 	.
It	takes	about	four	weeks	to	grow	these	cells	from	the	organ	.
We	then	take	a	scaffold	that	we	shape	like	a	bladder	.
We	coat	the	inside	with	these	bladder	lining	cells	.
We	coat	the	outside	with	these	muscle	cells	.
We	place	it	back	into	this	 oven 	 - 	 like 	 	device	.
From	the	time	you	take	that	piece	of	tissue	,	six	to	eight	weeks	later	you	can	put	the	organ	right	back	into	the	patient	.
This	actually	shows	the	scaffold	.
The	material	is	actually	being	coated	with	the	cells	.
When	we	did	the	first	clinical	trial	for	these	patients	we	actually	created	the	scaffold	 s 	 pecifically 	 	for	each	patient	.
We	brought	patients	in	,	six	to	eight	weeks	prior	to	their	scheduled	surgery	,	did	 X 	 - 	 rays 	 	,	and	we	then	composed	a	scaffold	 s 	 pecifically 	 	for	that	patient	's	size	For	the	second	phase	of	the	trials	we	just	had	different	sizes	,	small	,	medium	,	large	and	 extra 	 - 	 large 	 	.
It	's	true	.
And	I	'm	sure	everyone	here	wanted	an	 extra 	 - 	 large 	 	.	Right	?
So	,	 bladder 	 s 	 	are	 definite 	 ly 	 	a	little	bit	more	complex	than	the	other	structures	.
But	there	are	other	hollow	organs	that	have	added	complexity	to	it	.
This	is	actually	a	heart	valve	,	which	we	engineered	.
And	the	way	you	engineer	this	heart	valve	is	the	same	strategy	.
We	take	the	scaffold	,	we	seed	it	with	cells	,	and	you	can	now	see	here	,	the	valve	 leaflet 	 s 	 	opening	and	closing	.
We	exercise	these	prior	to	implantation	.
Same	strategy	.
And	then	the	most	complex	are	the	solid	organs	.
For	solid	organs	,	they	're	more	complex	because	you	're	 us 	 ing 	 	a	lot	more	cells	per	centimeter	.
This	is	actually	a	simple	solid	organ	like	the	ear	.
It	's	now	being	seeded	with	cartilage	.
That	's	the	 oven 	 - 	 like 	 	device	;	once	it	's	coated	it	 get 	 s 	 	placed	there	.
And	then	a	few	weeks	later	we	can	take	out	the	cartilage	scaffold	.
This	is	actually	digits	that	we	're	engineering	.
These	are	being	layered	,	one	layer	at	a	time	,	first	the	bone	,	we	fill	in	the	gaps	with	cartilage	.
We	then	start	 add 	 ing 	 	the	muscle	on	top	.
And	you	start	 layer 	 ing 	 	these	solid	structures	.
Again	,	 fair 	 ly 	 	more	complex	organs	,	but	by	far	,	the	most	complex	solid	organs	are	actually	the	 vascular 	 ized 	 	,	highly	 vascular 	 ized 	 	,	a	lot	of	blood	vessel	supply	,	organs	such	as	the	heart	,	the	liver	,	the	 kidney 	 s 	 	.
This	is	actually	an	example	--	several	strategies	to	engineer	solid	organs	.
This	is	actually	one	of	the	strategies	.	We	use	a	printer	.
And	instead	of	 us 	 ing 	 	ink	,	we	use	--	you	just	saw	an	 ink 	 jet 	 	cartridge	--	we	just	use	cells	.
This	is	actually	your	typical	desktop	printer	.
It	's	actually	printing	this	two	chamber	heart	,	one	layer	at	a	time	.
You	see	the	heart	coming	out	there	.	It	takes	about	40	minutes	to	print	,	and	about	four	to	six	hours	later	you	see	the	muscle	cells	contract	.
This	technology	was	developed	by	Tao	Ju	,	who	worked	at	our	institute	.
And	this	is	actually	still	,	of	course	,	experimental	,	not	for	use	in	patients	.
Another	strategy	that	we	have	followed	is	actually	to	use	 de 	 cellular 	 ized 	 	organs	.
We	actually	take	donor	organs	,	organs	that	are	 discard 	 ed 	 	,	and	we	then	can	use	very	mild	 deter 	 gents 	 	to	take	all	the	cell	elements	out	of	these	organs	.
So	,	for	example	on	the	left	panel	,	top	panel	,	you	see	a	liver	.
We	actually	take	the	donor	liver	,	we	use	very	mild	 deter 	 gents 	 	,	and	we	,	by	 us 	 ing 	 	these	mild	 deter 	 gents 	 	,	we	take	all	the	cells	out	of	the	liver	.
Two	weeks	later	,	we	 bas 	 ically 	 	can	lift	this	organ	up	,	it	 feel 	 s 	 	like	a	liver	,	we	can	hold	it	like	a	liver	,	it	looks	like	a	liver	,	but	it	has	no	cells	.
All	we	are	left	with	is	the	skeleton	,	if	you	will	,	of	the	liver	,	all	made	up	of	collagen	,	a	material	that	's	in	our	bodies	,	that	will	not	reject	.
We	can	use	it	from	one	patient	to	the	next	.
We	then	take	this	vascular	structure	and	we	can	prove	that	we	retain	the	blood	vessel	supply	.
You	can	see	,	actually	that	's	a	 fluoro 	 scopy 	 	.
We	're	actually	 inject 	 ing 	 	contrast	into	the	organ	.
Now	you	can	see	it	start	.	We	're	 inject 	 ing 	 	the	contrast	into	the	organ	into	this	 de 	 cellular 	 ized 	 	liver	.
And	you	can	see	the	vascular	tree	that	remains	intact	.
We	then	take	the	cells	,	the	vascular	cells	,	blood	vessel	cells	,	we	perfuse	the	vascular	tree	with	the	patient	's	own	cells	.
We	perfuse	the	outside	of	the	liver	with	the	patient	's	own	liver	cells	.
And	we	can	then	create	functional	 liver 	 s 	 	.
And	that	's	actually	what	you	're	seeing	.
This	is	still	experimental	.	But	we	are	able	to	actually	 reproduc 	 e 	 	the	functionality	of	the	liver	structure	,	 experimental 	 ly 	 	.
For	the	kidney	,	as	I	talked	to	you	about	the	first	painting	that	you	saw	,	the	first	slide	I	 show 	 ed 	 	you	,	90	percent	of	the	patients	on	the	transplant	wait	list	are	waiting	for	a	kidney	,	90	percent	.
So	,	another	strategy	we	're	following	is	actually	to	create	 wafer 	 s 	 	that	we	stack	together	,	like	an	accordion	,	if	you	will	.
So	,	we	stack	these	 wafer 	 s 	 	together	,	 us 	 ing 	 	the	kidney	cells	.
And	then	you	can	see	these	miniature	 kidney 	 s 	 	that	we	've	engineered	.
They	are	actually	making	urine	.
Again	,	small	structures	,	our	challenge	is	how	to	make	them	larger	,	and	that	is	something	we	're	working	on	right	now	at	the	institute	.
One	of	the	things	that	I	wanted	to	 summar 	 ize 	 	for	you	then	is	what	is	a	strategy	that	we	're	going	for	in	regenerative	medicine	.
If	at	all	possible	,	we	 re 	 ally 	 	would	like	to	use	smart	 bio 	 materials 	 	that	we	can	just	take	off	the	shelf	and	 re 	 generate 	 	your	organs	.
We	are	limited	with	 distance 	 s 	 	right	now	,	but	our	goal	is	actually	to	increase	those	 distance 	 s 	 	over	time	.
If	we	can	not	use	smart	 bio 	 materials 	 	,	then	we	'd	rather	use	your	very	own	cells	.
Why	?	Because	they	will	not	reject	.
We	can	take	cells	from	you	,	create	the	structure	,	put	it	right	back	into	you	,	they	will	not	reject	.
And	if	possible	,	we	'd	rather	use	the	cells	from	your	very	specific	organ	.
If	you	present	with	a	 disease 	 d 	 	wind	pipe	we	'd	like	to	take	cells	from	your	 wind 	 pipe 	 	.
If	you	present	with	a	 disease 	 d 	 	 pancrea 	 s 	 	we	'd	like	to	take	cells	from	that	organ	.
Why	?	Because	we	'd	rather	take	those	cells	which	already	know	that	those	are	the	cell	types	you	want	.
A	 wind 	 pipe 	 	cell	already	knows	it	's	a	 wind 	 pipe 	 	cell	.
We	do	n't	need	to	teach	it	to	become	another	cell	type	.
So	,	we	prefer	 organ 	 - 	 specific 	 	cells	.
And	today	we	can	obtain	cells	from	most	every	organ	in	your	body	,	except	for	several	which	we	still	need	stem	cells	for	,	like	heart	,	liver	,	nerve	and	 pancrea 	 s 	 	.
And	for	those	we	still	need	stem	cells	.
If	we	can	not	use	stem	cells	from	your	body	then	we	'd	like	to	use	donor	stem	cells	.
And	we	prefer	cells	that	will	not	reject	and	will	not	form	tumors	.
And	we	're	working	a	lot	with	the	stem	cells	that	we	published	on	two	years	ago	,	stem	cells	from	the	amniotic	fluid	,	and	the	 placent 	 a 	 	,	which	have	those	properties	.
So	,	at	this	point	,	I	do	want	to	tell	you	that	some	of	the	major	challenges	we	have	.
You	know	,	I	just	 show 	 ed 	 	you	this	presentation	,	everything	looks	so	good	,	everything	works	.	Actually	no	,	these	technologies	 re 	 ally 	 	are	not	that	easy	.
Some	of	the	work	you	saw	today	was	performed	by	over	700	 research 	 ers 	 	at	our	institute	across	a	20-year	time	span	.
So	,	these	are	very	tough	technologies	.
Once	you	get	the	formula	right	you	can	 replicat 	 e 	 	it	.
But	it	takes	a	lot	to	get	there	.
So	,	I	always	like	to	show	this	cartoon	.
This	is	how	to	stop	a	runaway	stage	.
And	there	you	see	the	 stage 	 coach 	 	driver	,	and	he	goes	,	on	the	top	panel	,	He	goes	A	,	B	,	C	,	D	,	E	,	F	.
He	finally	stops	the	runaway	stage	.
And	those	are	usually	the	basic	scientists	,	The	bottom	is	usually	the	 surgeon 	 s 	 	.
I	'm	a	surgeon	so	that	's	not	that	funny	.
But	actually	method	A	is	the	correct	approach	.
And	what	I	mean	by	that	is	that	 any 	 time 	 	we	've	launched	one	of	these	technologies	to	the	clinic	,	we	've	made	 absolute 	 ly 	 	sure	that	we	do	everything	we	can	in	the	laboratory	before	we	ever	launch	these	technologies	to	patients	.
And	when	we	launch	these	technologies	to	patients	we	want	to	make	sure	that	we	ask	 our 	 selves 	 	a	very	tough	question	.
Are	you	ready	to	place	this	in	your	own	loved	one	,	your	own	child	,	your	own	family	member	,	and	then	we	proceed	.
Because	our	main	goal	,	of	course	,	is	first	,	to	do	no	harm	.
I	'm	going	to	show	you	now	,	a	very	short	clip	,	It	's	a	five	second	clip	of	a	patient	who	received	one	of	the	engineered	organs	.
We	started	 implant 	 ing 	 	some	of	these	structures	over	14	years	ago	.
So	,	we	have	patients	now	walking	around	with	organs	,	engineered	organs	,	for	over	10	years	,	as	well	.
I	'm	going	to	show	a	clip	of	one	young	lady	.
She	had	a	spina	 bifid 	 a 	 	defect	,	a	spinal	cord	 abnormal 	 ity 	 	.
She	did	not	have	a	normal	bladder	.	This	is	a	segment	from	CNN	.
We	are	just	taking	five	seconds	.
This	is	a	segment	that	Sanjay	Gupta	actually	took	care	of	.
Video	:	Kaitlyn	M	:	I	'm	happy	.	I	was	always	afraid	that	I	was	going	to	have	like	,	an	accident	or	something	.
And	now	I	can	just	go	and	go	out	with	my	friends	,	go	do	whatever	I	want	.
Anthony	Atala	:	See	,	at	the	end	of	the	day	,	the	promise	of	regenerative	medicine	is	a	single	promise	.
And	that	is	 re 	 ally 	 	very	simple	,	to	make	our	patients	better	.
Thank	you	for	your	attention	.

Cameron	Herold	:	Let	's	raise	kids	to	be	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 
I	would	be	willing	to	bet	that	I	'm	the	 dumb 	 est 	 	guy	in	the	room	because	I	could	n't	get	through	school	.	I	 struggle 	 d 	 	with	school	.
It	's	not	something	that	is	a	bad	thing	and	is	 vil 	 ified 	 	,	which	is	what	 happen 	 s 	 	in	a	lot	of	society	.
Kids	,	when	we	grow	up	,	have	dreams	,	and	we	have	 passion 	 s 	 	,	and	we	have	visions	,	and	 some 	 how 	 	we	get	those	things	 crush 	 ed 	 	.
We	get	told	that	we	need	to	study	 hard 	 er 	 	or	be	more	focused	or	get	a	tutor	.
My	parents	got	me	a	tutor	in	French	,	and	I	still	suck	in	French	.
Two	years	ago	,	I	was	the	 highest 	 - 	 rated 	 	lecturer	at	MIT	's	 entrepreneur 	 ial 	 	master	's	program	.
And	it	was	a	speaking	event	in	front	of	groups	of	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	from	around	the	world	.
When	I	was	in	grade	two	,	I	won	a	 city 	 - 	 wide 	 	speaking	competition	,	but	nobody	had	ever	said	,	``	Hey	,	this	kid	's	a	good	speaker	.
He	ca	n't	focus	,	but	he	loves	walking	around	and	getting	people	energized	.	''
No	one	said	,	``	Get	him	a	coach	in	speaking	.	''
They	said	,	get	me	a	tutor	in	what	I	suck	at	.
So	as	kids	show	these	traits	--	and	we	need	to	start	looking	for	them	--	I	think	we	should	be	raising	kids	to	be	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	instead	of	lawyers	.
Unfortunately	the	school	system	is	 groom 	 ing 	 	this	world	to	say	,	``	Hey	,	let	's	be	a	lawyer	or	let	's	be	a	doctor	,	''	and	we	're	missing	that	opportunity	because	no	one	ever	says	,	``	Hey	,	be	an	entrepreneur	.	''
 Entrepreneur 	 s 	 	are	people	--	because	we	have	a	lot	of	them	in	this	room	--	who	have	these	ideas	and	these	 passion 	 s 	 	or	see	these	needs	in	the	world	and	we	decide	to	stand	up	and	do	it	.
And	we	put	everything	on	the	line	to	make	that	stuff	happen	.
We	have	the	ability	to	get	those	groups	of	people	around	us	that	want	to	kind	of	build	that	dream	with	us	,	and	I	think	if	we	could	get	kids	to	embrace	the	idea	at	a	young	age	of	being	 entrepreneur 	 ial 	 	,	we	could	change	everything	in	the	world	that	is	a	problem	today	.
Every	problem	that	's	out	there	,	 some 	 body 	 	has	the	idea	for	.
And	as	a	young	kid	,	nobody	can	say	it	ca	n't	happen	because	you	're	too	dumb	to	 realiz 	 e 	 	that	you	could	n't	figure	it	out	.
I	think	we	have	an	obligation	as	parents	and	a	society	to	start	teaching	our	kids	to	fish	instead	of	giving	them	the	fish	--	the	old	parable	:	``	If	you	give	a	man	a	fish	,	you	feed	him	for	a	day	.
If	you	teach	a	man	to	fish	,	you	feed	him	for	a	lifetime	.	''
If	we	can	teach	our	kids	to	become	 entrepreneur 	 ial 	 	--	the	ones	that	show	those	traits	to	be	--	like	we	teach	the	ones	who	have	science	gifts	to	go	on	in	science	,	what	if	we	saw	the	ones	who	had	 entrepreneur 	 ial 	 	traits	and	taught	them	to	be	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	?
We	could	actually	have	all	these	kids	spreading	businesses	instead	of	waiting	for	government	 hand 	 outs 	 	.
What	we	do	is	we	sit	and	teach	our	kids	all	the	things	they	should	n't	do	:	Do	n't	hit	;	do	n't	bite	;	do	n't	swear	.
Right	now	we	teach	our	kids	to	go	after	 re 	 ally 	 	good	jobs	,	you	know	,	and	the	school	system	 teach 	 es 	 	them	to	go	after	things	like	being	a	doctor	and	being	a	lawyer	and	being	an	 account 	 ant 	 	and	a	dentist	and	a	teacher	and	a	pilot	.
And	the	media	says	that	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	if	we	could	go	out	and	be	a	model	or	a	singer	or	a	sports	hero	like	 Luong 	 o 	 	,	Crosby	.
Our	MBA	programs	do	not	teach	kids	to	be	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	.
The	reason	that	I	 avoid 	 ed 	 	an	MBA	program	--	other	than	the	fact	that	I	could	n't	get	into	any	because	I	had	a	61	percent	average	out	of	high	school	and	then	61	percent	average	at	the	only	school	in	Canada	that	accepted	me	,	Carlton	--	but	our	MBA	programs	do	n't	teach	kids	to	be	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	.
They	teach	them	to	go	work	in	 corporation 	 s 	 	.
So	who	's	starting	these	companies	?	It	's	these	random	few	people	.
Even	in	popular	literature	,	the	only	book	I	've	ever	found	--	and	this	should	be	on	all	of	your	reading	lists	--	the	only	book	I	've	ever	found	that	makes	the	entrepreneur	into	the	hero	is	``	Atlas	 Sh 	 rugged 	 	.	''
Everything	else	in	the	world	 tend 	 s 	 	to	look	at	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	and	say	that	we	're	bad	people	.
I	look	at	even	my	family	.
Both	my	 grandfather 	 s 	 	were	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	.	My	dad	was	an	entrepreneur	.
Both	my	brother	and	sister	and	I	,	all	three	of	us	own	companies	as	well	.
And	we	all	decided	to	start	these	things	because	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	the	only	place	we	fit	.
We	did	n't	fit	in	the	normal	work	.	We	could	n't	work	for	 some 	 body 	 	else	because	we	're	too	stubborn	and	we	have	all	these	other	traits	.
But	kids	could	be	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	as	well	.
I	'm	a	big	part	of	a	couple	organizations	 global 	 ly 	 	called	the	 Entrepreneur 	 s 	 	'	Organization	and	the	Young	Presidents	'	Organization	.
I	just	came	back	from	speaking	in	Barcelona	at	the	YPO	global	conference	,	and	everyone	that	I	met	over	there	who	's	an	entrepreneur	 struggle 	 d 	 	with	school	.
I	have	18	out	of	the	19	signs	of	attention	deficit	disorder	diagnosed	.
So	this	thing	right	here	is	 freak 	 ing 	 	me	out	.
It	's	probably	why	I	'm	a	little	bit	 pani 	 cked 	 	right	now	--	other	than	all	the	 caffe 	 ine 	 	that	I	've	had	and	the	sugar	--	but	this	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 creep 	 y 	 	for	an	entrepreneur	.
Attention	deficit	disorder	,	bipolar	disorder	.
Do	you	know	that	bipolar	disorder	is	 nickname 	 d 	 	the	CEO	disease	?
Ted	Turner	's	got	it	.	Steve	Jobs	has	it	.
All	three	of	the	founders	of	Netscape	had	it	.
I	could	go	on	and	on	.
Kids	--	you	can	see	these	signs	in	kids	.
And	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	is	we	're	giving	them	Ritalin	and	saying	,	``	Do	n't	be	an	 entrepreneur 	 ial 	 	type	.
Fit	into	this	other	system	and	try	to	become	a	student	.	''
Sorry	,	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	are	n't	students	.
We	 fast 	 - 	 track 	 	.	We	figure	out	the	game	.
I	stole	essays	.	I	 che 	 ated 	 	on	exams	.
I	hired	kids	to	do	my	 account 	 ing 	 	assignments	in	university	for	13	consecutive	assignments	.
But	as	an	entrepreneur	you	do	n't	do	 account 	 ing 	 	,	you	hire	 account 	 ants 	 	.
So	I	just	figured	that	out	earlier	.
At	least	I	can	admit	I	 che 	 ated 	 	in	university	;	most	of	you	wo	n't	.
I	'm	also	quoted	--	and	I	told	the	person	who	wrote	the	textbook	--	I	'm	now	quoted	in	that	exact	same	university	textbook	in	every	Canadian	university	and	college	studies	.
In	managerial	 account 	 ing 	 	,	I	'm	chapter	eight	.
I	open	up	chapter	eight	talking	about	 budget 	 ing 	 	.
And	I	told	the	author	,	after	they	did	my	interview	,	that	I	 che 	 ated 	 	in	that	same	course	.
And	she	thought	it	was	too	funny	to	not	include	it	 any 	 way 	 	.
But	kids	,	you	can	see	these	signs	in	them	.
The	definition	of	an	entrepreneur	is	``	a	person	who	 organize 	 s 	 	,	 operate 	 s 	 	and	 assume 	 s 	 	the	risk	of	a	business	venture	.	''
That	does	n't	mean	you	have	to	go	to	an	MBA	program	.
It	does	n't	mean	you	have	to	get	through	school	.
It	just	means	that	those	few	things	have	to	feel	right	in	your	gut	.
And	we	've	heard	those	things	about	``	is	it	 nurtur 	 e 	 	or	is	it	nature	,	''	right	?
Is	it	thing	one	or	thing	two	?	What	is	it	?
Well	,	I	do	n't	think	it	's	either	.	I	think	it	can	be	both	.
I	was	 groom 	 ed 	 	as	an	entrepreneur	.
When	I	was	growing	up	as	a	young	kid	,	I	had	no	choice	,	because	I	was	taught	at	a	very	early	,	young	age	--	when	my	dad	 re 	 alized 	 	I	was	n't	going	to	fit	into	everything	else	that	was	being	taught	to	me	in	school	--	that	he	could	teach	me	to	figure	out	business	at	an	early	age	.
He	 groom 	 ed 	 	us	,	the	three	of	us	,	to	hate	the	thought	of	having	a	job	and	to	love	the	fact	of	creating	companies	that	we	could	employ	other	people	.
My	first	little	business	venture	:	I	was	seven	years	old	,	I	was	in	Winnipeg	,	and	I	was	 ly 	 ing 	 	in	my	bedroom	with	one	of	those	long	extension	cords	.
And	I	was	calling	all	the	dry	cleaners	in	Winnipeg	to	find	out	how	much	would	the	dry	cleaners	pay	me	for	coat	hangers	.
And	my	mom	came	into	the	room	and	she	said	,	``	Where	are	you	going	to	get	the	coat	hangers	to	sell	to	the	dry	cleaners	?	''
And	I	said	,	``	Let	's	go	and	look	in	the	basement	.	''
And	we	went	down	to	the	basement	.	And	I	opened	up	this	 cup 	 board 	 	.
And	there	was	about	a	thousand	coat	hangers	that	I	'd	collected	.
Because	,	when	I	told	her	I	was	going	out	to	play	with	the	kids	,	I	was	going	door	to	door	in	the	neighborhood	to	collect	coat	hangers	to	put	in	the	basement	to	sell	.
Because	I	saw	her	a	few	weeks	before	that	--	you	could	get	paid	.	They	used	to	pay	you	two	cents	per	coat	hanger	.
So	I	was	just	like	,	well	there	's	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	coat	hangers	.
And	so	I	'll	just	go	get	them	.
And	I	knew	she	would	n't	want	me	to	go	get	them	,	so	I	just	did	it	 any 	 way 	 	.
And	I	learned	that	you	could	actually	 negotiat 	 e 	 	with	people	.
This	one	person	offered	me	three	cents	and	I	got	him	up	to	three	and	a	half	.
I	even	knew	at	a	 seven 	 - 	 year 	 - 	 old 	 	age	that	I	could	actually	get	a	fractional	percent	of	a	cent	,	and	people	would	pay	that	because	it	 multipli 	 ed 	 	up	.
At	seven	years	old	I	figured	it	out	.	I	got	three	and	a	half	cents	for	a	thousand	coat	hangers	.
I	sold	license	plate	 protector 	 s 	 	door	to	door	.
My	dad	actually	made	me	go	find	someone	who	would	sell	me	these	things	at	wholesale	.
And	at	nine	years	old	,	I	walked	around	in	the	city	of	Sudbury	selling	license	plate	 protector 	 s 	 	door	to	door	to	houses	.
And	I	remember	this	one	customer	so	 vivid 	 ly 	 	because	I	also	did	some	other	stuff	with	these	clients	.
I	sold	 newspaper 	 s 	 	.
And	he	would	n't	buy	a	newspaper	from	me	ever	.
But	I	was	 convinc 	 ed 	 	I	was	going	to	get	him	to	buy	a	license	plate	protector	.
And	he	's	like	,	``	Well	,	we	do	n't	need	one	.	''
And	I	said	,	``	But	you	've	got	two	cars	...	''	--	I	'm	nine	years	old	.
I	'm	like	,	``	But	you	have	two	cars	and	they	do	n't	have	license	plate	 protector 	 s 	 	.	''
And	he	said	,	``	I	know	.	''
And	I	said	,	``	This	car	here	's	got	one	license	plate	that	's	all	 c 	 rumpled 	 	up	.	''
And	he	said	,	``	Yes	,	that	's	my	wife	's	car	.	''	And	I	said	,	``	Why	do	n't	we	just	test	one	on	the	front	of	your	wife	's	car	and	see	if	it	 last 	 s 	 	 long 	 er 	 	.	''
So	I	knew	there	were	two	cars	with	two	license	plates	on	each	.
If	I	could	n't	sell	all	four	,	I	could	at	least	get	one	.
I	learned	that	at	a	young	age	.
I	did	comic	book	arbitrage	.
When	I	was	about	10	years	old	,	I	sold	comic	books	out	of	our	cottage	on	Georgian	Bay	.
And	I	would	go	biking	up	to	the	end	of	the	beach	and	buy	all	the	comics	from	the	poor	kids	.
And	then	I	would	go	back	to	the	other	end	of	the	beach	and	sell	them	to	the	rich	kids	.
But	it	was	obvious	to	me	,	right	?	Buy	low	,	sell	high	.
You	've	got	this	demand	over	here	that	has	money	.
Do	n't	try	to	sell	to	the	poor	kids	;	they	do	n't	have	cash	.	The	rich	people	do	.	Go	get	some	.
So	that	's	obvious	,	right	.
It	's	like	a	recession	.	So	,	there	's	a	recession	.
There	's	still	13	trillion	dollars	circulating	in	the	U.S.	economy	.
Go	get	some	of	that	.	And	I	learned	that	at	a	young	age	.
I	also	learned	,	do	n't	reveal	your	source	,	because	I	got	beat	up	after	about	four	weeks	of	 do 	 ing 	 	this	because	one	of	the	rich	kids	found	out	where	I	was	buying	my	comics	from	,	and	he	did	n't	like	the	fact	that	he	was	paying	a	lot	more	.
I	was	forced	to	get	a	paper	route	at	10	years	old	.
I	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	want	a	paper	route	,	but	at	10	,	my	dad	said	,	``	That	's	going	to	be	your	next	business	.	''
So	not	only	would	he	get	me	one	,	but	I	had	to	get	two	,	and	then	he	wanted	me	to	hire	someone	to	deliver	half	the	papers	,	which	I	did	,	and	then	I	 re 	 alized 	 	that	 collect 	 ing 	 	tips	was	where	you	made	all	the	money	.
So	I	would	collect	the	tips	and	get	payment	.
So	I	would	go	and	collect	for	all	the	papers	.
He	could	just	deliver	them	.
Because	then	I	 re 	 alized 	 	I	could	make	the	money	.
By	this	point	,	I	was	 definite 	 ly 	 	not	going	to	be	an	employee	.
My	dad	owned	an	automotive	and	industrial	repair	shop	.
He	had	all	these	old	automotive	parts	 ly 	 ing 	 	around	.
They	had	this	old	brass	and	copper	.
I	asked	him	what	he	did	with	it	,	and	he	said	he	just	throws	it	out	.
I	said	,	``	But	would	n't	 some 	 body 	 	pay	you	for	that	?	''	And	he	goes	,	``	Maybe	.	''
Remember	at	10	years	old	--	so	34	years	ago	I	saw	opportunity	in	this	stuff	.
I	saw	there	was	money	in	garbage	.
And	I	was	actually	 collect 	 ing 	 	it	from	all	the	automotive	shops	in	the	area	on	my	bicycle	.
And	then	my	dad	would	drive	me	on	 Saturday 	 s 	 	to	a	scrap	metal	 recycle 	 r 	 	where	I	got	paid	.
And	I	thought	that	was	kind	of	cool	.
 Strange 	 ly 	 	enough	,	30	years	later	,	we	're	building	1-800-GOT-JUNK	?
and	making	money	off	that	too	.
I	built	these	little	 pincushion 	 s 	 	when	I	was	11	years	old	in	Cubs	,	and	we	made	these	pin	 cushion 	 s 	 	for	our	 mom 	 s 	 	for	Mother	's	Day	.
And	you	made	these	 pincushion 	 s 	 	out	of	wooden	 clothes 	 pins 	 	--	when	we	used	to	hang	clothes	on	 clothes 	 lines 	 	outside	.
And	you	'd	make	these	chairs	.
And	I	had	these	little	 pillow 	 s 	 	that	I	would	sew	up	.
And	you	could	stuff	pins	in	them	.
Because	people	used	to	sew	and	they	needed	a	pin	cushion	.
But	what	I	 re 	 alized 	 	was	that	you	had	to	have	options	.
So	I	actually	spray	painted	a	whole	bunch	of	them	brown	.
And	then	when	I	went	to	the	door	,	it	was	n't	,	``	Do	you	want	to	buy	one	?	''
It	was	,	``	Which	color	would	you	like	?	''
Like	I	'm	10	years	old	;	you	're	not	going	to	say	no	to	me	,	especially	if	you	have	two	options	--	you	have	the	brown	one	or	the	clear	one	.
So	I	learned	that	lesson	at	a	young	age	.
I	learned	that	manual	labor	 re 	 ally 	 	sucks	.
Right	,	like	cutting	 lawn 	 s 	 	is	brutal	.
But	because	I	had	to	cut	 lawn 	 s 	 	all	summer	for	all	of	our	 neighbor 	 s 	 	and	get	paid	to	do	that	,	I	 re 	 alized 	 	that	recurring	revenue	from	one	client	is	amazing	.
That	if	I	land	this	client	once	,	and	every	week	I	get	paid	by	that	person	,	that	's	way	better	than	 try 	 ing 	 	to	sell	one	 clothes 	 pin 	 	thing	to	one	person	.
Because	you	ca	n't	sell	them	more	.
So	I	love	that	recurring	revenue	model	I	started	to	learn	at	a	young	age	.
Remember	,	I	was	being	 groom 	 ed 	 	to	do	this	.	I	was	not	allowed	to	have	jobs	.
I	would	caddy	,	I	would	go	to	the	golf	course	and	caddy	for	people	.
But	I	 re 	 alized 	 	that	there	was	this	one	hill	on	our	golf	course	,	the	13th	hole	that	had	this	huge	hill	.
And	people	could	never	get	their	bags	up	it	.
So	I	would	sit	there	with	a	lawn	chair	and	just	carry	up	all	the	people	who	did	n't	have	 caddie 	 s 	 	.
I	would	carry	their	golf	bags	up	to	the	top	,	and	they	'd	pay	me	a	dollar	.
Meanwhile	,	my	friends	were	working	for	five	hours	to	haul	some	guy	's	bag	around	and	get	paid	10	bucks	.
I	'm	like	,	``	That	's	stupid	because	you	have	to	work	for	five	hours	.
That	does	n't	make	any	sense	.	''	You	just	figure	out	a	way	to	make	more	money	faster	.
Every	week	,	I	would	go	to	the	corner	store	and	buy	all	these	pops	.
Then	I	would	go	up	and	deliver	them	to	these	70-year-old	women	playing	bridge	.
And	they	'd	give	me	their	orders	for	the	following	week	.
And	then	I	'd	just	deliver	pop	and	I	'd	just	charge	twice	.
And	I	had	this	captured	market	.	You	did	n't	need	contracts	.
You	just	needed	to	have	a	supply	and	demand	and	this	audience	who	bought	into	you	.
These	women	were	n't	going	to	go	to	 any 	 body 	 	else	because	they	 like 	 d 	 	me	,	and	I	kind	of	figured	it	out	.
I	went	and	got	golf	balls	from	golf	courses	.
But	everybody	else	was	looking	in	the	bush	and	looking	in	the	 ditch 	 es 	 	for	golf	balls	.
I	'm	like	,	screw	that	.	They	're	all	in	the	pond	and	nobody	's	going	into	the	pond	.
So	I	would	go	into	the	ponds	and	crawl	around	and	pick	them	up	with	my	toes	.
You	just	pick	them	up	with	both	feet	.
You	ca	n't	do	it	on	stage	.
You	get	the	golf	balls	,	and	you	just	throw	them	in	your	bathing	suit	 trunk 	 s 	 	and	when	you	're	done	you	've	got	a	couple	hundred	of	them	.
But	the	problem	is	that	people	all	did	n't	want	all	the	golf	balls	.
So	I	just	packaged	them	.	I	'm	like	12	,	right	?
I	packaged	them	up	three	ways	.
I	had	the	 Pinnacle 	 s 	 	and	 DDH 	 s 	 	and	the	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	ones	back	then	.
Those	sold	for	two	dollars	each	.
And	then	I	had	all	the	good	ones	that	did	n't	look	crappy	.	They	were	50	cents	each	.
And	then	I	'd	sell	50	at	a	time	of	all	the	crappy	ones	.
And	they	could	use	those	for	practice	balls	.
I	sold	sunglasses	,	when	I	was	in	school	,	to	all	the	kids	in	high	school	.
This	is	what	 re 	 ally 	 	kind	of	 get 	 s 	 	everybody	 hat 	 ing 	 	you	is	because	you	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	extract	money	from	all	your	friends	all	the	time	.
But	it	paid	the	bills	.
So	I	sold	lots	and	lots	of	sunglasses	.
Then	when	the	school	shut	me	down	--	the	school	actually	called	me	into	the	office	and	told	me	I	could	n't	do	it	--	so	I	went	to	the	gas	stations	and	I	sold	lots	of	them	to	the	gas	stations	and	had	the	gas	stations	sell	them	to	their	customers	.
That	was	cool	because	then	I	had	retail	outlets	.
And	I	think	I	was	14	.
Then	I	paid	my	entire	way	through	first	year	university	at	Carlton	by	selling	wine	skins	door	to	door	.
You	know	that	you	can	hold	a	40-ounce	bottle	of	rum	and	two	bottles	of	coke	in	a	 wine 	 skin 	 	?	So	what	,	right	?
Yeah	,	but	you	know	what	?	You	stuff	that	down	your	shorts	,	when	you	go	into	a	football	game	you	can	get	booze	in	for	free	,	everybody	bought	them	.
Supply	,	demand	,	big	opportunity	.
I	also	branded	it	,	so	I	sold	them	for	five	times	the	normal	cost	.
It	had	our	university	logo	on	it	.
You	know	we	teach	our	kids	and	we	buy	them	games	,	but	why	do	n't	we	get	them	games	,	if	they	're	 entrepreneur 	 ial 	 	kids	,	that	kind	of	 nurtur 	 e 	 	the	traits	that	you	need	to	be	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	?
Why	do	n't	you	teach	them	not	to	waste	money	?
I	remember	being	told	to	walk	out	in	the	middle	of	a	street	in	Banff	,	Alberta	because	I	'd	thrown	a	penny	out	in	the	street	,	and	my	dad	said	,	``	Go	pick	it	up	.	''
He	said	,	``	I	work	too	damn	hard	for	my	money	.	I	'm	not	going	to	see	you	ever	waste	a	penny	.	''
And	I	remember	that	lesson	to	this	day	.
 Allowance 	 s 	 	teach	kids	the	wrong	 habit 	 s 	 	.
 Allowance 	 s 	 	,	by	nature	,	are	teaching	kids	to	think	about	a	job	.
An	entrepreneur	does	n't	expect	a	regular	 pay 	 check 	 	.
Allowance	is	breeding	kids	at	a	young	age	to	expect	a	regular	 pay 	 check 	 	.
That	's	wrong	,	for	me	,	if	you	want	to	raise	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	.
What	I	do	with	my	kids	now	--	I	've	got	two	,	nine	and	seven	--	is	I	teach	them	to	walk	around	the	house	and	the	yard	,	looking	for	stuff	that	needs	to	get	done	.
Come	to	me	and	tell	me	what	it	is	.
Or	I	'll	come	to	them	and	say	,	``	Here	's	what	I	need	done	.	''
And	then	you	know	what	we	do	?	We	 negotiat 	 e 	 	.
They	go	around	looking	for	what	it	is	.
But	then	we	 negotiat 	 e 	 	on	what	they	're	going	to	get	paid	.
And	then	they	do	n't	have	a	regular	check	,	but	they	have	more	opportunities	to	find	more	stuff	,	and	they	learn	the	skill	of	 negotiat 	 ing 	 	,	and	they	learn	the	skill	of	finding	opportunities	as	well	.
You	breed	that	kind	of	stuff	.	Each	of	my	kids	has	two	 pigg 	 y 	 	banks	.
Fifty	percent	of	all	the	money	that	they	earn	or	get	gifted	,	50	percent	goes	in	their	house	account	,	50	percent	goes	in	their	toy	account	.
Anything	in	their	toy	account	they	can	spend	on	whatever	they	want	.
The	50	percent	that	goes	in	their	house	account	,	every	six	months	,	goes	to	the	bank	.
They	walk	up	with	me	.	Every	year	all	the	money	in	the	bank	goes	to	their	broker	.
Both	my	 nine 	 - 	 	and	 seven 	 - 	 year 	 - 	 olds 	 	have	a	stock	broker	already	.
But	I	'm	teaching	them	to	force	that	savings	habit	.
It	drives	me	crazy	that	30-year-olds	are	saying	,	``	Maybe	I	'll	start	 contribut 	 ing 	 	to	my	RSP	now	.	''
Shit	,	you	've	missed	25	years	.
You	can	teach	those	 habit 	 s 	 	to	young	kids	when	they	do	n't	even	feel	the	pain	yet	.
Do	n't	read	them	 bed 	 time 	 	stories	every	night	.
Maybe	four	nights	out	of	the	week	read	them	 bed 	 time 	 	stories	and	three	nights	of	the	week	have	them	tell	stories	.
Why	do	n't	you	sit	down	with	kids	and	give	them	four	items	,	a	red	shirt	,	a	blue	tie	,	a	kangaroo	and	a	laptop	,	and	have	them	tell	a	story	about	those	four	things	?
My	kids	do	that	all	the	time	.
It	 teach 	 es 	 	them	to	sell	;	it	 teach 	 es 	 	them	creativity	;	it	 teach 	 es 	 	them	to	think	on	their	feet	.
Just	do	that	kind	of	stuff	and	have	fun	with	it	.
Get	kids	to	stand	up	in	front	of	groups	and	talk	,	even	if	it	's	just	stand	up	in	front	of	their	friends	and	do	plays	and	have	 speech 	 es 	 	.
Those	are	 entrepreneur 	 ial 	 	traits	that	you	want	to	be	 nurtur 	 ing 	 	.
Show	the	kids	what	bad	customers	or	bad	employees	look	like	.
Show	them	the	 grump 	 y 	 	employees	.
When	you	see	 grump 	 y 	 	customer	service	,	point	that	out	to	them	.
Say	,	``	By	the	way	,	that	guy	's	a	crappy	employee	.	''
And	say	,	``	These	ones	are	good	ones	.	''
If	you	go	into	a	restaurant	and	you	have	bad	customer	service	,	show	them	what	bad	customer	service	looks	like	.
We	have	all	these	lessons	in	front	of	us	,	but	we	do	n't	take	those	opportunities	;	we	teach	kids	to	go	get	a	tutor	.
Imagine	if	you	actually	took	all	the	kids	'	junk	that	's	in	the	house	right	now	,	all	the	toys	that	they	've	 outgrow 	 n 	 	two	years	ago	and	said	,	``	Why	do	n't	we	start	selling	some	of	this	on	Craigslist	and	 Kiji 	 ji 	 	?	''
And	they	can	actually	sell	it	and	learn	how	to	find	 s 	 cammer 	 s 	 	when	they	get	email	offers	come	in	.
They	can	come	into	your	account	or	a	sub	account	or	whatever	.
But	teach	them	how	to	fix	the	price	,	guess	the	price	,	pull	up	the	photos	.
Teach	them	how	to	do	that	kind	of	stuff	and	make	money	.
Then	the	money	they	get	,	50	percent	goes	in	their	house	account	,	50	percent	goes	in	their	toy	account	.
My	kids	love	this	stuff	.
Some	of	the	 entrepreneur 	 ial 	 	traits	that	you	've	got	to	 nurtur 	 e 	 	in	kids	:	 at 	 tainment 	 	,	 tena 	 city 	 	,	leadership	,	 introspect 	 ion 	 	,	 inter 	 dependence 	 	,	values	.
All	these	traits	you	can	find	in	young	kids	,	and	you	can	help	 nurtur 	 e 	 	them	.
Look	for	that	kind	of	stuff	.
There	's	two	traits	that	I	want	you	to	also	look	out	for	that	we	do	n't	kind	of	get	out	of	their	system	.
Do	n't	 medica 	 te 	 	kids	for	attention	deficit	disorder	 un 	 less 	 	it	is	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 freak 	 ing 	 	bad	.
The	same	with	the	whole	things	on	mania	and	stress	and	depression	,	 un 	 less 	 	it	is	so	 clinical 	 ly 	 	brutal	,	man	.
Bipolar	disorder	is	 nickname 	 d 	 	the	CEO	disease	.
When	Steve	 Jur 	 vet 	 son 	 	and	Jim	Clark	and	Jim	Barksdale	have	all	got	it	,	and	they	built	Netscape	--	imagine	if	they	were	given	Ritalin	.
We	would	n't	have	have	that	stuff	,	right	?
Al	Gore	 re 	 ally 	 	would	have	had	to	 invent 	 ed 	 	the	Internet	.
These	skills	are	the	skills	we	should	be	teaching	in	the	classroom	as	well	as	everything	else	.
I	'm	not	saying	do	n't	get	kids	to	want	to	be	lawyers	.
But	how	about	getting	 entrepreneur 	 ship 	 	to	be	ranked	right	up	there	with	the	rest	of	them	as	well	?
Because	there	's	huge	opportunities	in	that	.
I	want	to	close	with	a	quick	little	video	.
It	's	a	video	that	was	done	by	one	of	the	companies	that	I	mentor	.
These	guys	,	Grasshopper	.
It	's	about	kids	.	It	's	about	 entrepreneur 	 ship 	 	.
 Hopeful 	 ly 	 	this	 inspire 	 s 	 	you	to	take	what	you	've	heard	from	me	and	do	something	with	it	to	change	the	world	.

 Major 	 a 	 	Carter	:	3	stories	of	local	 eco 	 - 	 entrepreneur 	 ship 	 
So	today	,	I	'm	going	to	tell	you	about	some	people	who	did	n't	move	out	of	their	 neighborhood 	 s 	 	.
The	first	one	is	happening	right	here	in	Chicago	.
Brenda	 Palms 	 - 	 Farber 	 	was	hired	to	help	 ex 	 - 	 convict 	 s 	 	reenter	society	and	keep	them	from	going	back	into	prison	.
Currently	,	 tax 	 payers 	 	spend	about	60,000	dollars	per	year	 s 	 ending 	 	a	person	to	jail	.
We	know	that	 two 	 - 	 third 	 s 	 	of	them	are	going	to	go	back	.
I	find	it	 interest 	 ing 	 	that	,	for	every	one	dollar	we	spend	,	however	,	on	early	childhood	education	,	like	Head	Start	,	we	save	17	dollars	on	stuff	like	incarceration	in	the	future	.
Or	--	think	about	it	--	that	60,000	dollars	is	more	than	what	it	costs	to	send	one	person	to	Harvard	as	well	.
But	Brenda	,	not	being	phased	by	stuff	like	that	,	took	a	look	at	her	challenge	and	came	up	with	a	 not 	 - 	 so 	 - 	 obvious 	 	solution	:	create	a	business	that	produces	skin	care	products	from	honey	.
Okay	,	it	might	be	obvious	to	some	of	you	;	it	was	n't	to	me	.
It	's	the	basis	of	growing	a	form	of	social	innovation	that	has	real	potential	.
She	hired	 seeming 	 ly 	 	 un 	 employ 	 able 	 	men	and	women	to	care	for	the	bees	,	harvest	the	honey	and	make	 value 	 - 	 added 	 	products	that	they	marketed	themselves	,	and	that	were	later	sold	at	Whole	Foods	.
She	combined	employment	experience	and	training	with	life	skills	they	needed	,	like	 anger 	 - 	 management 	 	and	teamwork	,	and	also	how	to	talk	to	future	 employer 	 s 	 	about	how	their	 experience 	 s 	 	actually	 demonstrat 	 ed 	 	the	lessons	that	they	had	learned	and	their	 eager 	 ness 	 	to	learn	more	.
Less	than	four	percent	of	the	folks	that	went	through	her	program	actually	go	back	to	jail	.
So	these	young	men	and	women	learned	 job 	 - 	 readiness 	 	and	life	skills	through	bee	keeping	and	became	productive	citizens	in	the	process	.
Talk	about	a	sweet	beginning	.
Now	,	I	'm	going	to	take	you	to	Los	Angeles	,	and	lots	of	people	know	that	L.A.	has	its	issues	.
But	I	'm	going	to	talk	about	L.A.	's	water	issues	right	now	.
They	have	not	enough	water	on	most	days	and	too	much	to	handle	when	it	 rain 	 s 	 	.
Currently	,	20	percent	of	California	's	energy	consumption	is	used	to	pump	water	into	mostly	Southern	California	.
Their	spending	loads	,	loads	,	to	channel	that	 rain 	 water 	 	out	into	the	ocean	when	it	 rain 	 s 	 	and	floods	as	well	.
Now	Andy	 Lipki 	 s 	 	is	working	to	help	L.A.	cut	infrastructure	costs	associated	with	water	management	and	urban	heat	island	--	linking	trees	,	people	and	technology	to	create	a	more	livable	city	.
All	that	green	stuff	actually	 natural 	 ly 	 	 absorb 	 s 	 	storm	water	,	also	 help 	 s 	 	cool	our	cities	.
Because	,	come	to	think	about	it	,	do	you	 re 	 ally 	 	want	 air 	 - 	 conditioning 	 	,	or	is	it	a	cooler	room	that	you	want	?
How	you	get	it	should	n't	make	that	much	of	a	difference	.
So	a	few	years	ago	,	L.A.	County	decided	that	they	needed	to	spend	2.5	billion	dollars	to	repair	the	city	schools	.
And	Andy	and	his	team	discovered	that	they	were	going	to	spend	200	million	of	those	dollars	on	asphalt	to	surround	the	schools	themselves	.
And	by	 present 	 ing 	 	a	 re 	 ally 	 	strong	economic	case	,	they	 convinc 	 ed 	 	the	L.A.	government	that	 replac 	 ing 	 	that	asphalt	with	trees	and	other	 green 	 ery 	 	,	that	the	schools	themselves	would	save	the	system	more	on	energy	than	they	spend	on	 horti 	 cultural 	 	infrastructure	.
So	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	,	20	million	square	feet	of	asphalt	was	replaced	or	 avoid 	 ed 	 	,	and	electrical	consumption	for	 air 	 - 	 conditioning 	 	went	down	,	while	employment	for	people	to	maintain	those	grounds	went	up	,	 result 	 ing 	 	in	a	 net 	 - 	 savings 	 	to	the	system	,	but	also	 health 	 ier 	 	students	and	schools	system	employees	as	well	.
Now	Judy	Bonds	is	a	coal	miner	's	daughter	.
Her	family	has	eight	 generation 	 s 	 	in	a	town	called	 White 	 sville 	 	,	West	Virginia	.
And	if	 any 	 one 	 	should	be	 cling 	 ing 	 	to	the	former	glory	of	the	coal	mining	history	,	and	of	the	town	,	it	should	be	Judy	.
But	the	way	coal	is	mined	right	now	is	different	from	the	deep	mines	that	her	father	and	her	father	's	father	would	go	down	into	and	that	employed	 essential 	 ly 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	and	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	.
Now	,	two	dozen	men	can	tear	down	a	mountain	in	several	months	,	and	only	for	about	a	few	years	'	worth	of	coal	.
That	kind	of	technology	is	called	``	 mountain 	 top 	 	removal	.	''
It	can	make	a	mountain	go	from	this	to	this	in	a	few	short	months	.
Just	imagine	that	the	air	 surround 	 ing 	 	these	places	--	it	's	filled	with	the	residue	of	 explosive 	 s 	 	and	coal	.
When	we	visited	,	it	gave	some	of	the	people	we	were	with	this	strange	little	cough	after	being	only	there	for	just	a	few	hours	or	so	--	not	just	miners	,	but	everybody	.
And	Judy	saw	her	landscape	being	destroyed	and	her	water	 poison 	 ed 	 	.
And	the	coal	companies	just	move	on	after	the	mountain	was	 empti 	 ed 	 	,	leaving	even	more	 un 	 employment 	 	in	their	wake	.
But	she	also	saw	the	difference	in	potential	wind	energy	on	an	intact	mountain	,	and	one	that	was	reduced	in	elevation	by	over	2,000	feet	.
Three	years	of	dirty	energy	with	not	many	jobs	,	or	centuries	of	clean	energy	with	the	potential	for	developing	expertise	and	 improvement 	 s 	 	in	efficiency	based	on	technical	skills	,	and	developing	local	knowledge	about	how	to	get	the	most	out	of	that	region	's	wind	.
She	calculated	the	 up 	 - 	 front 	 	cost	and	the	 pay 	 back 	 	over	time	,	and	it	's	a	 net 	 - 	 plus 	 	on	so	many	levels	for	the	local	,	national	and	global	economy	.
It	's	a	 long 	 er 	 	 pay 	 back 	 	than	 mountain 	 top 	 	removal	,	but	the	wind	energy	actually	 pay 	 s 	 	back	forever	.
Now	 mountain 	 top 	 	removal	 pay 	 s 	 	very	little	money	to	the	locals	,	and	it	gives	them	a	lot	of	misery	.
The	water	is	turned	into	goo	.
Most	people	are	still	 un 	 employed 	 	,	leading	to	most	of	the	same	 kind 	 s 	 	of	social	problems	that	 un 	 employed 	 	people	in	inner	cities	also	experience	--	drug	and	alcohol	abuse	,	domestic	abuse	,	teen	pregnancy	and	poor	heath	,	as	well	.
Now	Judy	and	I	--	I	have	to	say	--	totally	related	to	each	other	.
Not	quite	an	obvious	alliance	.
I	mean	,	literally	,	her	 home 	 town 	 	is	called	 White 	 sville 	 	,	West	Virginia	.
I	mean	,	they	are	not	--	they	ai	n't	 compet 	 ing 	 	for	the	birthplace	of	hip	hop	title	or	anything	like	that	.
But	the	back	of	my	 T 	 - 	 shirt 	 	,	the	one	that	she	gave	me	,	says	,	``	Save	the	 endanger 	 ed 	 	 hill 	 billies 	 	.	''
So	 home 	 girls 	 	and	 hill 	 billies 	 	we	got	it	together	and	totally	understand	that	this	is	what	it	's	all	about	.
But	just	a	few	months	ago	,	Judy	was	diagnosed	with	 stage 	 - 	 three 	 	lung	cancer	.
Yeah	.
And	it	has	since	moved	to	her	bones	and	her	brain	.
And	I	just	find	it	so	bizarre	that	she	's	 s 	 uffering 	 	from	the	same	thing	that	she	tried	so	hard	to	protect	people	from	.
But	her	dream	of	Coal	River	Mountain	Wind	is	her	legacy	.
And	she	might	not	get	to	see	that	 mountain 	 top 	 	.
But	rather	than	writing	yet	some	kind	of	manifesto	or	something	,	she	's	leaving	behind	a	business	plan	to	make	it	happen	.
That	's	what	my	 home 	 girl 	 	is	 do 	 ing 	 	.
So	I	'm	so	proud	of	that	.
But	these	three	people	do	n't	know	each	other	,	but	they	do	have	an	awful	lot	in	common	.
They	're	all	problem	 solver 	 s 	 	,	and	they	're	just	some	of	the	many	examples	that	I	 re 	 ally 	 	am	privileged	to	see	,	meet	and	learn	from	in	the	examples	of	the	work	that	I	do	now	.
I	was	 re 	 ally 	 	lucky	to	have	them	all	featured	on	my	Corporation	for	Public	Radio	radio	show	called	 The 	 Promise 	 d 	 Land 	 .org 	 	.
Now	they	're	all	very	practical	 vision 	 aries 	 	.
They	take	a	look	at	the	 demand 	 s 	 	that	are	out	there	--	beauty	products	,	healthy	schools	,	electricity	--	and	how	the	money	's	flowing	to	meet	those	 demand 	 s 	 	.
And	when	the	 cheap 	 est 	 	solutions	involve	reducing	the	number	of	jobs	,	you	're	left	with	 un 	 employed 	 	people	,	and	those	people	are	n't	cheap	.
In	fact	,	they	make	up	some	of	what	I	call	the	most	expensive	citizens	,	and	they	include	 generational 	 ly 	 	 impoverish 	 ed 	 	,	 traumat 	 ized 	 	vets	 return 	 ing 	 	from	the	Middle	East	,	people	coming	out	of	jail	.
And	for	the	 veteran 	 s 	 	in	particular	,	the	V.A	.	said	there	's	a	 six 	 - 	 fold 	 	increase	in	mental	health	 pharmaceutical 	 s 	 	by	vets	since	2003	.
I	think	that	number	's	probably	going	to	go	up	.
They	're	not	the	largest	number	of	people	,	but	they	are	some	of	the	most	expensive	--	and	in	terms	of	the	likelihood	for	domestic	abuse	,	drug	and	alcohol	abuse	,	poor	performance	by	their	kids	in	schools	and	also	poor	health	as	a	result	of	stress	.
So	these	three	guys	all	understand	how	to	 productive 	 ly 	 	channel	dollars	through	our	local	 economie 	 s 	 	to	meet	existing	market	 demand 	 s 	 	,	reduce	the	social	problems	that	we	have	now	and	prevent	new	problems	in	the	future	.
And	there	are	plenty	of	other	examples	like	that	.
One	problem	:	waste	handling	and	 un 	 employment 	 	.
Even	when	we	think	or	talk	about	recycling	,	lots	of	 re 	 cyclable 	 	stuff	ends	up	getting	 inciner 	 ated 	 	or	in	 land 	 fills 	 	and	leaving	many	 municipaliti 	 es 	 	,	diversion	rates	--	they	leave	much	to	be	 recycle 	 d 	 	.
And	where	is	this	waste	handled	?	Usually	in	poor	communities	.
And	we	know	that	 eco 	 - 	 industrial 	 	business	,	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	business	models	--	there	's	a	model	in	Europe	called	the	 eco 	 - 	 industrial 	 	park	,	where	either	the	waste	of	one	company	is	the	raw	material	for	another	,	or	you	use	 recycle 	 d 	 	materials	to	make	goods	that	you	can	actually	use	and	sell	.
We	can	create	these	local	markets	and	incentives	for	 recycle 	 d 	 	materials	to	be	used	as	raw	materials	for	manufacturing	.
And	in	my	 home 	 town 	 	,	we	actually	tried	to	do	one	of	these	in	the	Bronx	,	but	our	mayor	decided	what	he	wanted	to	see	was	a	jail	on	that	same	spot	.
Fortunately	--	because	we	wanted	to	create	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	jobs	--	but	after	many	years	,	the	city	wanted	to	build	a	jail	.
They	've	since	abandoned	that	project	,	thank	goodness	.
Another	problem	:	 un 	 healthy 	 	food	systems	and	 un 	 employment 	 	.
 Working 	 - 	 class 	 	and	poor	urban	Americans	are	not	 benefit 	 ing 	 	 economic 	 ally 	 	from	our	current	food	system	.
It	 re 	 lies 	 	too	much	on	transportation	,	chemical	fertilization	,	big	use	of	water	and	also	 refrige 	 ration 	 	.
Mega	agricultural	operations	often	are	 responsibl 	 e 	 	for	poisoning	our	 water 	 ways 	 	and	our	land	,	and	it	produces	this	 incredibl 	 y 	 	 un 	 healthy 	 	product	that	costs	us	 billion 	 s 	 	in	healthcare	and	lost	productivity	.
And	so	we	know	``	urban	ag	''	is	a	big	buzz	topic	this	time	of	the	year	,	but	it	's	mostly	 garden 	 ing 	 	,	which	has	some	value	in	community	building	--	lots	of	it	--	but	it	's	not	in	terms	of	creating	jobs	or	for	food	production	.
The	numbers	just	are	n't	there	.
Part	of	my	work	now	is	 re 	 ally 	 	laying	the	 ground 	 work 	 	to	integrate	urban	ag	and	rural	food	systems	to	hasten	the	demise	of	the	3,000-mile	salad	by	creating	a	national	brand	of	 urban 	 - 	 grown 	 	produce	in	every	city	,	that	uses	regional	growing	power	and	 augment 	 s 	 	it	with	indoor	growing	facilities	,	owned	and	operated	by	small	growers	,	where	now	there	are	only	consumers	.
This	can	support	seasonal	farmers	around	metro	areas	who	are	losing	out	because	they	 re 	 ally 	 	ca	n't	meet	the	 year 	 - 	 round 	 	demand	for	produce	.
It	's	not	a	competition	with	rural	farm	;	it	's	actually	 reinforcement 	 s 	 	.
It	allies	in	a	 re 	 ally 	 	positive	and	 economic 	 ally 	 	viable	food	system	.
The	goal	is	to	meet	the	cities	'	institutional	 demand 	 s 	 	senior	centers	,	schools	,	 day 	 care 	 	centers	,	and	produce	a	network	of	regional	jobs	,	as	well	.
This	is	smart	infrastructure	.
And	how	we	manage	our	built	environment	 affect 	 s 	 	the	health	and	 well 	 - 	 being 	 	of	people	every	single	day	.
Our	 municipaliti 	 es 	 	,	rural	and	urban	,	play	the	operational	course	of	infrastructure	--	things	like	waste	disposal	,	energy	demand	,	as	well	as	social	costs	of	 un 	 employment 	 	,	 drop 	 - 	 out 	 	rates	,	incarceration	rates	and	the	 impact 	 s 	 	of	various	public	health	costs	.
Smart	infrastructure	can	provide	 cost 	 - 	 saving 	 	ways	for	 municipaliti 	 es 	 	to	handle	both	infrastructure	and	social	needs	.
And	we	want	to	shift	the	systems	that	open	the	doors	for	people	who	were	formerly	tax	 burden 	 s 	 	to	become	part	of	the	tax	base	.
And	imagine	a	national	business	model	that	 create 	 s 	 	local	jobs	and	smart	infrastructure	to	improve	local	economic	stability	.
So	I	'm	 hop 	 ing 	 	you	can	see	a	little	theme	here	.
These	examples	indicate	a	trend	.
I	have	n't	created	it	,	and	it	's	not	happening	by	accident	.
I	'm	 notic 	 ing 	 	that	it	's	happening	all	over	the	country	,	and	the	good	news	is	that	it	's	growing	.
And	we	all	need	to	be	 invest 	 ed 	 	in	it	.
It	is	an	essential	pillar	to	this	country	's	recovery	.
And	I	call	it	``	 home 	 town 	 	security	.	''
The	recession	has	us	 reel 	 ing 	 	and	fearful	,	and	there	's	something	in	the	air	these	days	that	is	also	very	 empower 	 ing 	 	.
It	's	a	 re 	 alization 	 	that	we	are	the	key	to	our	own	recovery	.
Now	is	the	time	for	us	to	act	in	our	own	communities	where	we	think	local	and	we	act	local	.
And	when	we	do	that	,	our	 neighbor 	 s 	 	--	be	they	 next 	 - 	 door 	 	,	or	in	the	next	state	,	or	in	the	next	country	--	will	be	just	fine	.
The	sum	of	the	local	is	the	global	.
Hometown	security	means	 re 	 building 	 	our	natural	 defense 	 s 	 	,	putting	people	to	work	,	 restor 	 ing 	 	our	natural	systems	.
Hometown	security	means	creating	wealth	here	at	home	,	instead	of	 destroy 	 ing 	 	it	overseas	.
 Tack 	 ling 	 	social	and	environmental	problems	at	the	same	time	with	the	same	solution	yields	great	cost	savings	,	wealth	generation	and	national	security	.
Many	great	and	 inspir 	 ing 	 	solutions	have	been	generated	across	America	.
The	challenge	for	us	now	is	to	identify	and	support	 count 	 less 	 	more	.
Now	,	 home 	 town 	 	security	is	about	taking	care	of	your	own	,	but	it	's	not	like	the	old	saying	,	``	charity	begins	at	home	.	''
I	 recent 	 ly 	 	read	a	book	called	``	Love	Leadership	''	by	John	Hope	Bryant	.
And	it	's	about	leading	in	a	world	that	 re 	 ally 	 	does	seem	to	be	operating	on	the	basis	of	fear	.
And	reading	that	book	made	me	 re 	 examine 	 	that	theory	because	I	need	to	explain	what	I	mean	by	that	.
See	,	my	dad	was	a	great	,	great	man	in	many	ways	.
He	grew	up	in	the	segregated	South	,	 escape 	 d 	 	 lynch 	 ing 	 	and	all	that	during	some	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	times	,	and	he	provided	a	 re 	 ally 	 	stable	home	for	me	and	my	siblings	and	a	whole	bunch	of	other	people	that	fell	on	hard	times	.
But	,	like	all	of	us	,	he	had	some	problems	.
And	his	was	gambling	,	 com 	 pulsive 	 ly 	 	.
To	him	that	phrase	,	``	Charity	begins	at	home	,	''	meant	that	my	 pay 	 day 	 	--	or	someone	else	's	--	would	just	happen	to	 coincid 	 e 	 	with	his	lucky	day	.
So	you	need	to	help	him	out	.
And	sometimes	I	would	loan	him	money	from	my	 after 	 - 	 school 	 	or	summer	jobs	,	and	he	always	had	the	great	intention	of	paying	me	back	with	interest	,	of	course	,	after	he	hit	it	big	.
And	he	did	sometimes	,	believe	it	or	not	,	at	a	 race 	 track 	 	in	Los	Angeles	--	one	reason	to	love	L.A.	--	back	in	the	1940s	.
He	made	15,000	dollars	cash	and	bought	the	house	that	I	grew	up	in	.
So	I	'm	not	that	 un 	 happy 	 	about	that	.
But	listen	,	I	did	feel	 oblig 	 ated 	 	to	him	,	and	I	grew	up	--	then	I	grew	up	.
And	I	'm	a	grown	woman	now	,	and	I	have	learned	a	few	things	along	the	way	.
often	is	just	about	giving	,	because	you	're	 s 	 upposed 	 	to	,	or	because	it	's	what	you	've	always	done	,	or	it	's	about	giving	until	it	 hurt 	 s 	 	.
I	'm	about	providing	the	means	to	build	something	that	will	grow	and	intensify	its	original	investment	and	not	just	require	greater	giving	next	year	--	I	'm	not	 try 	 ing 	 	to	feed	the	habit	.
I	spent	some	years	watching	how	good	 intention 	 s 	 	for	community	 e 	 mpowerment 	 	,	that	were	 s 	 upposed 	 	to	be	there	to	support	the	community	and	empower	it	,	actually	left	people	in	the	same	,	if	not	worse	,	position	that	they	were	in	before	.
And	over	the	past	20	years	,	we	've	spent	record	 amount 	 s 	 	of	 philanthro 	 pic 	 	dollars	on	social	problems	,	yet	educational	 outcome 	 s 	 	,	 mal 	 nutrition 	 	,	incarceration	,	obesity	,	diabetes	,	income	 dispar 	 ity 	 	,	they	've	all	gone	up	with	some	 exception 	 s 	 	--	in	particular	,	infant	mortality	among	people	in	poverty	--	but	it	's	a	great	world	that	we	're	bringing	them	into	as	well	.
And	I	know	a	little	bit	about	these	issues	,	because	,	for	many	years	,	I	spent	a	long	time	in	the	 non 	 - 	 profit 	 	industrial	complex	,	and	I	'm	a	 recover 	 ing 	 	executive	director	,	two	years	clean	.
But	during	that	time	,	I	 re 	 alized 	 	that	it	was	about	projects	and	developing	them	on	the	local	level	that	 re 	 ally 	 	was	going	to	do	the	right	thing	for	our	communities	.
But	I	 re 	 ally 	 	did	struggle	for	financial	support	.
The	greater	our	success	,	the	less	money	came	in	from	 foundation 	 s 	 	.
And	I	tell	you	,	being	on	the	TED	stage	and	winning	a	MacArthur	in	the	same	exact	year	gave	everyone	the	impression	that	I	had	 arriv 	 ed 	 	.
And	by	the	time	I	'd	moved	on	,	I	was	actually	covering	a	third	of	my	agency	's	budget	deficit	with	speaking	fees	.
And	I	think	because	early	on	,	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	my	programs	were	just	a	little	bit	 a 	 head 	 	of	their	time	.
But	since	then	,	the	park	that	was	just	a	dump	and	was	featured	at	a	 TED 	 2006 	 	Talk	became	this	little	thing	.
But	I	did	in	fact	get	married	in	it	.
Over	here	.
There	goes	my	dog	who	led	me	to	the	park	in	my	wedding	.
The	South	Bronx	Greenway	was	also	just	a	drawing	on	the	stage	back	in	2006	.
Since	then	,	we	got	about	50	million	dollars	in	stimulus	package	money	to	come	and	get	here	.
And	we	love	this	,	because	I	love	construction	now	,	because	we	're	watching	these	things	actually	happen	.
So	I	want	everyone	to	understand	the	critical	importance	of	shifting	charity	into	enterprise	.
I	started	my	firm	to	help	communities	across	the	country	 realiz 	 e 	 	their	own	potential	to	improve	everything	about	the	quality	of	life	for	their	people	.
Hometown	security	is	next	on	my	 to 	 - 	 do 	 	list	.
What	we	need	are	people	who	see	the	value	in	 invest 	 ing 	 	in	these	types	of	local	 enterprise 	 s 	 	,	who	will	partner	with	folks	like	me	to	identify	the	growth	trends	and	climate	adaptation	as	well	as	understand	the	growing	social	costs	of	business	as	usual	.
We	need	to	work	together	to	embrace	and	repair	our	land	,	repair	our	power	systems	and	repair	 our 	 selves 	 	.
It	's	time	to	stop	building	the	shopping	 mall 	 s 	 	,	the	 prison 	 s 	 	,	the	 stadium 	 s 	 	and	other	 tribute 	 s 	 	to	all	of	our	collective	failures	.
It	is	time	that	we	start	building	living	 monument 	 s 	 	to	hope	and	possibility	.
Thank	you	very	much	.

Liz	Coleman	's	call	to	 re 	 invent 	 	liberal	arts	education
College	 president 	 s 	 	are	not	the	first	people	who	come	to	mind	when	the	subject	is	the	uses	of	the	creative	imagination	.
So	I	thought	I	'd	start	by	telling	you	how	I	got	here	.
The	story	begins	in	the	late	'90s	.
I	was	invited	to	meet	with	leading	 educator 	 s 	 	from	the	newly	free	Eastern	Europe	and	Russia	.
They	were	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	how	to	rebuild	their	universities	.
Since	education	under	the	Soviet	Union	was	 essential 	 ly 	 	propaganda	serving	the	purposes	of	a	state	ideology	,	they	appreciated	that	it	would	take	wholesale	 transformation 	 s 	 	if	they	were	to	provide	an	education	worthy	of	free	men	and	women	.
Given	this	rare	opportunity	to	start	fresh	,	they	chose	liberal	arts	as	the	most	 compell 	 ing 	 	model	because	of	its	historic	commitment	to	 further 	 ing 	 	its	students	'	 broad 	 est 	 	intellectual	,	and	 deep 	 est 	 	ethical	potential	.
Having	made	that	decision	they	came	to	the	United	States	,	home	of	liberal	arts	education	,	to	talk	with	some	of	us	most	 close 	 ly 	 	identified	with	that	kind	of	education	.
They	spoke	with	a	passion	,	an	urgency	,	an	intellectual	conviction	that	,	for	me	,	was	a	voice	I	had	not	heard	in	decades	,	a	dream	long	forgotten	.
For	,	in	truth	,	we	had	moved	light	years	from	the	 passion 	 s 	 	that	animated	them	.
But	for	me	,	unlike	them	,	in	my	world	,	the	slate	was	not	clean	,	and	what	was	written	on	it	was	not	 encourag 	 ing 	 	.
In	truth	,	liberal	arts	education	no	 long 	 er 	 	exists	--	at	least	genuine	liberal	arts	education	--	in	this	country	.
We	have	 professional 	 ized 	 	liberal	arts	to	the	point	where	they	no	 long 	 er 	 	provide	the	breadth	of	application	and	the	enhanced	capacity	for	civic	engagement	that	is	their	signature	.
Over	the	past	century	the	expert	has	 dethron 	 ed 	 	the	educated	 general 	 ist 	 	to	become	the	sole	model	of	intellectual	accomplishment	.
Expertise	has	for	sure	had	its	 moment 	 s 	 	.
But	the	price	of	its	dominance	is	 e 	 normous 	 	.
Subject	matters	are	broken	up	into	 small 	 er 	 	and	 small 	 er 	 	pieces	,	with	increasing	emphasis	on	the	technical	and	the	obscure	.
We	have	even	managed	to	make	the	study	of	literature	 arcan 	 e 	 	.
You	may	think	you	know	what	is	going	on	in	that	Jane	Austen	novel	--	that	is	,	until	your	first	encounter	with	postmodern	 deconstruct 	 ionism 	 	.
The	progression	of	today	's	college	student	is	to	jettison	every	interest	except	one	.
And	within	that	one	,	to	 continu 	 ally 	 	narrow	the	focus	,	learning	more	and	more	about	less	and	less	;	this	,	 despit 	 e 	 	the	evidence	all	around	us	of	the	 interconnect 	 edness 	 	of	things	.
Lest	you	think	I	 exaggerat 	 e 	 	,	here	are	the	 beginning 	 s 	 	of	the	 A 	 - 	 B 	 - 	 C 	 s 	 	of	anthropology	.
As	one	moves	up	the	ladder	,	values	other	than	technical	competence	are	viewed	with	increasing	suspicion	.
Questions	such	as	,	``	What	kind	of	a	world	are	we	making	?
What	kind	of	a	world	should	we	be	making	?
What	kind	of	a	world	can	we	be	making	?	''
are	treated	with	more	and	more	skepticism	,	and	move	off	the	table	.
In	so	 do 	 ing 	 	,	the	 guardian 	 s 	 	of	secular	democracy	in	effect	yield	the	connection	between	education	and	values	who	,	you	can	be	sure	,	have	no	 compunctio 	 ns 	 	about	 us 	 ing 	 	education	to	further	their	values	:	the	 absolute 	 s 	 	of	a	 the 	 ocracy 	 	.
Meanwhile	,	the	values	and	voices	of	democracy	are	silent	.
Either	we	have	lost	touch	with	those	values	or	,	no	better	,	believe	they	need	not	or	can	not	be	taught	.
This	 a 	 version 	 	to	social	values	may	seem	at	odds	with	the	explosion	of	community	service	programs	.
But	 despit 	 e 	 	the	attention	paid	to	these	efforts	,	they	remain	 emphatic 	 ally 	 	 extra 	 curricular 	 	.
In	effect	,	 civic 	 - 	 mindedness 	 	is	treated	as	outside	the	realm	of	what	 purport 	 s 	 	to	be	serious	thinking	and	adult	purposes	.
Simply	put	,	when	the	impulse	is	to	change	the	world	,	the	academy	is	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	 en 	 gender 	 	a	learned	 help 	 lessness 	 	than	to	create	a	sense	of	 e 	 mpowerment 	 	.
This	brew	--	 overs 	 implification 	 	of	civic	engagement	,	 ideal 	 ization 	 	of	the	expert	,	fragmentation	of	knowledge	,	emphasis	on	technical	 master 	 y 	 	,	neutrality	as	a	condition	of	academic	integrity	--	is	toxic	when	it	comes	to	 pursu 	 ing 	 	the	vital	connections	between	education	and	the	public	good	,	between	intellectual	integrity	and	human	freedom	,	which	were	at	the	heart	--	--	of	the	challenge	posed	to	and	by	my	European	 colleague 	 s 	 	.
When	the	astronomical	distance	between	the	 realitie 	 s 	 	of	the	academy	and	the	 vision 	 ary 	 	intensity	of	this	challenge	were	more	than	enough	,	I	can	assure	you	,	to	give	one	pause	,	what	was	happening	outside	higher	education	Whether	it	was	threats	to	the	environment	,	 in 	 equities 	 	in	the	distribution	of	wealth	,	lack	of	a	sane	policy	or	a	sustainable	policy	with	respect	to	the	 continu 	 ing 	 	uses	of	energy	,	we	were	in	 desperat 	 e 	 	 strait 	 s 	 	.
And	that	was	only	the	beginning	.
The	 corrupt 	 ing 	 	of	our	political	life	had	become	a	living	nightmare	;	nothing	was	exempt	--	separation	of	powers	,	civil	 libert 	 ies 	 	,	the	rule	of	law	,	the	relationship	of	church	and	state	.
 A 	 ccompanied 	 	by	a	 squander 	 ing 	 	of	the	nation	's	material	wealth	that	 de 	 fied 	 	credulity	.
A	 harrow 	 ing 	 	 predi 	 lection 	 	for	the	uses	of	force	had	become	 common 	 place 	 	,	with	an	equal	 distas 	 te 	 	for	the	alternative	forms	of	influence	.
At	the	same	time	,	all	of	our	 fire 	 power 	 	was	 im 	 potent 	 	when	it	came	to	 halt 	 ing 	 	or	even	stemming	the	slaughter	in	Rwanda	,	Darfur	,	Myanmar	.
Our	public	education	,	once	a	model	for	the	world	,	has	become	most	 note 	 worthy 	 	for	its	failures	.
 Master 	 y 	 	of	basic	skills	and	a	bare	minimum	of	cultural	literacy	 e 	 ludes 	 	vast	numbers	of	our	students	.
Despite	having	a	research	establishment	that	is	the	envy	of	the	world	,	more	than	half	of	the	American	public	do	n't	believe	in	evolution	.
And	do	n't	press	your	luck	about	how	much	those	who	do	believe	in	it	actually	understand	it	.
 Incredi 	 bly 	 	,	this	nation	,	with	all	its	material	,	intellectual	and	spiritual	resources	,	to	reverse	the	 free 	 fall 	 	in	any	of	these	areas	.
 Equal 	 ly 	 	 start 	 ling 	 	,	from	my	point	of	view	,	is	the	fact	that	no	one	was	drawing	any	connections	between	what	is	happening	to	the	body	politic	,	and	what	is	happening	in	our	leading	educational	institutions	.
We	may	be	at	the	top	of	the	list	when	it	comes	to	 influenc 	 ing 	 	access	to	personal	wealth	.
We	are	not	even	on	the	list	when	it	comes	to	our	responsibility	for	the	health	of	this	democracy	.
We	are	playing	with	fire	.
You	can	be	sure	Jefferson	knew	what	he	was	talking	about	when	he	said	,	``	If	a	nation	 expect 	 s 	 	to	be	ignorant	and	free	in	a	state	of	civilization	,	it	 expect 	 s 	 	what	never	was	,	and	never	will	be	.	''
On	a	more	personal	note	,	this	betrayal	of	our	principles	,	our	decency	,	our	hope	,	made	it	impossible	for	me	to	avoid	the	question	,	``	What	will	I	say	,	years	from	now	,	when	people	ask	,	'Where	were	you	?	'	''	As	president	of	a	leading	liberal	arts	college	,	famous	for	its	innovative	history	,	there	were	no	 excuse 	 s 	 	.
So	the	conversation	began	at	Bennington	.
Knowing	that	if	we	were	to	regain	the	integrity	of	liberal	education	,	it	would	take	radical	 re 	 thinking 	 	of	basic	 assumption 	 s 	 	,	beginning	with	our	priorities	.
 E 	 nhancing 	 	the	public	good	becomes	a	primary	objective	.
The	accomplishment	of	civic	virtue	is	tied	to	the	uses	of	intellect	and	imagination	at	their	most	 challeng 	 ing 	 	.
Our	ways	of	 approach 	 ing 	 	agency	and	authority	turn	inside	out	to	reflect	the	reality	that	no	one	has	the	answers	to	the	challenges	facing	citizens	in	this	century	,	and	everyone	has	the	responsibility	for	 try 	 ing 	 	and	 participat 	 ing 	 	in	finding	them	.
Bennington	would	continue	to	teach	the	arts	and	sciences	as	areas	of	immersion	that	 acknowledg 	 e 	 	differences	in	personal	and	professional	 objective 	 s 	 	.
But	the	 balance 	 s 	 	 redress 	 ed 	 	,	our	shared	purposes	assume	an	equal	When	the	design	 e 	 merged 	 	it	was	 s 	 urprisingly 	 	simple	and	 s 	 traightforward 	 	.
The	idea	is	to	make	the	 political 	 - 	 social 	 	challenges	themselves	--	from	health	and	education	to	the	uses	of	force	--	the	 organiz 	 ers 	 	of	the	curriculum	.
They	would	assume	the	 command 	 ing 	 	role	of	traditional	disciplines	.
But	structures	designed	to	connect	,	rather	than	divide	 mutual 	 ly 	 	dependent	circles	,	rather	than	 iso 	 lating 	 	 triangle 	 s 	 	.
And	the	point	is	not	to	treat	these	topics	as	topics	of	study	,	but	as	 framework 	 s 	 	of	action	.
The	challenge	:	to	figure	out	what	it	will	take	to	actually	do	something	that	makes	a	significant	and	sustainable	difference	.
Contrary	to	 wide 	 ly 	 	held	 assumption 	 s 	 	,	an	emphasis	on	action	provides	a	special	urgency	to	thinking	.
The	importance	of	coming	to	grips	with	values	like	justice	,	equity	,	truth	,	becomes	 i 	 ncreasingly 	 	evident	as	students	discover	that	interest	alone	can	not	tell	them	what	they	need	to	know	when	the	issue	is	 re 	 thinking 	 	education	,	our	approach	to	health	,	or	strategies	for	achieving	an	economics	of	equity	.
The	value	of	the	past	also	comes	alive	;	it	provides	a	lot	of	company	.
You	are	not	the	first	to	try	to	figure	this	out	,	just	as	you	are	unlikely	to	be	the	last	.
Even	more	valuable	,	history	provides	a	laboratory	in	which	we	see	played	out	the	actual	,	as	well	as	the	intended	 consequence 	 s 	 	of	ideas	.
In	the	language	of	my	students	,	``	Deep	thought	matters	when	you	're	 contempla 	 ting 	 	what	to	do	about	things	that	matter	.	''
A	new	liberal	arts	that	can	support	this	 action 	 - 	 oriented 	 	curriculum	has	begun	to	emerge	.
Rhetoric	,	the	art	of	organizing	the	world	of	words	to	maximum	effect	.
Design	,	the	art	of	organizing	the	world	of	things	.
 Media 	 tion 	 	and	improvisation	also	assume	a	special	place	in	this	new	 pan 	 theon 	 	.
 Quant 	 itative 	 	reasoning	 attain 	 s 	 	its	proper	position	at	the	heart	of	what	it	takes	to	manage	change	where	measurement	is	crucial	.
As	is	a	capacity	to	 discriminat 	 e 	 	 systematic 	 ally 	 	between	what	is	at	the	core	and	what	is	at	the	 peripher 	 y 	 	.
And	when	making	connections	is	of	the	essence	,	the	power	of	technology	 emerge 	 s 	 	with	special	intensity	.
But	so	does	the	importance	of	content	.
The	more	powerful	our	reach	,	the	more	important	the	question	``	About	what	?	''
When	improvisation	,	 resource 	 fulness 	 	,	imagination	are	key	,	artists	,	at	long	last	,	take	their	place	at	the	table	,	when	strategies	of	action	are	in	the	process	of	being	designed	.
In	this	 dramatic 	 ally 	 	expanded	ideal	of	a	liberal	arts	education	where	the	continuum	of	thought	and	action	is	its	life	's	blood	,	knowledge	 hon 	 ed 	 	outside	the	academy	becomes	essential	.
Social	 activist 	 s 	 	,	business	leaders	,	lawyers	,	 politician 	 s 	 	,	professionals	will	join	the	faculty	as	active	and	 ongo 	 ing 	 	participants	in	this	wedding	of	liberal	education	to	the	advancement	of	the	public	good	.
Students	,	in	turn	,	 continuous 	 ly 	 	move	outside	the	classroom	to	engage	the	world	directly	.
And	of	course	,	this	new	wine	needs	new	bottles	if	we	are	to	capture	the	 live 	 liness 	 	and	dynamism	of	this	idea	.
The	most	important	discovery	we	made	in	our	focus	on	public	action	was	to	appreciate	that	the	hard	choices	are	not	between	good	and	evil	,	but	between	 compet 	 ing 	 	goods	.
This	discovery	is	 transform 	 ing 	 	.
It	 under 	 cuts 	 	 self 	 - 	 righteous 	 ness 	 	,	 radical 	 ly 	 	 alter 	 s 	 	the	tone	and	character	of	controversy	,	and	 enrich 	 es 	 	 dramatic 	 ally 	 	the	 possibilit 	 ies 	 	for	finding	common	ground	.
Ideology	,	 zeal 	 otry 	 	,	 un 	 substantiated 	 	opinions	simply	wo	n't	do	.
This	is	a	political	education	,	to	be	sure	.
But	it	is	a	politics	of	principle	,	not	of	 p 	 artisanship 	 	.
So	the	challenge	for	Bennington	is	to	do	it	.
On	the	cover	of	Bennington	's	2008	holiday	card	is	the	architect	's	sketch	of	a	building	opening	in	2010	that	is	to	be	a	center	for	the	advancement	of	public	action	.
The	center	will	embody	and	sustain	this	new	educational	commitment	.
Think	of	it	as	a	kind	of	secular	church	.
The	words	on	the	card	describe	what	will	happen	inside	.
We	intend	to	turn	the	intellectual	and	imaginative	power	,	passion	and	 bold 	 ness 	 	of	our	students	,	faculty	and	staff	to	developing	strategies	for	acting	on	the	critical	challenges	of	our	time	.
So	we	are	 do 	 ing 	 	our	job	.
While	these	past	weeks	have	been	a	time	of	national	 exhila 	 ration 	 	in	this	country	,	it	would	be	tragic	if	you	thought	this	meant	your	job	was	done	.
The	glacial	silence	we	have	 experience 	 d 	 	in	the	face	of	the	 shredd 	 ing 	 	of	the	constitution	,	the	 unravel 	 ing 	 	of	our	public	institutions	,	the	deterioration	of	our	infrastructure	is	not	limited	to	the	universities	.
We	the	people	have	become	 in 	 ured 	 	to	our	own	 ir 	 relevance 	 	when	it	comes	to	 do 	 ing 	 	anything	significant	about	anything	that	matters	 concern 	 ing 	 	governance	,	beyond	waiting	another	four	years	.
We	persist	also	in	being	 side 	 lined 	 	by	the	idea	of	the	expert	as	the	only	one	capable	of	coming	up	with	answers	,	 despit 	 e 	 	the	 overwhelm 	 ing 	 	evidence	to	the	 contra 	 ry 	 	.
The	problem	is	there	is	no	such	thing	as	a	viable	democracy	made	up	of	experts	,	 zeal 	 ots 	 	,	 politician 	 s 	 	and	 spectator 	 s 	 	.
People	will	continue	and	should	continue	to	learn	everything	there	is	to	know	about	something	or	other	.
We	actually	do	it	all	the	time	.
And	there	will	be	and	should	be	those	who	spend	a	lifetime	 pursu 	 ing 	 	a	very	highly	defined	area	of	inquiry	.
But	this	 single 	 - 	 mindedness 	 	will	not	yield	the	 flexi 	 bilities 	 	of	mind	,	the	 multiplicit 	 y 	 	of	 perspective 	 s 	 	,	the	capacities	for	collaboration	and	innovation	this	country	needs	.
That	is	where	you	come	in	.
What	is	certain	is	that	the	individual	talent	 exhibit 	 ed 	 	in	such	abundance	here	,	needs	to	turn	its	attention	to	that	collaborative	,	 mess 	 y 	 	,	 frustrat 	 ing 	 	,	 content 	 ious 	 	and	impossible	world	of	politics	and	public	policy	.
President	Obama	and	his	team	simply	can	not	do	it	alone	.
If	the	question	of	where	to	start	 seem 	 s 	 	 overwhelm 	 ing 	 	you	are	at	the	beginning	,	not	the	end	of	this	adventure	.
Being	 overwhelm 	 ed 	 	is	the	first	step	if	you	are	serious	about	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	at	things	that	 re 	 ally 	 	matter	,	on	a	scale	that	makes	a	difference	.
So	what	do	you	do	when	you	feel	 overwhelm 	 ed 	 	?
Well	,	you	have	two	things	.
You	have	a	mind	.	And	you	have	other	people	.
Start	with	those	,	and	change	the	world	.

Lawrence	 Less 	 ig 	 	:	 Re 	 - 	 examin 	 ing 	 	the	remix
I	want	to	talk	about	what	we	learn	from	 conservative 	 s 	 	.
And	I	'm	at	a	stage	in	life	where	I	'm	 y 	 earning 	 	for	my	old	days	,	so	I	want	to	confess	to	you	that	when	I	was	a	kid	,	 inde 	 ed 	 	,	I	was	a	conservative	.
I	was	a	Young	Republican	,	a	Teenage	Republican	,	a	leader	in	the	Teenage	Republicans	.
Indeed	,	I	was	the	 young 	 est 	 	member	of	any	delegation	in	the	1980	convention	that	elected	Ronald	Reagan	to	be	the	Republican	nominee	for	president	.
Now	,	I	know	what	you	're	thinking	.
You	're	thinking	,	``	That	's	not	what	the	 Internet 	 s 	 	say	.	''
You	're	thinking	,	``	Wikipedia	does	n't	say	this	fact	.	''
And	 inde 	 ed 	 	,	this	is	just	one	of	the	examples	of	the	junk	that	flows	across	the	tubes	in	these	 Internet 	 s 	 	here	.
Wikipedia	reports	that	this	guy	,	this	former	 congress 	 man 	 	from	Erie	,	Pennsylvania	was	,	at	the	age	of	20	,	one	of	the	 young 	 est 	 	people	at	the	Republican	National	Convention	,	but	it	's	just	not	true	.
Indeed	,	it	drives	me	so	nuts	,	let	me	just	change	this	little	fact	here	.
All	right	.	Okay	,	so	...	perfect	.
Perfect	.
Okay	,	speaker	Lawrence	 Less 	 ig 	 	,	right	.
Okay	.
Finally	,	truth	will	be	brought	here	.
Okay	,	see	?	It	's	done	.	It	's	almost	done	.	Here	we	go	.
``	...	Youngest	Republican	,	''	okay	,	we	're	finished	.
That	's	it	.	Please	save	this	.
Great	,	here	we	go	.
And	...	Wikipedia	is	fixed	,	finally	.
Okay	,	but	no	,	this	is	 re 	 ally 	 	besides	the	point	.
But	the	thing	I	want	you	to	think	about	when	we	think	about	 conservative 	 s 	 	--	not	so	much	this	issue	of	the	1980	convention	--	the	thing	to	think	about	is	this	:	They	go	to	church	.
Now	,	you	know	,	I	mean	,	a	lot	of	people	go	to	church	.
I	'm	not	talking	about	that	only	 conservative 	 s 	 	go	to	church	.
And	I	'm	not	talking	about	the	God	thing	.
I	do	n't	want	to	get	into	that	,	you	know	;	that	's	not	my	point	.
They	go	to	church	,	by	which	I	mean	,	they	do	lots	of	things	for	free	for	each	other	.
They	hold	 pot 	 luck 	 	 dinner 	 s 	 	.
Indeed	,	they	sell	books	about	 pot 	 luck 	 	 dinner 	 s 	 	.
They	serve	food	to	poor	people	.
They	share	,	they	give	,	they	give	away	for	free	.
And	it	's	the	very	same	people	leading	Wall	Street	firms	who	,	on	Sundays	,	show	up	and	share	.
And	not	only	food	,	right	.
These	very	same	people	are	strong	 believer 	 s 	 	,	in	lots	of	 context 	 s 	 	,	in	the	limits	on	the	markets	.
They	are	in	many	important	places	against	markets	.
Indeed	,	they	,	like	all	of	us	,	 celebrat 	 e 	 	this	kind	of	relationship	.
But	they	're	very	keen	that	we	do	n't	let	money	drop	into	that	relationship	,	else	it	turns	into	something	like	this	.
They	want	to	regulate	us	,	those	 conservative 	 s 	 	,	to	stop	us	from	 a 	 llowing 	 	the	market	to	spread	in	those	places	.
Because	they	understand	:	There	are	places	for	the	market	and	places	where	the	market	should	not	exist	,	where	we	should	be	free	to	enjoy	the	fellowship	of	others	.
They	 recogniz 	 e 	 	:	Both	of	these	things	have	to	live	together	.
And	the	second	great	thing	about	 conservative 	 s 	 	:	they	get	ecology	.
Right	,	it	was	the	first	great	Republican	president	of	the	20th	century	who	taught	us	about	environmental	thinking	--	Teddy	Roosevelt	.
They	first	taught	us	about	ecology	in	the	context	of	natural	resources	.
And	then	they	began	to	teach	us	in	the	context	of	They	understand	,	in	that	context	,	``	free	.	''	They	understand	``	free	''	is	an	important	essential	part	of	the	cultural	ecology	as	well	.
That	's	the	thing	I	want	you	to	think	about	them	.
Now	,	I	know	you	do	n't	believe	me	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	here	.
So	here	's	exhibit	number	one	.
I	want	to	share	with	you	my	latest	hero	,	Julian	Sanchez	,	a	libertarian	who	works	at	the	,	for	many	people	,	``	evil	''	Cato	Institute	.
Okay	,	so	Julian	made	this	video	.
He	's	a	terrible	producer	of	videos	,	but	it	's	great	content	,	so	I	'm	going	to	give	you	a	little	bit	of	it	.
So	here	he	is	beginning	.
Julian	Sanchez	:	I	'm	going	to	make	an	observation	about	the	way	remix	culture	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	evolving	...
Larry	 Less 	 ig 	 	:	So	what	he	does	is	he	begins	to	tell	us	about	these	three	videos	.
This	is	this	fantastic	Brat	Pack	remix	set	to	 Liszt 	 omania 	 	.
Which	,	of	course	,	spread	 vir 	 ally 	 	.
 Hugel 	 y 	 	successful	.
And	then	some	people	from	Brooklyn	saw	it	.
They	decided	they	wanted	to	do	the	same	.
And	then	,	of	course	,	people	from	San	 Fransis 	 co 	 	saw	it	.
And	San	 Franciscan 	 s 	 	thought	they	had	to	do	the	same	as	well	.
And	so	they	're	beautiful	,	but	this	libertarian	has	some	important	lessons	he	 want 	 s 	 	us	to	learn	from	this	.
Here	's	lesson	number	one	.
JS	:	There	's	 obvious 	 ly 	 	also	something	 re 	 ally 	 	 deep 	 ly 	 	great	about	this	.
They	are	acting	in	the	sense	that	they	're	 em 	 ulating 	 	the	original	 mash 	 up 	 	.
And	the	guy	who	shot	it	 obvious 	 ly 	 	has	a	strong	eye	and	some	experience	with	video	editing	.
But	this	is	also	 bas 	 ically 	 	just	a	group	of	friends	having	an	authentic	social	moment	and	 screw 	 ing 	 	around	together	.
It	should	feel	familiar	and	kind	of	 resonat 	 e 	 	for	 any 	 one 	 	who	's	had	a	 s 	 ing 	 - 	 a 	 - 	 long 	 	or	a	dance	party	with	a	group	of	good	friends	.
LL	:	Or	...
JS	:	So	that	's	 important 	 ly 	 	different	from	the	earlier	videos	we	looked	at	because	here	,	remix	is	n't	just	about	an	individual	 do 	 ing 	 	something	alone	in	his	basement	;	it	becomes	an	act	of	social	creativity	.
And	it	's	not	just	that	it	yields	a	different	kind	of	product	at	the	end	,	it	's	that	 potential 	 ly 	 	it	changes	the	way	that	we	relate	to	each	other	.
All	of	our	normal	social	interactions	become	a	kind	of	invitation	to	this	sort	of	collective	expression	.
It	's	our	real	social	lives	themselves	that	are	 trans 	 muted 	 	into	art	.
LL	:	And	so	then	,	what	this	libertarian	draws	from	these	two	points	...
JS	:	One	remix	is	about	 individual 	 s 	 	 us 	 ing 	 	our	shared	culture	as	a	kind	of	language	to	communicate	something	to	an	audience	.
Stage	two	,	social	remix	,	is	 re 	 ally 	 	about	 us 	 ing 	 	it	to	mediate	people	's	relationships	to	each	other	.
First	,	within	each	video	,	the	Brat	Pack	characters	are	used	as	a	kind	of	template	for	performing	the	social	reality	of	each	group	.
But	there	's	also	a	dialogue	between	the	videos	,	where	,	once	the	basic	structure	is	established	,	it	becomes	a	kind	of	platform	for	 articulat 	 ing 	 	the	similarities	and	differences	between	the	groups	'	social	and	physical	worlds	.
LL	:	And	then	,	here	's	for	me	,	the	critical	key	to	what	Julian	has	to	say	...
JS	:	Copyright	policy	is	n't	just	about	how	to	incentivize	the	production	of	a	certain	kind	of	artistic	commodity	;	it	's	about	what	level	of	control	we	're	going	to	permit	to	be	 exercise 	 d 	 	over	our	social	 realitie 	 s 	 	--	social	 realitie 	 s 	 	that	are	now	 inevit 	 ably 	 	 permeat 	 ed 	 	by	pop	culture	.
I	think	it	's	important	that	we	keep	these	two	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	public	goods	in	mind	.
If	we	're	only	focused	on	how	to	 maximiz 	 e 	 	the	supply	of	one	,	I	think	we	risk	 suppress 	 ing 	 	this	different	and	richer	and	,	in	some	ways	,	maybe	even	more	important	one	.
LL	:	Right	.	Bingo	.	Point	.
Freedom	needs	this	opportunity	to	both	have	the	commercial	success	of	the	great	commercial	works	and	the	opportunity	to	build	this	different	kind	of	culture	.
And	for	that	to	happen	,	you	need	ideas	like	fair	use	to	be	central	and	protected	,	to	 en 	 able 	 	this	kind	of	innovation	,	as	this	libertarian	 tell 	 s 	 	us	,	between	these	two	creative	cultures	,	a	commercial	and	a	sharing	culture	.
The	point	is	they	,	he	,	here	,	 get 	 s 	 	that	culture	.
Now	,	my	concern	is	,	we	Dems	,	too	often	,	not	so	much	.
All	right	,	take	for	example	this	great	company	.
In	the	good	old	days	when	this	Republican	ran	that	company	,	their	greatest	work	was	work	that	built	on	the	past	,	right	.
All	of	the	great	Disney	works	were	works	that	took	works	that	were	in	the	public	domain	and	 re 	 mixed 	 	them	,	or	waited	until	they	entered	the	public	domain	to	remix	them	,	to	 celebrat 	 e 	 	this	 add 	 - 	 on 	 	remix	creativity	.
Indeed	,	Mickey	Mouse	himself	,	of	course	,	as	``	Steamboat	Willie	,	''	is	a	remix	of	the	then	,	very	dominant	,	very	popular	``	Steamboat	Bill	''	by	Buster	Keaton	.
This	man	was	a	 remix 	 er 	 	 extraordinair 	 e 	 	.
He	is	the	celebration	and	ideal	of	 exact 	 ly 	 	this	kind	of	creativity	.
But	then	the	company	passes	through	this	dark	stage	to	this	Democrat	.
 Wild 	 ly 	 	different	.
This	is	the	 master 	 mind 	 	behind	the	eventual	passage	of	what	we	call	the	Sonny	Bono	Copyright	Term	Extension	Act	,	 extend 	 ing 	 	the	term	of	existing	 copyright 	 s 	 	by	20	years	,	so	that	no	one	could	do	to	Disney	what	Disney	did	to	the	Brothers	Grimm	.
Now	,	when	we	tried	to	challenge	this	,	going	to	the	Supreme	Court	,	getting	the	Supreme	Court	,	the	bunch	of	 conservative 	 s 	 	there	--	if	we	could	get	them	to	wake	up	to	this	--	to	strike	it	down	,	we	had	the	assistance	of	Nobel	Prize	winners	including	this	 right 	 - 	 wing 	 	Nobel	Prize	winner	,	Milton	Friedman	,	who	said	he	would	join	our	brief	only	if	the	word	``	no	 brain 	 er 	 	''	was	in	the	brief	 s 	 omewhere 	 	.
But	 apparent 	 ly 	 	,	no	brains	existed	in	this	place	when	Democrats	passed	and	signed	this	bill	into	law	.
Now	,	tiny	little	quibble	of	a	 foot 	 note 	 	:	Sonny	Bono	,	you	might	say	,	was	a	Republican	,	but	I	do	n't	buy	it	.
This	guy	is	no	Republican	.
Okay	,	for	a	second	example	,	think	about	this	cultural	hero	,	icon	on	the	Left	,	creator	of	this	character	.
Look	at	the	site	that	he	built	:	``	Star	Wars	''	 Mash 	 Up 	 s 	 	,	 invit 	 ing 	 	people	to	come	and	use	their	creative	energy	to	produce	a	new	generation	of	attention	towards	this	 extraordinar 	 ily 	 	important	cultural	icon	.
Read	the	license	.
The	license	for	these	 remix 	 ers 	 	 assign 	 s 	 	all	of	the	rights	to	the	remix	back	to	Lucas	.
The	 mash 	 up 	 	is	owned	by	Lucas	.
Indeed	,	anything	you	add	to	the	 mash 	 up 	 	,	music	you	might	add	,	Lucas	has	a	worldwide	perpetual	right	to	exploit	that	for	free	.
There	is	no	creator	here	to	be	recognized	.
The	creator	does	n't	have	any	rights	.
The	creator	is	a	 share 	 cropper 	 	in	this	story	.
And	we	should	remember	who	employed	the	 share 	 cropper 	 s 	 	:	the	Democrats	,	right	?
So	the	point	is	the	Republicans	here	 recogniz 	 e 	 	that	there	's	a	certain	need	of	ownership	,	a	respect	for	ownership	,	the	respect	we	should	give	the	creator	,	the	 remix 	 er 	 	,	the	owner	,	the	property	owner	,	the	copyright	owner	of	this	 extraordinar 	 ily 	 	powerful	stuff	,	and	not	a	generation	of	 share 	 cropper 	 s 	 	.
Now	,	I	think	there	are	lessons	we	should	learn	here	,	lessons	about	 open 	 ness 	 	.
Our	lives	are	sharing	activities	,	at	least	in	part	.
Even	for	the	head	of	Goldman	Sachs	,	at	least	in	part	.
And	for	that	sharing	activity	to	happen	,	we	have	to	have	 well 	 - 	 protected 	 	spaces	of	fair	use	.
That	's	number	one	.	Number	two	:	This	ecology	of	sharing	needs	freedom	within	which	to	create	.
Freedom	,	which	means	without	permission	from	 any 	 one 	 	,	the	ability	to	create	.
And	number	three	:	We	need	to	respect	the	creator	,	the	creator	of	these	remixes	through	rights	that	are	directly	tied	to	them	.
Now	,	this	 explain 	 s 	 	the	 right 	 - 	 wing 	 	 non 	 profit 	 	Creative	Commons	.
Actually	,	it	's	not	a	 right 	 - 	 wing 	 	 non 	 profit 	 	,	but	of	course	--	let	me	just	tie	it	here	--	the	Creative	Commons	,	which	is	offering	 author 	 s 	 	this	simple	way	to	mark	their	content	with	the	 freedom 	 s 	 	they	intended	to	carry	.
So	that	we	go	from	a	``	all	rights	reserved	''	world	to	a	``	some	rights	reserved	''	world	so	that	people	can	know	the	 freedom 	 s 	 	they	have	attached	to	the	content	,	building	and	creating	on	the	basis	of	this	creative	 copyright 	 ed 	 	work	.
These	tools	that	we	built	 en 	 able 	 	this	sharing	in	parts	through	 license 	 s 	 	that	make	it	clear	and	a	freedom	to	create	without	 requir 	 ing 	 	permission	first	because	the	permission	has	already	been	granted	and	a	respect	for	the	creator	because	it	 build 	 s 	 	upon	a	copyright	the	creator	has	licensed	 free 	 ly 	 	.
And	it	 explain 	 s 	 	the	vast	 right 	 - 	 wing 	 	conspiracy	that	's	 obvious 	 ly 	 	developed	around	these	 license 	 s 	 	,	as	now	more	than	350	million	digital	objects	are	out	there	,	licensed	 free 	 ly 	 	in	this	way	.
Now	that	picture	of	an	ecology	of	creativity	,	the	picture	of	an	ecology	of	balanced	creativity	,	is	that	the	ecology	of	creativity	we	have	right	now	?
Well	,	as	you	all	know	,	not	many	of	us	believe	we	do	.
I	 tripp 	 ed 	 	on	the	reality	of	this	ecology	of	creativity	just	last	week	.
I	created	a	video	which	was	based	on	a	 Wire 	 side 	 	Chat	that	I	'd	given	,	and	I	 upload 	 ed 	 	it	to	YouTube	.
I	then	got	this	email	from	YouTube	 weird 	 ly 	 	 notify 	 ing 	 	me	that	there	was	content	in	that	owned	by	the	mysterious	WMG	that	matched	their	content	ID	.
So	I	did	n't	think	much	about	it	.
And	then	on	Twitter	,	 some 	 body 	 	said	to	me	,	``	Your	talk	on	YouTube	was	 DMC 	 A 	 	'd	.	Was	that	your	purpose	?	''
 imagin 	 ing 	 	that	I	had	this	deep	conspiracy	to	reveal	the	obvious	 flaw 	 s 	 	in	the	 DMC 	 A 	 	.
I	answered	,	``	No	.	''	I	did	n't	even	think	about	it	.
But	then	I	went	to	the	site	and	all	of	the	audio	in	my	site	had	been	 silenc 	 ed 	 	.
My	whole	45-minute	video	had	been	 silenc 	 ed 	 	because	there	were	 snippet 	 s 	 	in	that	video	,	a	video	about	fair	use	,	that	included	Warner	Music	Group	music	.
Now	,	 interest 	 ingly 	 	,	they	still	sold	ads	for	that	music	,	if	you	played	the	silent	video	.
You	could	still	buy	the	music	,	but	you	could	n't	hear	anything	because	it	had	been	 silenc 	 ed 	 	.
So	I	did	what	the	current	regime	says	I	must	do	to	be	free	to	use	YouTube	to	talk	about	fair	use	.
I	went	to	this	site	,	and	I	had	to	answer	these	questions	.
And	then	in	an	 extraordinar 	 ily 	 	Bart	 Simpson 	 - 	 like 	 	,	juvenile	way	you	've	actually	got	to	type	out	these	words	and	get	them	right	to	 re 	 assert 	 	your	freedom	to	speak	.
And	I	felt	like	I	was	in	third	grade	again	.
``	I	will	not	put	tacks	on	the	teacher	's	chair	.
I	will	not	put	tacks	on	the	teacher	's	chair	.	''
This	is	absurd	.
It	is	outrageous	.
It	is	an	 extraordinar 	 y 	 	 per 	 version 	 	of	the	system	of	freedom	we	should	be	 encourag 	 ing 	 	.
And	the	question	I	ask	you	is	:	Who	's	fighting	it	?
Well	,	 interest 	 ingly 	 	,	in	the	last	presidential	election	,	who	was	the	number	one	,	active	opponent	of	this	system	of	regulation	in	online	speech	?
John	McCain	.
Letter	after	letter	 attack 	 ing 	 	YouTube	's	 refus 	 al 	 	to	be	more	respectful	of	fair	use	with	their	 extraordinar 	 y 	 	notice	and	take	down	system	,	that	led	his	campaign	so	many	times	to	be	thrown	off	the	Internet	.
Now	,	that	was	the	story	of	me	then	,	my	good	old	days	of	 right 	 - 	 wing 	 	lunacy	.
Let	me	come	back	to	now	,	now	when	I	'm	a	little	 left 	 ist 	 	--	I	'm	 certain 	 ly 	 	 left 	 - 	 handed 	 	,	so	at	least	a	 left 	 y 	 	--	And	I	wonder	,	can	we	on	the	Left	expect	to	build	this	ecology	of	freedom	,	now	,	in	a	world	where	we	know	the	 extraordinar 	 ily 	 	powerful	influences	against	it	,	where	even	icons	of	the	Left	like	this	entertain	and	push	bills	that	would	 effective 	 ly 	 	ban	the	requirement	of	open	access	for	 government 	 - 	 funded 	 	research	?
The	president	,	who	has	supported	a	process	that	 secret 	 ly 	 	 negotiat 	 es 	 	agreements	,	which	 effective 	 ly 	 	lock	us	into	the	insane	system	of	 DMC 	 A 	 	that	we	have	adopted	and	 like 	 ly 	 	lock	us	down	a	path	of	three	strikes	,	you	're	out	that	,	of	course	,	the	rest	of	the	world	are	 i 	 ncreasingly 	 	 adopt 	 ing 	 	.
Not	a	single	example	of	reform	has	been	produced	yet	.
And	we	're	not	going	to	see	this	change	in	this	system	 any 	 time 	 	soon	.
So	here	's	the	lessons	of	 open 	 ness 	 	that	I	think	we	need	to	learn	.
 Open 	 ness 	 	is	a	commitment	to	a	certain	set	of	values	.
We	need	to	speak	of	those	values	.
The	value	of	freedom	.	It	's	a	value	of	community	.
It	's	a	value	of	the	limits	in	regulation	.
It	's	a	value	 respect 	 ing 	 	the	creator	.
Now	,	if	we	can	learn	those	values	from	at	least	some	influences	on	the	Right	,	if	we	can	take	them	and	incorporate	them	,	maybe	we	could	do	a	little	trade	.
We	learn	those	values	on	the	Left	,	and	maybe	they	'll	do	health	care	or	global	warming	legislation	or	something	in	the	Right	.
Anyway	,	please	join	me	in	teaching	these	values	.
Thank	you	very	much	.

 Britt 	 a 	 	Riley	:	A	garden	in	my	apartment
I	,	like	many	of	you	,	am	one	of	the	two	billion	people	on	Earth	who	live	in	cities	.
And	there	are	days	--	I	do	n't	know	about	the	rest	of	you	guys	--	but	there	are	days	when	I	 palpa 	 bly 	 	feel	how	much	I	 re 	 ly 	 	on	other	people	for	pretty	much	everything	in	my	life	.
And	some	days	,	that	can	even	be	a	little	 s 	 cary 	 	.
But	what	I	'm	here	to	talk	to	you	about	today	is	how	that	same	 inter 	 dependence 	 	is	actually	an	 extreme 	 ly 	 	powerful	social	infrastructure	that	we	can	actually	harness	to	help	heal	some	of	our	 deep 	 est 	 	civic	issues	,	if	we	apply	open	source	collaboration	.
A	couple	of	years	ago	,	I	read	an	article	by	New	York	Times	writer	Michael	Pollan	in	which	he	argued	that	growing	even	some	of	our	own	food	is	one	of	the	best	things	that	we	can	do	for	the	environment	.
Now	at	the	time	that	I	was	reading	this	,	it	was	the	middle	of	the	winter	and	I	 definite 	 ly 	 	did	not	have	room	for	a	lot	of	dirt	in	my	New	York	City	apartment	.
So	I	was	 bas 	 ically 	 	just	willing	to	settle	for	just	reading	the	next	Wired	magazine	and	finding	out	how	the	experts	were	going	to	figure	out	how	to	solve	all	these	problems	for	us	in	the	future	.
But	that	was	actually	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	point	that	Michael	Pollan	was	making	in	this	article	--	was	it	's	 precise 	 ly 	 	when	we	hand	over	the	responsibility	for	all	these	things	to	 specialist 	 s 	 	that	we	cause	the	kind	of	 messe 	 s 	 	that	we	see	with	the	food	system	.
So	,	I	happen	to	know	a	little	bit	from	my	own	work	about	how	NASA	has	been	 us 	 ing 	 	 hydroponic 	 s 	 	to	explore	growing	food	in	space	.
And	you	can	actually	get	optimal	nutritional	yield	by	running	a	kind	of	 high 	 - 	 quality 	 	liquid	soil	over	plants	'	root	systems	.
Now	to	a	vegetable	plant	,	my	apartment	has	got	to	be	about	as	foreign	as	outer	space	.
But	I	can	offer	some	natural	light	and	 year 	 - 	 round 	 	climate	control	.
 Fast 	 - 	 forward 	 	two	years	later	:	we	now	have	window	farms	,	which	are	vertical	,	hydroponic	platforms	for	 food 	 - 	 growing 	 	 indoor 	 s 	 	.
And	the	way	it	works	is	that	there	's	a	pump	at	the	bottom	,	which	 periodical 	 ly 	 	 s 	 ends 	 	some	of	this	liquid	nutrient	solution	up	to	the	top	,	which	then	 trick 	 les 	 	down	through	plants	'	root	systems	that	are	 suspend 	 ed 	 	in	clay	 pellet 	 s 	 	--	so	there	's	no	dirt	involved	.
Now	light	and	temperature	vary	with	each	window	's	 micro 	 climate 	 	,	so	a	window	farm	 require 	 s 	 	a	farmer	,	and	she	must	decide	what	kind	of	crops	she	is	going	to	put	in	her	window	farm	,	and	whether	she	is	going	to	feed	her	food	 organic 	 ally 	 	.
Back	at	the	time	,	a	window	farm	was	no	more	than	a	 technical 	 ly 	 	complex	idea	that	was	going	to	require	a	lot	of	testing	.
And	I	 re 	 ally 	 	wanted	it	to	be	an	open	project	,	because	 hydroponic 	 s 	 	is	one	of	the	 fast 	 est 	 	growing	areas	of	 patent 	 ing 	 	in	the	United	States	right	now	and	could	possibly	become	another	area	like	Monsanto	,	where	we	have	a	lot	of	corporate	intellectual	property	in	the	way	of	people	's	food	.
So	I	decided	that	,	instead	of	creating	a	product	,	what	I	was	going	to	do	was	open	this	up	to	a	whole	bunch	of	 co 	 - 	 developer 	 s 	 	.
The	first	few	systems	that	we	created	,	they	kind	of	worked	.
We	were	actually	able	to	grow	about	a	salad	a	week	in	a	typical	New	York	City	apartment	window	.
And	we	were	able	to	grow	cherry	tomatoes	and	 cucumber 	 s 	 	,	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	stuff	.
But	the	first	few	systems	were	these	 leak 	 y 	 	,	loud	 power 	 - 	 guzzle 	 rs 	 	that	Martha	Stewart	would	 definite 	 ly 	 	never	have	approved	.
So	to	bring	on	more	 co 	 - 	 developer 	 s 	 	,	what	we	did	was	we	created	a	social	media	site	on	which	we	published	the	designs	,	we	explained	how	they	worked	,	and	we	even	went	so	far	as	to	point	out	everything	that	was	wrong	with	these	systems	.
And	then	we	invited	people	all	over	the	world	to	build	them	and	experiment	with	us	.
So	actually	now	on	this	website	,	we	have	18,000	people	.
And	we	have	window	farms	all	over	the	world	.
What	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	is	what	NASA	or	a	large	corporation	would	call	R	&	D	,	or	research	and	development	.
But	what	we	call	it	is	R	&	 D 	 - 	 I 	 - 	 Y 	 	,	or	research	and	develop	it	yourself	.
So	for	example	,	Jackson	came	along	and	 s 	 uggested 	 	that	we	use	air	pumps	instead	of	water	pumps	.
It	took	building	a	whole	bunch	of	systems	to	get	it	right	,	but	once	we	did	,	we	were	able	to	cut	our	carbon	footprint	 n 	 early 	 	in	half	.
Tony	in	Chicago	has	been	taking	on	growing	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	like	lots	of	other	window	farmers	,	and	he	's	been	able	to	get	his	 straw 	 berries 	 	to	fruit	for	nine	months	of	the	year	in	 low 	 - 	 light 	 	conditions	by	simply	changing	out	the	organic	 nutrient 	 s 	 	.
And	window	farmers	in	Finland	have	been	 custom 	 izing 	 	their	window	farms	for	the	dark	days	of	the	Finnish	 winter 	 s 	 	by	 out 	 fitting 	 	them	with	LED	grow	lights	that	they	're	now	making	open	source	and	part	of	the	project	.
So	window	farms	have	been	evolving	through	a	rapid	 version 	 ing 	 	process	similar	to	software	.
And	with	every	open	source	project	,	the	real	benefit	is	the	 inter 	 play 	 	between	the	specific	concerns	of	people	 custom 	 izing 	 	their	systems	for	their	own	particular	concerns	and	the	universal	concerns	.
So	my	core	team	and	I	are	able	to	concentrate	on	the	 improvement 	 s 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	benefit	everyone	.
And	we	're	able	to	look	out	for	the	needs	of	 new 	 comers 	 	.
So	for	 do 	 - 	 it 	 - 	 yourself 	 ers 	 	,	we	provide	free	,	very	 well 	 - 	 tested 	 	 instruction 	 s 	 	so	that	 any 	 one 	 	,	anywhere	around	the	world	,	can	build	one	of	these	systems	for	free	.
And	there	's	a	patent	pending	on	these	systems	as	well	that	's	held	by	the	community	.
And	to	fund	the	project	,	we	partner	to	create	products	that	we	then	sell	to	schools	and	to	 individual 	 s 	 	who	do	n't	have	time	to	build	their	own	systems	.
Now	within	our	community	,	a	certain	culture	has	appeared	.
In	our	culture	,	it	is	better	to	be	a	tester	who	 support 	 s 	 	someone	else	's	idea	than	it	is	to	be	just	the	idea	guy	.
What	we	get	out	of	this	project	is	we	get	support	for	our	own	work	,	as	well	as	an	experience	of	actually	 contribut 	 ing 	 	to	the	environmental	movement	in	a	way	other	than	just	 screw 	 ing 	 	in	new	light	bulbs	.
But	I	think	that	Eileen	 express 	 es 	 	best	what	we	 re 	 ally 	 	get	out	of	this	,	which	is	the	actual	joy	of	collaboration	.
So	she	 express 	 es 	 	here	what	it	's	like	to	see	someone	 half 	 way 	 	across	the	world	having	taken	your	idea	,	built	upon	it	and	then	 acknowledg 	 ing 	 	you	for	 contribut 	 ing 	 	.
If	we	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	see	the	kind	of	wide	consumer	behavior	change	that	we	're	all	talking	about	as	 environmental 	 ists 	 	and	food	people	,	maybe	we	just	need	to	ditch	the	term	``	consumer	''	and	get	behind	the	people	who	are	 do 	 ing 	 	stuff	.
Open	source	projects	tend	to	have	a	momentum	of	their	own	.
And	what	we	're	seeing	is	that	R	&	 D 	 - 	 I 	 - 	 Y 	 	has	moved	beyond	just	window	farms	and	 LED 	 s 	 	into	solar	panels	and	 aqua 	 ponic 	 	systems	.
And	we	're	building	upon	 innovation 	 s 	 	of	 generation 	 s 	 	who	went	before	us	.
And	we	're	looking	 a 	 head 	 	at	 generation 	 s 	 	who	 re 	 ally 	 	need	us	to	 re 	 tool 	 	our	lives	now	.
So	we	ask	that	you	join	us	in	 redis 	 covering 	 	the	value	of	citizens	united	,	and	to	declare	that	we	are	all	still	 pioneer 	 s 	 	.

In	this	prophetic	talk	from	2003	,	 robotic 	 ist 	 	Rodney	Brooks	talks	about	how	robots	are	going	to	work	their	way	into	our	lives	--	starting	with	toys	and	moving	into	household	chores	...	and	beyond	.

Rodney	Brooks	says	robots	will	invade	our	lives
What	I	want	to	tell	you	about	today	is	how	I	see	robots	 invad 	 ing 	 	our	lives	at	multiple	levels	,	over	multiple	 time 	 scales 	 	.
And	when	I	look	out	in	the	future	,	I	ca	n't	imagine	a	world	,	500	years	from	now	,	where	we	do	n't	have	robots	everywhere	.
Assuming	--	 despit 	 e 	 	all	the	dire	 prediction 	 s 	 	from	many	people	about	our	future	--	assuming	we	're	still	around	,	I	ca	n't	imagine	the	world	not	being	populated	with	robots	.
And	then	the	question	is	,	well	,	if	they	're	going	to	be	here	in	500	years	,	are	they	going	to	be	everywhere	 soon 	 er 	 	than	that	?
Are	they	going	to	be	around	in	50	years	?
Yeah	,	I	think	that	's	pretty	 like 	 ly 	 	--	there	's	going	to	be	lots	of	robots	everywhere	.
And	in	fact	I	think	that	's	going	to	be	a	lot	 soon 	 er 	 	than	that	.
I	think	we	're	sort	of	on	the	cusp	of	robots	becoming	common	,	and	I	think	we	're	sort	of	around	1978	or	1980	in	personal	computer	years	,	where	the	first	few	robots	are	starting	to	appear	.
 Computer 	 s 	 	sort	of	came	around	through	games	and	toys	.
And	you	know	,	the	first	computer	most	people	had	in	the	house	may	have	been	a	computer	to	play	Pong	,	a	little	 micro 	 processor 	 	embedded	,	and	then	other	games	that	came	after	that	.
And	we	're	starting	to	see	that	same	sort	of	thing	with	robots	:	LEGO	 Mind 	 storms 	 	,	Furbies	--	who	here	--	did	 any 	 one 	 	here	have	a	 Fur 	 by 	 	?
Yeah	,	there	's	38	million	of	them	sold	worldwide	.
They	are	pretty	common	.	And	they	're	a	little	tiny	robot	,	a	simple	robot	with	some	sensors	,	a	little	bit	of	processing	actuation	.
On	the	right	there	is	another	robot	doll	,	who	you	could	get	a	couple	of	years	ago	.
And	just	as	in	the	early	days	,	when	there	was	a	lot	of	sort	of	amateur	interaction	over	computers	,	you	can	now	get	various	hacking	kits	,	 how 	 - 	 to 	 - 	 hack 	 	books	.
And	on	the	left	there	is	a	platform	from	Evolution	Robotics	,	where	you	put	a	PC	on	,	and	you	program	this	thing	with	a	GUI	to	wander	around	your	house	and	do	various	stuff	.
And	then	there	's	a	higher	price	point	sort	of	robot	toys	--	the	Sony	Aibo	.	And	on	the	right	there	,	is	one	that	the	NEC	developed	,	the	 PaP 	 e 	 Ro 	 	,	which	I	do	n't	think	they	're	going	to	release	.
But	 never 	 theless 	 	,	those	 sort 	 s 	 	of	things	are	out	there	.
And	we	've	seen	,	over	the	last	two	or	three	years	,	 lawn 	 - 	 mow 	 ing 	 	robots	,	Husqvarna	on	the	bottom	,	Friendly	Robotics	on	top	there	,	an	Israeli	company	.
And	then	in	the	last	12	months	or	so	we	've	started	to	see	a	bunch	of	 home 	 - 	 cleaning 	 	robots	appear	.
The	top	left	one	is	a	very	nice	 home 	 - 	 cleaning 	 	robot	from	a	company	called	Dyson	,	in	the	U.K	.	Except	it	was	so	expensive	--	3,500	dollars	--	they	did	n't	release	it	.
But	at	the	bottom	left	,	you	see	 Electro 	 lux 	 	,	which	is	on	sale	.
Another	one	from	 Kar 	 cher 	 	.
At	the	bottom	right	is	one	that	I	built	in	my	lab	about	10	years	ago	,	and	we	finally	turned	that	into	a	product	.
And	let	me	just	show	you	that	.
We	're	going	to	give	this	away	I	think	,	Chris	said	,	after	the	talk	.
This	is	a	robot	that	you	can	go	out	and	buy	,	and	that	will	clean	up	your	floor	.
And	it	starts	off	sort	of	just	going	around	in	 ever 	 - 	 increasing 	 	circles	.
If	it	hits	something	--	you	people	see	that	?
Now	it	's	 do 	 ing 	 	 wall 	 - 	 following 	 	,	it	's	following	around	my	feet	to	clean	up	around	me	.	Let	's	see	,	let	's	--	oh	,	who	stole	my	Rice	 Krisp 	 ies 	 	?	They	stole	my	Rice	 Krisp 	 ies 	 	!
Do	n't	worry	,	relax	,	no	,	relax	,	it	's	a	robot	,	it	's	smart	!
See	,	the	 three 	 - 	 year 	 - 	 old 	 	kids	,	they	do	n't	worry	about	it	.
It	's	 grown 	 - 	 ups 	 	that	get	 re 	 ally 	 	upset	.
We	'll	just	put	some	crap	here	.
Okay	.
I	do	n't	know	if	you	see	--	so	,	I	put	a	bunch	of	Rice	 Krisp 	 ies 	 	there	,	I	put	some	pennies	,	let	's	just	shoot	it	at	that	,	see	if	it	 clean 	 s 	 	up	.
Yeah	,	OK	.	So	--	we	'll	leave	that	for	later	.
Part	of	the	trick	was	building	a	better	cleaning	mechanism	,	actually	;	the	intelligence	on	board	was	 fair 	 ly 	 	simple	.
And	that	's	true	with	a	lot	of	robots	.
We	've	all	,	I	think	,	become	,	sort	of	computational	 chauvin 	 ists 	 	,	and	think	that	computation	is	everything	,	but	the	mechanics	still	matter	.
Here	's	another	robot	,	the	 Pack 	 Bot 	 	,	that	we	've	been	building	for	a	bunch	of	years	.
It	's	a	military	surveillance	robot	,	to	go	in	 a 	 head 	 	of	troops	--	looking	at	caves	,	for	instance	.
But	we	had	to	make	it	 fair 	 ly 	 	robust	,	much	more	robust	than	the	robots	we	build	in	our	labs	.
On	board	that	robot	is	a	PC	running	Linux	.
It	can	 with 	 stand 	 	a	400G	shock	.	The	robot	has	local	intelligence	:	it	can	flip	itself	over	,	can	get	itself	into	communication	range	,	can	go	 up 	 stairs 	 	by	itself	,	et	cetera	.
Okay	,	so	it	's	 do 	 ing 	 	local	navigation	there	.
A	soldier	gives	it	a	command	to	go	 up 	 stairs 	 	,	and	it	does	.
That	was	not	a	controlled	descent	.
Now	it	's	going	to	head	off	.
And	the	big	breakthrough	for	these	robots	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	was	September	11th	.
We	had	the	robots	down	at	the	World	Trade	Center	late	that	evening	.
Could	n't	do	a	lot	in	the	main	rubble	pile	,	things	were	just	too	--	there	was	nothing	left	to	do	.
But	we	did	go	into	all	the	 surround 	 ing 	 	buildings	that	had	been	 evacuate 	 d 	 	,	and	 search 	 ed 	 	for	possible	survivors	in	the	buildings	that	were	too	dangerous	to	go	into	.
Let	's	run	this	video	.
Reporter	:	...	battlefield	 companion 	 s 	 	are	 help 	 ing 	 	to	reduce	the	combat	risks	.
Nick	Robertson	has	that	story	.
Rodney	Brooks	:	Can	we	have	another	one	of	these	?
Okay	,	good	.
So	,	this	is	a	corporal	who	had	seen	a	robot	two	weeks	 previousl 	 y 	 	.
He	's	 s 	 ending 	 	robots	into	caves	,	looking	at	what	's	going	on	.
The	robot	's	being	totally	autonomous	.
The	worst	thing	that	's	happened	in	the	cave	so	far	was	one	of	the	robots	fell	down	ten	meters	.
So	one	year	ago	,	the	US	military	did	n't	have	these	robots	.
Now	they	're	on	active	duty	in	Afghanistan	every	day	.
And	that	's	one	of	the	reasons	they	say	a	robot	invasion	is	happening	.
There	's	a	sea	change	happening	in	how	--	where	technology	's	going	.
Thanks	.
And	over	the	next	couple	of	months	,	we	're	going	to	be	 s 	 ending 	 	robots	in	production	down	producing	oil	wells	to	get	that	last	few	years	of	oil	out	of	the	ground	.
Very	 hostil 	 e 	 	 environment 	 s 	 	,	150˚	C	,	10,000	PSI	.
 Autonom 	 ous 	 	robots	going	down	,	 do 	 ing 	 	this	sort	of	work	.
But	robots	like	this	,	they	're	a	little	hard	to	program	.
How	,	in	the	future	,	are	we	going	to	program	our	robots	and	make	them	easier	to	use	?
And	I	want	to	actually	use	a	robot	here	--	a	robot	named	Chris	--	stand	up	.	Yeah	.	Okay	.
Come	over	here	.	Now	notice	,	he	 think 	 s 	 	robots	have	to	be	a	bit	stiff	.
He	sort	of	does	that	.	But	I	'm	going	to	--	Chris	Anderson	:	I	'm	just	British	.	RB	:	Oh	.
I	'm	going	to	show	this	robot	a	task	.	It	's	a	very	complex	task	.
Now	notice	,	he	 no 	 dded 	 	there	,	he	was	giving	me	some	indication	he	was	understanding	the	flow	of	communication	.
And	if	I	'd	said	something	 complete 	 ly 	 	bizarre	he	would	have	looked	 ask 	 ance 	 	at	me	,	and	regulated	the	conversation	.
So	now	I	brought	this	up	in	front	of	him	.
I	'd	looked	at	his	eyes	,	and	I	saw	his	eyes	looked	at	this	bottle	top	.
And	I	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	this	task	here	,	and	he	's	checking	up	.
His	eyes	are	going	back	and	forth	up	to	me	,	to	see	what	I	'm	looking	at	--	so	we	've	got	shared	attention	.
And	so	I	do	this	task	,	and	he	looks	,	and	he	looks	to	me	to	see	what	's	happening	next	.	And	now	I	'll	give	him	the	bottle	,	and	we	'll	see	if	he	can	do	the	task	.	Can	you	do	that	?
Okay	.	He	's	pretty	good	.	Yeah	.	Good	,	good	,	good	.
I	did	n't	show	you	how	to	do	that	.
Now	see	if	you	can	put	it	back	together	.
And	he	 think 	 s 	 	a	robot	has	to	be	 re 	 ally 	 	slow	.
Good	robot	,	that	's	good	.
So	we	saw	a	bunch	of	things	there	.
We	saw	when	we	're	 interact 	 ing 	 	,	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	show	someone	how	to	do	something	,	we	direct	their	visual	attention	.
The	other	thing	 communicate 	 s 	 	their	internal	state	to	us	,	whether	he	's	understanding	or	not	,	 regulate 	 s 	 	a	social	interaction	.
There	was	shared	attention	looking	at	the	same	sort	of	thing	,	and	 recogniz 	 ing 	 	 social 	 ly 	 	 communicate 	 d 	 	reinforcement	at	the	end	.
And	we	've	been	 try 	 ing 	 	to	put	that	into	our	lab	robots	because	we	think	this	is	how	you	're	going	to	want	to	interact	with	robots	in	the	future	.
I	just	want	to	show	you	one	technical	diagram	here	.
The	most	important	thing	for	building	a	robot	that	you	can	interact	with	 social 	 ly 	 	is	its	visual	attention	system	.
Because	what	it	 pay 	 s 	 	attention	to	is	what	it	's	seeing	and	 interact 	 ing 	 	with	,	and	what	you	're	understanding	what	it	's	 do 	 ing 	 	.
So	in	the	videos	I	'm	about	to	show	you	,	you	're	going	to	see	a	visual	attention	system	on	a	robot	which	has	--	it	looks	for	skin	tone	in	HSV	space	,	so	it	works	across	all	human	 coloring 	 s 	 	.
It	looks	for	highly	saturated	colors	,	from	toys	.
And	it	looks	for	things	that	move	around	.
And	it	weights	those	together	into	an	attention	window	,	and	it	looks	for	the	 highest 	 - 	 scoring 	 	place	--	the	stuff	where	the	most	 interest 	 ing 	 	stuff	is	happening	--	and	that	is	what	its	eyes	then	segue	to	.
And	it	looks	right	at	that	.
At	the	same	time	,	some	 top 	 - 	 down 	 	sort	of	stuff	:	might	decide	that	it	's	lonely	and	look	for	skin	tone	,	or	might	decide	that	it	's	bored	and	look	for	a	toy	to	play	with	.
And	so	these	weights	change	.
And	over	here	on	the	right	,	this	is	what	we	call	the	Steven	Spielberg	memorial	module	.
Did	people	see	the	movie	``	AI	''	?
RB	:	Yeah	,	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	,	but	--	remember	,	especially	when	Haley	Joel	 Os 	 ment 	 	,	the	little	robot	,	looked	at	the	blue	fairy	for	2,000	years	without	taking	his	eyes	off	it	?
Well	,	this	 get 	 s 	 	rid	of	that	,	because	this	is	a	 habitu 	 ation 	 	Gaussian	that	 get 	 s 	 	negative	,	and	more	and	more	intense	as	it	looks	at	one	thing	.
And	it	 get 	 s 	 	bored	,	so	it	will	then	look	away	at	something	else	.
So	,	once	you	've	got	that	--	and	here	's	a	robot	,	here	's	 Kis 	 met 	 	,	looking	around	for	a	toy	.	You	can	tell	what	it	's	looking	at	.
You	can	estimate	its	gaze	direction	from	those	 eyeball 	 s 	 	covering	its	camera	,	and	you	can	tell	when	it	's	actually	seeing	the	toy	.
And	it	's	got	a	little	bit	of	an	emotional	response	here	.
But	it	's	still	going	to	pay	attention	if	something	more	significant	comes	into	its	field	of	view	--	such	as	Cynthia	 Brea 	 zeal 	 	,	the	builder	of	this	robot	,	from	the	right	.
It	 see 	 s 	 	her	,	 pay 	 s 	 	attention	to	her	.
 Kis 	 met 	 	has	an	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	,	 three 	 - 	 dimensional 	 	emotional	space	,	a	vector	space	,	of	where	it	is	 emotional 	 ly 	 	.
And	at	different	places	in	that	space	,	it	 express 	 es 	 	--	can	we	have	the	volume	on	here	?
Can	you	hear	that	now	,	out	there	?
 Kis 	 met 	 	:	Do	you	 re 	 ally 	 	think	so	?	Do	you	 re 	 ally 	 	think	so	?
Do	you	 re 	 ally 	 	think	so	?
RB	:	So	it	's	 express 	 ing 	 	its	emotion	through	its	face	and	the	prosody	in	its	voice	.
And	when	I	was	dealing	with	my	robot	over	here	,	Chris	,	the	robot	,	was	measuring	the	prosody	in	my	voice	,	and	so	we	have	the	robot	measure	prosody	for	four	basic	messages	that	mothers	give	their	children	 pre 	 - 	 linguistic 	 ally 	 	.
Here	we	've	got	naive	subjects	praising	the	robot	:	Voice	:	Nice	robot	.
You	're	such	a	cute	little	robot	.
RB	:	And	the	robot	's	reacting	 appropriate 	 ly 	 	.
Voice	:	...	very	good	,	 Kis 	 met 	 	.
Voice	:	Look	at	my	smile	.
RB	:	It	 s 	 miles 	 	.	She	 imitat 	 es 	 	the	smile	.	This	 happen 	 s 	 	a	lot	.
These	are	naive	subjects	.
Here	we	asked	them	to	get	the	robot	's	attention	and	indicate	when	they	have	the	robot	's	attention	.
Voice	:	Hey	,	 Kis 	 met 	 	,	ah	,	there	it	is	.
RB	:	So	she	 realiz 	 es 	 	she	has	the	robot	's	attention	.
Voice	:	 Kis 	 met 	 	,	do	you	like	the	toy	?	Oh	.
RB	:	Now	,	here	they	're	asked	to	prohibit	the	robot	,	and	this	first	woman	 re 	 ally 	 	 push 	 es 	 	the	robot	into	an	emotional	corner	.
Voice	:	No	.	No	.	You	're	not	to	do	that	.	No	.
Not	appropriate	.	No	.	No	.
RB	:	I	'm	going	to	leave	it	at	that	.
We	put	that	together	.	Then	we	put	in	turn	taking	.
When	we	talk	to	someone	,	we	talk	.
Then	we	sort	of	raise	our	 eyebrow 	 s 	 	,	move	our	eyes	,	give	the	other	person	the	idea	it	's	their	turn	to	talk	.
And	then	they	talk	,	and	then	we	pass	the	baton	back	and	forth	between	each	other	.
So	we	put	this	in	the	robot	.
We	got	a	bunch	of	naive	subjects	in	,	we	did	n't	tell	them	anything	about	the	robot	,	sat	them	down	in	front	of	the	robot	and	said	,	talk	to	the	robot	.
Now	what	they	did	n't	know	was	,	the	robot	was	n't	understanding	a	word	they	said	,	and	that	the	robot	was	n't	speaking	English	.
It	was	just	saying	random	English	 phoneme 	 s 	 	.
And	I	want	you	to	watch	 care 	 fully 	 	,	at	the	beginning	of	this	,	where	this	person	,	Ritchie	,	who	happened	to	talk	to	the	robot	for	25	minutes	--	--	says	,	``	I	want	to	show	you	something	.
I	want	to	show	you	my	watch	.	''
And	he	 bring 	 s 	 	the	watch	center	,	into	the	robot	's	field	of	vision	,	points	to	it	,	gives	it	a	motion	cue	,	and	the	robot	looks	at	the	watch	quite	 successful 	 ly 	 	.
We	do	n't	know	whether	he	understood	or	not	that	the	robot	--	Notice	the	 turn 	 - 	 taking 	 	.
Ritchie	:	OK	,	I	want	to	show	you	something	.	OK	,	this	is	a	watch	that	my	girlfriend	gave	me	.
Robot	:	Oh	,	cool	.
Ritchie	:	Yeah	,	look	,	it	's	got	a	little	blue	light	in	it	too	.	I	almost	lost	it	this	week	.
RB	:	So	it	's	making	eye	contact	with	him	,	following	his	eyes	.
Ritchie	:	Can	you	do	the	same	thing	?	Robot	:	Yeah	,	sure	.
RB	:	And	they	 successful 	 ly 	 	have	that	sort	of	communication	.
And	here	's	another	aspect	of	the	 sort 	 s 	 	of	things	that	Chris	and	I	were	 do 	 ing 	 	.
This	is	another	robot	,	Cog	.
They	first	make	eye	contact	,	and	then	,	when	Christie	looks	over	at	this	toy	,	the	robot	estimates	her	gaze	direction	and	looks	at	the	same	thing	that	she	's	looking	at	.
So	we	're	going	to	see	more	and	more	of	this	sort	of	robot	over	the	next	few	years	in	labs	.
But	then	the	big	questions	,	two	big	questions	that	people	ask	me	are	:	if	we	make	these	robots	more	and	more	 human 	 - 	 like 	 	,	will	we	accept	them	,	will	we	--	will	they	need	rights	 eventual 	 ly 	 	?
And	the	other	question	people	ask	me	is	,	will	they	want	to	take	over	?
And	on	the	first	--	you	know	,	this	has	been	a	very	Hollywood	theme	with	lots	of	movies	.	You	probably	 recogniz 	 e 	 	these	characters	here	--	where	in	each	of	these	cases	,	the	robots	want	more	respect	.
Well	,	do	you	ever	need	to	give	robots	respect	?
They	're	just	machines	,	after	all	.
But	I	think	,	you	know	,	we	have	to	accept	that	we	are	just	machines	.
After	all	,	that	's	 certain 	 ly 	 	what	modern	molecular	biology	says	about	us	.
You	do	n't	see	a	description	of	how	,	you	know	,	Molecule	A	,	you	know	,	comes	up	and	docks	with	this	other	molecule	.
And	it	's	moving	forward	,	you	know	,	 pro 	 pelled 	 	by	various	charges	,	and	then	the	soul	steps	in	and	 tweak 	 s 	 	those	molecules	so	that	they	connect	.
It	's	all	 mechan 	 istic 	 	.	We	are	mechanism	.
If	we	are	machines	,	then	in	principle	at	least	,	we	should	be	able	to	build	machines	out	of	other	stuff	,	which	are	just	as	alive	as	we	are	.
But	I	think	for	us	to	admit	that	,	we	have	to	give	up	on	our	 special 	 - 	 ness 	 	,	in	a	certain	way	.
And	we	've	had	the	retreat	from	 special 	 - 	 ness 	 	under	the	barrage	of	science	and	technology	many	times	over	the	last	few	hundred	years	,	at	least	.
500	years	ago	we	had	to	give	up	the	idea	that	we	are	the	center	of	the	universe	when	the	earth	started	to	go	around	the	sun	;	150	years	ago	,	with	Darwin	,	we	had	to	give	up	the	idea	we	were	different	from	animals	.
And	to	imagine	--	you	know	,	it	's	always	hard	for	us	.
Recently	we	've	been	 batter 	 ed 	 	with	the	idea	that	maybe	we	did	n't	even	have	our	own	creation	event	,	here	on	earth	,	which	people	did	n't	like	much	.	And	then	the	human	genome	said	,	maybe	we	only	have	35,000	genes	.	And	that	was	 re 	 ally 	 	--	people	did	n't	like	that	,	we	've	got	more	genes	than	that	.
We	do	n't	like	to	give	up	our	 special 	 - 	 ness 	 	,	so	,	you	know	,	having	the	idea	that	robots	could	 re 	 ally 	 	have	emotions	,	or	that	robots	could	be	living	creatures	--	I	think	is	going	to	be	hard	for	us	to	accept	.
But	we	're	going	to	come	to	accept	it	over	the	next	50	years	or	so	.
And	the	second	question	is	,	will	the	machines	want	to	take	over	?
And	here	the	standard	scenario	is	that	we	create	these	things	,	they	grow	,	we	 nurtur 	 e 	 	them	,	they	learn	a	lot	from	us	,	and	then	they	start	to	decide	that	we	're	pretty	boring	,	slow	.
They	want	to	take	over	from	us	.
And	for	those	of	you	that	have	 teenager 	 s 	 	,	you	know	what	that	's	like	.
But	Hollywood	 extend 	 s 	 	it	to	the	robots	.
And	the	question	is	,	you	know	,	will	someone	 accidental 	 ly 	 	build	a	robot	that	takes	over	from	us	?
And	that	's	sort	of	like	this	lone	guy	in	the	backyard	,	you	know	--	``	I	 accidental 	 ly 	 	built	a	747	.	''
I	do	n't	think	that	's	going	to	happen	.
And	I	do	n't	think	--	--	I	do	n't	think	we	're	going	to	 deliberate 	 ly 	 	build	robots	that	we	're	 un 	 comfortabl 	 e 	 	with	.
We	'll	--	you	know	,	they	're	not	going	to	have	a	super	bad	robot	.
Before	that	has	to	come	to	be	a	 mild 	 ly 	 	bad	robot	,	and	before	that	a	not	so	bad	robot	.
And	we	're	just	not	going	to	let	it	go	that	way	.
So	,	I	think	I	'm	going	to	leave	it	at	that	:	the	robots	are	coming	,	we	do	n't	have	too	much	to	worry	about	,	it	's	going	to	be	a	lot	of	fun	,	and	I	hope	you	all	enjoy	the	journey	over	the	next	50	years	.

Alexis	 O 	 hanian 	 	:	How	to	make	a	splash	in	social	media
So	,	now	,	there	are	a	lot	of	web	2.0	 consultant 	 s 	 	who	make	a	lot	of	money	.
In	fact	,	they	make	their	 living 	 s 	 	on	this	kind	of	stuff	.
I	'm	going	to	try	and	save	you	all	the	time	and	all	the	money	and	go	through	it	in	the	next	three	minutes	,	so	bear	with	me	.
Started	a	website	back	in	2005	,	with	a	few	friends	of	mine	,	called	 Reddit 	 .com 	 	.
That	's	what	you	'd	call	a	social	news	website	.
Basically	all	that	means	is	that	the	democratic	front	page	is	the	best	stuff	on	the	web	.	You	find	some	 interest 	 ing 	 	content	,	say	a	 TED 	 Talk 	 	,	submit	it	to	Reddit	,	and	the	community	of	your	peers	will	vote	it	up	if	they	like	it	,	vote	it	down	if	they	do	n't	.
And	that	 create 	 s 	 	the	front	page	.	It	's	always	rising	,	 fall 	 ing 	 	,	always	changing	.
About	a	half	million	people	visit	every	day	.	But	this	is	n't	about	Reddit	.
This	is	actually	about	 discover 	 ing 	 	new	things	that	pop	up	on	the	web	.
Because	in	the	last	four	years	we	've	seen	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 meme 	 s 	 	,	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	trends	get	born	right	on	our	front	page	.
But	this	is	n't	even	about	Reddit	itself	.
It	's	actually	about	 hump 	 back 	 	whales	.
Well	,	okay	,	 technical 	 ly 	 	it	's	actually	about	 Green 	 peace 	 	,	which	is	an	environmental	organization	that	wanted	to	stop	the	Japanese	government	on	their	whaling	campaign	.
These	 hump 	 back 	 	whales	were	getting	killed	.
They	wanted	to	put	an	end	to	it	.	And	one	of	the	ways	they	wanted	to	do	it	was	to	put	a	tracking	chip	inside	one	of	these	 hump 	 back 	 	whales	.
But	to	 re 	 ally 	 	kind	of	 person 	 ify 	 	the	movement	,	they	wanted	to	name	it	.
So	,	in	true	web	fashion	they	put	together	a	poll	where	they	had	a	bunch	of	very	 erudit 	 e 	 	,	very	 thought 	 ful 	 	,	cultured	names	.
I	believe	this	is	a	Farsi	word	for	``	immortal	.	''
I	think	this	means	``	divine	power	of	the	ocean	''	in	a	 Polynesia 	 n 	 	language	.
And	then	there	was	this	:	Mister	 Splash 	 y 	 	Pants	.
And	this	,	this	was	special	.	Mister	Pants	,	or	 Splash 	 y 	 	,	to	his	friends	,	was	very	popular	on	the	Internet	.
In	fact	,	someone	on	Reddit	thought	,	``	Oh	,	what	a	great	thing	,	we	should	all	vote	this	up	.	''
And	,	you	know	,	 Reddi 	 tors 	 	 respond 	 ed 	 	and	all	agreed	.
So	,	the	voting	started	and	we	actually	got	behind	it	 our 	 selves 	 	.
We	changed	our	logo	,	for	the	day	,	from	the	alien	to	a	 Splash 	 y 	 	,	to	sort	of	help	the	cause	.
And	it	was	n't	long	before	other	sites	like	Fark	and	Boing	Boing	and	the	rest	of	the	Internet	started	saying	,	``	Yes	!	We	love	 Splash 	 y 	 	Pants	.	''
So	,	it	went	from	about	five	percent	,	which	was	when	this	meme	started	,	to	70	percent	at	the	end	of	voting	.
Which	is	pretty	 impressiv 	 e 	 	right	?	We	won	!	Mister	 Splash 	 y 	 	Pants	was	chosen	.	Hmm	,	just	 kidd 	 ing 	 	.	Okay	.
So	,	 Green 	 peace 	 	actually	was	n't	that	crazy	about	it	,	because	they	wanted	one	of	their	more	 thought 	 ful 	 	names	to	win	.
So	they	said	,	``	No	,	no	,	just	 kidd 	 ing 	 	.	We	'll	give	it	another	week	of	voting	.	''
Well	,	that	got	us	a	little	angry	.
So	,	we	changed	it	to	 Fight 	 in 	 	'	 Splash 	 y 	 	.
And	the	Reddit	community	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	and	the	rest	of	the	internet	,	rather	,	 re 	 ally 	 	got	behind	this	.
Facebook	groups	were	getting	created	.	Facebook	applications	were	getting	created	.
The	idea	was	,	``	Vote	your	conscience	,	''	vote	for	Mister	 Splash 	 y 	 	Pants	.
And	people	were	putting	up	signs	in	the	real	world	--	--	about	this	whale	.
And	this	was	the	final	vote	.	When	all	was	cleared	...
78	percent	of	the	votes	,	and	to	give	you	an	idea	of	the	 land 	 slide 	 	,	the	next	highest	name	 pull 	 ed 	 	in	three	.	Okay	?
So	,	there	was	a	clear	lesson	here	.
And	that	was	that	the	Internet	loves	Mister	 Splash 	 y 	 	Pants	.
Which	is	obvious	.	It	's	a	great	name	.
Everyone	 want 	 s 	 	to	hear	their	news	anchor	say	,	``	Mister	 Splash 	 y 	 	Pants	.	''
And	I	think	that	's	what	 help 	 ed 	 	drive	this	.
But	what	was	cool	was	that	the	 re 	 percussion 	 s 	 	now	for	 Green 	 peace 	 	was	,	they	created	an	entire	marketing	campaign	around	it	.
They	sell	Mister	 Splash 	 y 	 	Pants	shirts	and	pins	.
They	even	created	an	 e 	 - 	 card 	 	so	you	could	send	your	friend	a	dancing	 Splash 	 y 	 	.
But	what	was	even	more	important	was	the	fact	that	they	actually	 accomplish 	 ed 	 	their	mission	.	The	Japanese	government	called	off	their	whaling	expedition	.	Mission	 accomplish 	 ed 	 	.
 Green 	 peace 	 	was	 thrill 	 ed 	 	.	The	whales	were	happy	.	That	's	a	quote	.
And	actually	,	 Reddi 	 tors 	 	in	the	Internet	community	were	happy	to	participate	,	but	they	were	n't	whale	lovers	.
A	few	of	them	 certain 	 ly 	 	were	.	But	we	're	talking	about	a	lot	of	people	who	were	just	 re 	 ally 	 	interested	and	 re 	 ally 	 	caught	up	in	this	great	meme	,	and	in	fact	someone	from	 Green 	 peace 	 	came	back	on	the	site	and	 thank 	 ed 	 	Reddit	for	its	participation	.
But	this	was	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	out	of	 altru 	 ism 	 	.	This	was	just	out	of	interest	in	 do 	 ing 	 	something	cool	.
And	this	is	kind	of	how	the	Internet	works	.
This	is	that	great	big	secret	.	Because	the	Internet	provides	this	level	playing	field	.
Your	link	is	just	as	good	as	your	link	,	which	is	just	as	good	as	my	link	.	As	long	as	we	have	a	browser	,	 any 	 one 	 	can	get	to	any	website	no	matter	how	big	a	budget	you	have	.
That	is	,	as	long	as	you	can	keep	net	neutrality	in	place	.
The	other	important	thing	is	that	it	costs	nothing	to	get	that	content	online	now	.
There	are	so	many	great	publishing	tools	that	are	available	,	it	only	takes	a	few	minutes	of	your	time	now	to	actually	produce	something	.
And	the	cost	of	iteration	is	so	cheap	that	you	might	as	well	give	it	a	go	.
And	if	you	do	,	be	genuine	about	it	.	Be	honest	.	Be	up	front	.
And	one	of	the	great	lessons	that	 Green 	 peace 	 	actually	learned	was	that	it	's	okay	to	lose	control	.
It	's	okay	to	take	yourself	a	little	less	 serious 	 ly 	 	,	given	that	,	even	though	it	's	a	very	serious	cause	,	you	could	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	achieve	your	final	goal	.
And	that	's	the	final	message	that	I	want	to	share	with	all	of	you	--	that	you	can	do	well	online	.
But	no	 long 	 er 	 	is	the	message	going	to	be	coming	from	just	the	top	down	.
If	you	want	to	succeed	you	've	got	to	be	okay	to	just	lose	control	.
Thank	you	.

Imagine	it	's	late	1990	,	and	you	've	just	met	a	nice	young	man	named	Tim	 Berner 	 s 	 - 	 Lee 	 	,	who	starts	telling	you	about	his	proposed	system	called	the	World	Wide	Web	.	Ian	Ritchie	was	there	.	And	...	he	did	n't	buy	it	.	A	short	story	about	information	,	connectivity	and	learning	from	 mistake 	 s 	 	.
business	,	history	,	technology	,	web
1244
Ian	Ritchie	:	The	day	I	turned	down	Tim	 Berner 	 s 	 - 	 Lee 	 
Well	we	all	know	the	World	Wide	Web	has	 absolute 	 ly 	 	transformed	publishing	,	broadcasting	,	commerce	and	social	connectivity	,	but	where	did	it	all	come	from	?
And	I	'll	quote	three	people	:	 Van 	 ne 	 var 	 	Bush	,	Doug	 Engel 	 bart 	 	and	Tim	 Berner 	 s 	 - 	 Lee 	 	.
So	let	's	just	run	through	these	guys	.
This	is	 Van 	 ne 	 var 	 	Bush	.
 Van 	 ne 	 var 	 	Bush	was	the	U.S.	government	's	chief	scientific	adviser	during	the	war	.
And	in	1945	,	he	published	an	article	in	a	magazine	called	Atlantic	Monthly	.
And	the	article	was	called	``	As	We	May	Think	.	''
And	what	 Van 	 ne 	 var 	 	Bush	was	saying	was	the	way	we	use	information	is	broken	.
We	do	n't	work	in	terms	of	libraries	and	catalog	systems	and	so	forth	.
The	brain	works	by	association	.
With	one	item	in	its	thought	,	it	snaps	 instant 	 ly 	 	to	the	next	item	.
And	the	way	information	is	structured	is	totally	 in 	 capable 	 	of	keeping	up	with	this	process	.
And	so	he	 s 	 uggested 	 	a	machine	,	and	he	called	it	the	 me 	 mex 	 	.
And	the	 me 	 mex 	 	would	link	information	,	one	piece	of	information	to	a	related	piece	of	information	and	so	forth	.
Now	this	was	in	1945	.
A	computer	in	those	days	was	something	the	secret	services	used	to	use	for	code	breaking	.
And	nobody	knew	anything	about	it	.
So	this	was	before	the	computer	was	 invent 	 ed 	 	.
And	he	proposed	this	machine	called	the	 me 	 mex 	 	.
And	he	had	a	platform	where	you	linked	information	to	other	information	,	and	then	you	could	call	it	up	at	will	.
So	spinning	forward	,	one	of	the	guys	who	read	this	article	was	a	guy	called	Doug	 Engel 	 bart 	 	,	and	he	was	a	U.S.	Air	Force	officer	.
And	he	was	reading	it	in	their	library	in	the	Far	East	.
And	he	was	so	inspired	by	this	article	,	it	kind	of	directed	the	rest	of	his	life	.
And	by	the	 mid 	 - 	 60 	 s 	 	,	he	was	able	to	put	this	into	action	when	he	worked	at	the	Stanford	Research	Lab	in	California	.
He	built	a	system	.
The	system	was	designed	to	augment	human	intelligence	,	it	was	called	.
And	in	a	 pre 	 monition 	 	of	today	's	world	of	cloud	computing	and	 software 	 s 	 	of	service	,	his	system	was	called	NLS	for	 o 	 N 	 - 	 Line 	 	System	.
And	this	is	Doug	 Engel 	 bart 	 	.
He	was	giving	a	presentation	at	the	Fall	Joint	Computer	Conference	in	1968	.
What	he	 show 	 ed 	 	--	he	sat	on	a	stage	like	this	,	and	he	 demonstrat 	 ed 	 	this	system	.
He	had	his	head	mic	like	I	've	got	.
And	he	works	this	system	.
And	you	can	see	,	he	's	working	between	documents	and	graphics	and	so	forth	.
And	he	's	driving	it	all	with	this	platform	here	,	with	a	 five 	 - 	 finger 	 	keyboard	and	the	world	's	first	computer	mouse	,	which	he	 s 	 pecially 	 	designed	in	order	to	do	this	system	.
So	this	is	where	the	mouse	came	from	as	well	.
So	this	is	Doug	 Engel 	 bart 	 	.
The	trouble	with	Doug	 Engel 	 bart 	 	's	system	was	that	the	computers	in	those	days	cost	several	million	pounds	.
So	for	a	personal	computer	,	a	few	million	pounds	was	like	having	a	personal	jet	plane	;	it	was	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	very	practical	.
But	spin	on	to	the	80s	when	personal	computers	did	arrive	,	then	there	was	room	for	this	kind	of	system	on	personal	computers	.
And	my	company	,	OWL	built	a	system	called	Guide	for	the	Apple	Macintosh	.
And	we	delivered	the	world	's	first	 hyper 	 text 	 	system	.
And	this	began	to	get	a	head	of	steam	.
Apple	introduced	a	thing	called	 Hyper 	 Card 	 	,	and	they	made	a	bit	of	a	fuss	about	it	.
They	had	a	12-page	supplement	in	the	Wall	Street	Journal	the	day	it	launched	.
The	 magazine 	 s 	 	started	to	cover	it	.
Byte	magazine	and	Communications	at	the	ACM	had	special	issues	covering	 hyper 	 text 	 	.
We	developed	a	PC	version	of	this	product	as	well	as	the	Macintosh	version	.
And	our	PC	version	became	quite	mature	.
These	are	some	examples	of	this	system	in	action	in	the	late	80s	.
You	were	able	to	deliver	documents	,	were	able	to	do	it	over	networks	.
We	developed	a	system	such	that	it	had	a	 mark 	 up 	 	language	based	on	html	.
We	called	it	 h 	 ml 	 	:	 hyper 	 text 	 	 mark 	 up 	 	language	.
And	the	system	was	capable	of	 do 	 ing 	 	very	,	very	large	documentation	systems	over	computer	networks	.
So	I	took	this	system	to	a	trade	show	in	Versailles	near	Paris	in	late	November	1990	.
And	I	was	 approach 	 ed 	 	by	a	nice	young	man	called	Tim	 Berner 	 s 	 - 	 Lee 	 	who	said	,	``	Are	you	Ian	Ritchie	?	''	and	I	said	,	``	Yeah	.	''
And	he	said	,	``	I	need	to	talk	to	you	.	''
And	he	told	me	about	his	proposed	system	called	the	World	Wide	Web	.
And	I	thought	,	well	,	that	's	got	a	pretentious	name	,	especially	since	the	whole	system	ran	on	his	computer	in	his	office	.
But	he	was	 complete 	 ly 	 	 convinc 	 ed 	 	that	his	World	Wide	Web	would	take	over	the	world	one	day	.
And	he	tried	to	 persuad 	 e 	 	me	to	write	the	browser	for	it	,	because	his	system	did	n't	have	any	graphics	or	fonts	or	layout	or	anything	;	it	was	just	plain	text	.
I	thought	,	well	,	you	know	,	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	but	a	guy	from	CERN	,	he	's	not	going	to	do	this	.
So	we	did	n't	do	it	.
In	the	next	couple	of	years	,	the	 hyper 	 text 	 	community	did	n't	 recogniz 	 e 	 	him	either	.
In	1992	,	his	paper	was	 reject 	 ed 	 	for	the	 Hyper 	 text 	 	Conference	.
In	1993	,	there	was	a	table	at	the	conference	in	Seattle	,	and	a	guy	called	Marc	 Andre 	 essen 	 	was	 demonstrat 	 ing 	 	his	little	browser	for	the	World	Wide	Web	.
And	I	saw	it	,	and	I	thought	,	yep	,	that	's	it	.
And	the	very	next	year	,	in	1994	,	we	had	the	conference	here	in	Edinburgh	,	and	I	had	no	opposition	in	having	Tim	 Berner 	 s 	 - 	 Lee 	 	as	the	keynote	speaker	.
So	that	puts	me	in	pretty	 i 	 llustrious 	 	company	.
There	was	a	guy	called	Dick	Rowe	who	was	at	Decca	Records	and	turned	down	The	 Beatle 	 s 	 	.
There	was	a	guy	called	Gary	 Kil 	 dall 	 	who	went	flying	his	plane	when	IBM	came	looking	for	an	operating	system	for	the	IBM	PC	,	and	he	was	n't	there	,	so	they	went	back	to	see	Bill	Gates	.
And	the	12	 publisher 	 s 	 	who	turned	down	 J 	 .K. 	 	 Row 	 ling 	 	's	Harry	Potter	,	I	guess	.
On	the	other	hand	,	there	's	Marc	 Andre 	 essen 	 	who	wrote	the	world	's	first	browser	for	the	World	Wide	Web	.
And	according	to	Fortune	magazine	,	he	's	worth	700	million	dollars	.
But	is	he	happy	?

As	a	 cyber 	 - 	 magician 	 	,	I	 combin 	 e 	 	elements	of	illusion	and	science	to	give	us	a	feel	of	how	future	technologies	might	be	 experience 	 d 	 	.
You	've	probably	all	heard	of	Google	's	Project	Glass	.
It	's	new	technology	.	You	look	through	them	and	the	world	you	see	is	augmented	with	data	:	names	of	places	,	 monument 	 s 	 	,	buildings	,	maybe	one	day	even	the	names	of	the	 stranger 	 s 	 	that	pass	you	on	the	street	.
So	these	are	my	illusion	glasses	.
They	're	a	little	 bigg 	 er 	 	.	They	're	a	prototype	.
And	when	you	look	through	them	,	you	get	a	 glimps 	 e 	 	into	the	mind	of	the	 cyber 	 - 	 illusion 	 ist 	 	.
Let	me	show	you	what	I	mean	.
All	we	need	is	a	playing	card	.	Any	card	will	do	.
Like	this	.	And	let	me	mark	it	so	we	can	 recogniz 	 e 	 	it	when	we	see	it	again	.
All	right	.	Very	significant	mark	.
And	let	's	put	it	back	into	the	deck	,	 s 	 omewhere 	 	in	the	middle	,	and	let	's	get	started	.
Voice	:	System	ready	.	 Acqui 	 ring 	 	image	.
Marco	Tempest	:	For	those	of	you	who	do	n't	play	cards	,	a	deck	of	cards	is	made	up	of	four	different	suits	:	hearts	,	clubs	,	 diamond 	 s 	 	and	spades	.
The	cards	are	 a 	 mongst 	 	the	oldest	of	symbols	,	and	have	been	 interpret 	 ed 	 	in	many	different	ways	.
Now	,	some	say	that	the	four	suits	represent	the	four	seasons	.
There	's	spring	,	summer	,	autumn	and	â	Voice	:	My	 favorit 	 e 	 	season	is	winter	.	MT	:	Well	yeah	,	mine	too	.
Winter	is	like	magic	.	It	's	a	time	of	change	,	when	warmth	turns	to	cold	,	water	turns	to	snow	,	and	then	it	all	 disappear 	 s 	 	.
There	are	13	cards	in	each	suit	.
Voice	:	Each	card	 represent 	 s 	 	a	phase	of	the	13	lunar	cycles	.
MT	:	So	over	here	is	low	tide	,	and	over	here	is	high	tide	,	and	in	the	middle	is	the	moon	.
Voice	:	The	moon	is	one	of	the	most	potent	symbols	of	magic	.
MT	:	There	are	two	colors	in	a	deck	of	cards	.
There	is	the	color	red	and	the	color	black	,	 represent 	 ing 	 	the	constant	change	from	day	to	night	.
Voice	:	Marco	,	I	did	not	know	you	could	do	that	.
MT	:	And	is	it	a	 co 	 incidence 	 	that	there	are	52	cards	in	a	deck	of	cards	,	just	as	there	are	52	weeks	in	a	year	?
Voice	:	If	you	total	all	the	spots	on	a	deck	of	cards	,	the	result	is	365	.
MT	:	Oh	,	365	,	the	number	of	days	in	a	year	,	the	number	of	days	between	each	birthday	.
Make	a	wish	.
Voice	:	Do	n't	tell	,	or	it	wo	n't	come	true	.
MT	:	Well	,	as	a	matter	of	fact	,	it	was	on	my	sixth	birthday	that	I	received	my	first	deck	of	cards	,	and	ever	since	that	day	,	I	have	 travel 	 ed 	 	around	the	world	performing	magic	for	boys	and	girls	,	men	and	women	,	 husband 	 s 	 	and	wives	,	even	kings	and	queens	.
Voice	:	And	who	are	these	?	MT	:	Ah	,	 mischief 	 - 	 makers 	 	.	Watch	.
Wake	up	.
Joker	:	 Who 	 a 	 	.	MT	:	Are	you	ready	for	your	party	piece	?
Joker	:	Ready	!	MT	:	Let	me	see	what	you	've	got	.
Joker	:	 Present 	 ing 	 	my	pogo	stick	.	MT	:	Ah	.	Watch	out	.
Joker	:	 Who 	 a 	 	,	 who 	 a 	 	,	 who 	 a 	 	,	oh	!
MT	:	But	today	,	I	am	performing	for	a	different	kind	of	audience	.
I	'm	performing	for	you	.
Voice	:	Signed	card	detected	.	MT	:	Well	,	sometimes	people	ask	me	how	do	you	become	a	magician	?	Is	it	a	9-to-5	job	?
Of	course	not	!	You	've	got	to	practice	24/7	.
I	do	n't	literally	mean	24	hours	,	seven	days	a	week	.
24/7	is	a	little	bit	of	an	 exaggerat 	 ion 	 	,	but	it	does	take	practice	.	Now	,	some	people	will	say	,	well	,	magic	,	that	must	be	the	work	of	some	evil	supernatural	force	.
 Who 	 a 	 	.
Well	,	to	this	,	I	just	say	,	no	no	.
Actually	,	in	German	,	it	's	 ne 	 in 	 	 ne 	 in 	 	.
Magic	is	n't	that	intense	.	I	have	to	warn	you	,	though	,	if	you	ever	play	with	someone	who	deals	cards	like	this	,	do	n't	play	for	money	.
Voice	:	Why	not	?	That	's	a	very	good	hand	.
The	odds	of	getting	it	are	4,165	to	one	.
MT	:	Yeah	,	but	I	guess	my	hand	is	better	.	We	beat	the	odds	.
Voice	:	I	think	you	got	your	birthday	wish	.	MT	:	And	that	actually	leaves	me	with	the	last	,	and	most	important	card	of	all	:	the	one	with	this	very	significant	mark	on	it	.
And	unlike	anything	else	we	've	just	seen	,	virtual	or	not	.	Voice	:	Signed	card	detected	.
Digital	MT	:	This	is	without	a	question	the	real	thing	.
MT	:	Bye	bye	.
Thank	you	.
Thank	you	very	much	.

Martin	Jacques	:	Understanding	the	rise	of	China
The	world	is	changing	with	 re 	 ally 	 	 remarkabl 	 e 	 	speed	.
If	you	look	at	the	chart	at	the	top	here	,	you	'll	see	that	in	2025	,	these	Goldman	Sachs	 projection 	 s 	 	suggest	that	the	Chinese	economy	will	be	almost	the	same	size	as	the	American	economy	.
And	if	you	look	at	the	chart	for	2050	,	it	's	 project 	 ed 	 	that	the	Chinese	economy	will	be	twice	the	size	of	the	American	economy	,	and	the	Indian	economy	will	be	almost	the	same	size	as	the	American	economy	.
And	we	should	bear	in	mind	here	that	these	 projection 	 s 	 	were	drawn	up	before	the	Western	financial	crisis	.
A	couple	of	weeks	ago	,	I	was	looking	at	the	latest	projection	by	BNP	 Pari 	 bas 	 	for	when	China	will	have	a	larger	economy	than	the	United	States	.
Goldman	Sachs	 project 	 ed 	 	2027	.
The	 post 	 - 	 crisis 	 	projection	is	2020	.
That	's	just	a	decade	away	.
China	is	going	to	change	the	world	in	two	fundamental	 respect 	 s 	 	.
First	of	all	,	it	's	a	huge	developing	country	with	a	population	of	1.3	billion	people	,	which	has	been	growing	for	over	30	years	at	around	10	percent	a	year	.
And	within	a	decade	,	it	will	have	the	largest	economy	in	the	world	.
Never	before	in	the	modern	era	has	the	largest	economy	in	the	world	been	that	of	a	developing	country	,	rather	than	a	developed	country	.
 Second 	 ly 	 	,	for	the	first	time	in	the	modern	era	,	the	dominant	country	in	the	world	--	which	I	think	is	what	China	will	become	--	will	be	not	from	the	West	and	from	very	,	very	different	 civilization 	 al 	 	roots	.
Now	,	I	know	it	's	a	widespread	assumption	in	the	West	that	as	countries	 modern 	 ize 	 	,	they	also	 western 	 ize 	 	.
This	is	an	illusion	.
It	's	an	assumption	that	modernity	is	a	product	simply	of	competition	,	markets	and	technology	.
It	is	not	.	It	is	also	shaped	 e 	 qually 	 	by	history	and	culture	.
China	is	not	like	the	West	,	and	it	will	not	become	like	the	West	.
It	will	remain	in	very	fundamental	 respect 	 s 	 	very	different	.
Now	the	big	question	here	is	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	how	do	we	make	sense	of	China	?
How	do	we	try	to	understand	what	China	is	?
And	the	problem	we	have	in	the	West	at	the	moment	,	by	and	large	,	is	that	the	conventional	approach	is	that	we	understand	it	 re 	 ally 	 	in	Western	terms	,	 us 	 ing 	 	Western	ideas	.
We	ca	n't	.
Now	I	want	to	offer	you	three	building	blocks	for	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	what	China	is	like	,	just	as	a	beginning	.
The	first	is	this	:	that	China	is	not	 re 	 ally 	 	a	 nation 	 - 	 state 	 	.
Okay	,	it	's	called	itself	a	 nation 	 - 	 state 	 	for	the	last	hundred	years	,	but	everyone	who	knows	anything	about	China	knows	it	's	a	lot	older	than	this	.
This	was	what	China	looked	like	with	the	victory	of	the	Qin	Dynasty	in	221	 B 	 .C 	 	.	at	the	end	of	the	 war 	 ring 	 - 	 state 	 	period	--	the	birth	of	modern	China	.
And	you	can	see	it	against	the	boundaries	of	modern	China	.
Or	 immediate 	 ly 	 	afterward	,	the	Han	Dynasty	,	still	2,000	years	ago	.
And	you	can	see	already	it	 occupie 	 s 	 	most	of	what	we	now	know	as	Eastern	China	,	which	is	where	the	vast	majority	of	Chinese	lived	then	and	live	now	.
Now	what	is	 extraordinar 	 y 	 	about	this	is	,	what	gives	China	its	sense	of	being	China	,	what	gives	the	Chinese	the	sense	of	what	it	is	to	be	Chinese	,	comes	not	from	the	last	hundred	years	,	not	from	the	 nation 	 - 	 state 	 	period	,	which	is	what	happened	in	the	West	,	but	from	the	period	,	if	you	like	,	of	the	 civilization 	 - 	 state 	 	.
I	'm	thinking	here	,	for	example	,	of	customs	like	ancestral	worship	,	of	a	very	 d 	 istinctive 	 	notion	of	the	state	,	 like 	 wise 	 	,	a	very	 d 	 istinctive 	 	notion	of	the	family	,	social	relationships	like	 guan 	 xi 	 	,	Confucian	values	and	so	on	.
These	are	all	things	that	come	from	the	period	of	the	 civilization 	 - 	 state 	 	.
In	other	words	,	China	,	unlike	the	Western	states	and	most	countries	in	the	world	,	is	shaped	by	its	sense	of	civilization	,	its	existence	as	a	 civilization 	 - 	 state 	 	,	rather	than	as	a	 nation 	 - 	 state 	 	.
And	there	's	one	other	thing	to	add	to	this	,	and	that	is	this	:	Of	course	we	know	China	's	big	,	huge	,	 demographic 	 ally 	 	and	 geographical 	 ly 	 	,	with	a	population	of	1.3	billion	people	.
What	we	often	are	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	aware	of	is	the	fact	that	China	is	 extreme 	 ly 	 	diverse	and	very	 pluralist 	 ic 	 	,	and	in	many	ways	very	 de 	 centralized 	 	.
You	ca	n't	run	a	place	on	this	scale	simply	from	Beijing	,	even	though	we	think	this	to	be	the	case	.
It	's	never	been	the	case	.
So	this	is	China	,	a	 civilization 	 - 	 state 	 	,	rather	than	a	 nation 	 - 	 state 	 	.
And	what	does	it	mean	?
Well	,	I	think	it	has	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	profound	 implication 	 s 	 	.
I	'll	give	you	two	quick	ones	.
The	first	is	that	the	most	important	political	value	for	the	Chinese	is	unity	,	is	the	maintenance	of	Chinese	civilization	.
You	know	,	2,000	years	ago	,	Europe	:	breakdown	--	the	fragmentation	of	the	Holy	Roman	Empire	.
It	divided	,	and	it	's	remained	divided	ever	since	.
China	,	over	the	same	time	period	,	went	in	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	opposite	direction	,	very	 pain 	 fully 	 	holding	this	huge	civilization	,	 civilization 	 - 	 state 	 	,	together	.
The	second	is	maybe	more	prosaic	,	which	is	Hong	Kong	.
Do	you	remember	the	 hand 	 over 	 	of	Hong	Kong	by	Britain	to	China	in	1997	?
You	may	remember	what	the	Chinese	constitutional	proposition	was	.
One	country	,	two	systems	.
And	I	'll	lay	a	wager	that	 bare 	 ly 	 	 any 	 one 	 	in	the	West	believed	them	.
``	Window	dressing	.
When	China	 get 	 s 	 	its	hands	on	Hong	Kong	,	that	wo	n't	be	the	case	.	''
Thirteen	years	on	,	the	political	and	legal	system	in	Hong	Kong	is	as	different	now	as	it	was	in	1997	.
We	were	wrong	.	Why	were	we	wrong	?
We	were	wrong	because	we	thought	,	 natural 	 ly 	 	enough	,	in	 nation 	 - 	 state 	 	ways	.
Think	of	German	unification	,	1990	.
What	happened	?
Well	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	the	East	was	 swallow 	 ed 	 	by	the	West	.
One	nation	,	one	system	.
That	is	the	 nation 	 - 	 state 	 	 mental 	 ity 	 	.
But	you	ca	n't	run	a	country	like	China	,	a	 civilization 	 - 	 state 	 	,	on	the	basis	of	one	civilization	,	one	system	.
It	does	n't	work	.
So	actually	the	response	of	China	to	the	question	of	Hong	Kong	--	as	it	will	be	to	the	question	of	Taiwan	--	was	a	natural	response	:	one	civilization	,	many	systems	.
Let	me	offer	you	another	building	block	to	try	and	understand	China	--	maybe	not	sort	of	a	 comfortabl 	 e 	 	one	.
The	Chinese	have	a	very	,	very	different	conception	of	race	to	most	other	countries	.
Do	you	know	,	of	the	1.3	billion	Chinese	,	over	90	percent	of	them	think	they	belong	to	the	same	race	,	the	Han	?
Now	,	this	is	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	from	the	world	's	[	other	]	most	populous	countries	.
India	,	the	United	States	,	Indonesia	,	Brazil	--	all	of	them	are	multiracial	.
The	Chinese	do	n't	feel	like	that	.
China	is	only	multiracial	 re 	 ally 	 	at	the	 margin 	 s 	 	.
So	the	question	is	,	why	?
Well	the	reason	,	I	think	,	 essential 	 ly 	 	is	,	again	,	back	to	the	 civilization 	 - 	 state 	 	.
A	history	of	at	least	2,000	years	,	a	history	of	conquest	,	occupation	,	absorption	,	assimilation	and	so	on	,	led	to	the	process	by	which	,	over	time	,	this	notion	of	the	Han	 e 	 merged 	 	--	of	course	,	 nurtur 	 ed 	 	by	a	growing	and	very	powerful	sense	of	cultural	identity	.
Now	the	great	advantage	of	this	historical	experience	has	been	that	,	without	the	Han	,	China	could	never	have	held	together	.
The	Han	identity	has	been	the	cement	which	has	held	this	country	together	.
The	great	disadvantage	of	it	is	that	the	Han	have	a	very	weak	conception	of	cultural	difference	.
They	 re 	 ally 	 	believe	in	their	own	 superior 	 ity 	 	,	and	they	are	 dis 	 respectful 	 	of	those	who	are	not	.
Hence	their	attitude	,	for	example	,	to	the	 Uyghur 	 s 	 	and	to	the	 Tibetan 	 s 	 	.
Or	let	me	give	you	my	third	building	block	,	the	Chinese	state	.
Now	the	relationship	between	the	state	and	society	in	China	is	very	different	from	that	in	the	West	.
Now	we	in	the	West	 overwhelm 	 ingly 	 	seem	to	think	--	in	these	days	at	least	--	that	the	authority	and	legitimacy	of	the	state	is	a	function	of	democracy	.
The	problem	with	this	proposition	is	that	the	Chinese	state	 enjoy 	 s 	 	more	legitimacy	and	more	authority	 a 	 mongst 	 	the	Chinese	than	is	true	with	any	Western	state	.
And	the	reason	for	this	is	because	--	well	,	there	are	two	reasons	,	I	think	.
And	it	's	 obvious 	 ly 	 	got	nothing	to	do	with	democracy	,	because	in	our	terms	the	Chinese	 certain 	 ly 	 	do	n't	have	a	democracy	.
And	the	reason	for	this	is	,	 first 	 ly 	 	,	because	the	state	in	China	is	given	a	very	special	--	it	 enjoy 	 s 	 	a	very	special	significance	as	the	representative	,	the	embodiment	and	the	guardian	of	Chinese	civilization	,	of	the	 civilization 	 - 	 state 	 	.
This	is	as	close	as	China	 get 	 s 	 	to	a	kind	of	spiritual	role	.
And	the	second	reason	is	because	,	whereas	in	Europe	and	North	America	,	the	state	's	power	is	 continuous 	 ly 	 	 challenge 	 d 	 	--	I	mean	in	the	European	tradition	,	 historical 	 ly 	 	against	the	church	,	against	other	sectors	of	the	 arist 	 ocracy 	 	,	against	merchants	and	so	on	--	for	1,000	years	,	the	power	of	the	Chinese	state	has	not	been	 challenge 	 d 	 	.
It	's	had	no	serious	 rival 	 s 	 	.
So	you	can	see	that	the	way	in	which	power	has	been	constructed	in	China	is	very	different	from	our	experience	in	Western	history	.
The	result	,	by	the	way	,	is	that	the	Chinese	have	a	very	different	view	of	the	state	.
Whereas	we	tend	to	view	it	as	an	intruder	,	a	stranger	,	 certain 	 ly 	 	an	organ	whose	powers	need	to	be	limited	or	defined	and	constrained	,	the	Chinese	do	n't	see	the	state	like	that	at	all	.
The	Chinese	view	the	state	as	an	 in 	 timate 	 	--	not	just	as	an	 in 	 timate 	 	actually	,	as	a	member	of	the	family	--	not	just	in	fact	as	a	member	of	the	family	,	but	as	the	head	of	the	family	,	the	patriarch	of	the	family	.
This	is	the	Chinese	view	of	the	state	--	very	,	very	different	to	ours	.
It	's	embedded	in	society	in	a	different	kind	of	way	to	what	is	the	case	in	the	West	.
And	I	would	suggest	to	you	that	actually	what	we	are	dealing	with	here	,	in	the	Chinese	context	,	is	a	new	kind	of	paradigm	,	which	is	different	from	anything	we	've	had	to	think	about	in	the	past	.
Know	that	China	 believe 	 s 	 	in	the	market	and	the	state	.
I	mean	,	Adam	Smith	,	already	writing	in	the	late	18th	century	,	said	,	``	The	Chinese	market	is	larger	and	more	developed	and	more	 s 	 ophisticated 	 	than	anything	in	Europe	.	''
And	,	apart	from	the	Mao	period	,	that	has	remained	more	or	less	the	case	ever	since	.
But	this	is	combined	with	an	 extreme 	 ly 	 	strong	and	 ubiquit 	 ous 	 	state	.
The	state	is	everywhere	in	China	.
I	mean	,	it	's	leading	firms	--	many	of	them	are	still	 public 	 ly 	 	owned	.
Private	firms	,	however	large	they	are	,	like	Lenovo	,	depend	in	many	ways	on	state	patronage	.
 Target 	 s 	 	for	the	economy	and	so	on	are	set	by	the	state	.
And	the	state	,	of	course	,	its	authority	flows	into	lots	of	other	areas	--	as	we	are	familiar	with	--	with	something	like	the	 one 	 - 	 child 	 	policy	.
Moreover	,	this	is	a	very	old	state	tradition	,	a	very	old	tradition	of	 state 	 craft 	 	.
I	mean	,	if	you	want	an	illustration	of	this	,	the	Great	Wall	is	one	.
But	this	is	another	,	this	is	the	Grand	Canal	,	which	was	constructed	in	the	first	instance	in	the	fifth	century	 B 	 .C 	 	.
and	was	finally	completed	in	the	seventh	century	A.D	.
It	went	for	1,114	miles	,	linking	Beijing	with	Hangzhou	and	Shanghai	.
So	there	's	a	long	history	of	 extraordinar 	 y 	 	state	 infra 	 structural 	 	projects	in	China	,	which	I	suppose	 help 	 s 	 	us	to	explain	what	we	see	today	,	which	is	something	like	the	Three	 Gorge 	 s 	 	Dam	and	many	other	 expression 	 s 	 	of	state	competence	within	China	.
So	there	we	have	three	building	blocks	for	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	the	difference	that	is	China	--	the	 civilization 	 - 	 state 	 	,	the	notion	of	race	and	the	nature	of	the	state	and	its	relationship	to	society	.
And	yet	we	still	insist	,	by	and	large	,	in	thinking	that	we	can	understand	China	by	simply	drawing	on	Western	experience	,	looking	at	it	through	Western	eyes	,	 us 	 ing 	 	Western	concepts	.
If	you	want	to	know	why	we	 un 	 erring 	 ly 	 	seem	to	get	China	wrong	--	our	 prediction 	 s 	 	about	what	's	going	to	happen	to	China	are	incorrect	--	this	is	the	reason	.
Unfortunately	,	I	think	,	I	have	to	say	that	I	think	attitude	towards	China	is	that	of	a	kind	of	little	 Western 	 er 	 	 mental 	 ity 	 	.
It	's	kind	of	arrogant	.
It	's	arrogant	in	the	sense	that	we	think	that	we	are	best	,	and	therefore	we	have	the	universal	measure	.
And	 second 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	ignorant	.
We	refuse	to	 re 	 ally 	 	address	the	issue	of	difference	.
You	know	,	there	's	a	very	 interest 	 ing 	 	passage	in	a	book	by	Paul	Cohen	,	the	American	historian	.
And	Paul	Cohen	argues	that	the	West	 think 	 s 	 	of	itself	as	probably	the	most	cosmopolitan	of	all	cultures	.
But	it	's	not	.
In	many	ways	,	it	's	the	most	parochial	,	because	for	200	years	,	the	West	has	been	so	dominant	in	the	world	that	it	's	not	 re 	 ally 	 	needed	to	understand	other	cultures	,	other	 civilization 	 s 	 	.
Because	,	at	the	end	of	the	day	,	it	could	,	if	necessary	by	force	,	get	its	own	way	.
Whereas	those	cultures	--	 virtual 	 ly 	 	the	rest	of	the	world	,	in	fact	,	which	have	been	in	a	far	 weak 	 er 	 	position	,	 vis 	 - 	 a 	 - 	 vis 	 	the	West	--	have	been	 there 	 by 	 	forced	to	understand	the	West	,	because	of	the	West	's	presence	in	those	societies	.
And	therefore	,	they	are	,	as	a	result	,	more	cosmopolitan	in	many	ways	than	the	West	.
I	mean	,	take	the	question	of	East	Asia	.
East	Asia	:	Japan	,	Korea	,	China	,	etc	.	--	a	third	of	the	world	's	population	lives	there	.
Now	the	largest	economic	region	in	the	world	.
And	I	'll	tell	you	now	,	that	East	 Asian 	 ers 	 	,	people	from	East	Asia	,	are	far	more	 knowledge 	 able 	 	about	the	West	than	the	West	is	about	East	Asia	.
Now	this	point	is	very	germane	,	I	'm	afraid	,	to	the	present	.
Because	what	's	happening	?	Back	to	that	chart	at	the	beginning	,	the	Goldman	Sachs	chart	.
What	is	happening	is	that	,	very	rapidly	in	historical	terms	,	the	world	is	being	driven	and	shaped	,	not	by	the	old	developed	countries	,	but	by	the	developing	world	.
We	've	seen	this	in	terms	of	the	 G 	 20 	 	 usurp 	 ing 	 	very	rapidly	the	position	of	the	G7	,	or	the	G8	.
And	there	are	two	 consequence 	 s 	 	of	this	.
First	,	the	West	is	rapidly	losing	its	influence	in	the	world	.
There	was	a	dramatic	illustration	of	this	actually	a	year	ago	--	Copenhagen	,	climate	change	conference	.
Europe	was	not	at	the	final	 negotiat 	 ing 	 	table	.
When	did	that	last	happen	?
I	would	wager	it	was	probably	about	200	years	ago	.
And	that	is	what	is	going	to	happen	in	the	future	.
And	the	second	implication	is	that	the	world	will	 inevit 	 ably 	 	,	as	a	consequence	,	become	 i 	 ncreasingly 	 	 un 	 familiar 	 	to	us	,	because	it	'll	be	shaped	by	cultures	and	 experience 	 s 	 	and	 historie 	 s 	 	that	we	are	not	 re 	 ally 	 	familiar	with	,	or	 conversa 	 nt 	 	with	.
And	at	last	,	I	'm	afraid	--	take	Europe	;	America	is	 s 	 lightly 	 	different	--	but	 European 	 s 	 	by	and	large	,	I	have	to	say	,	are	ignorant	,	are	 una 	 ware 	 	about	the	way	the	world	is	changing	.
Some	people	--	I	've	got	an	English	friend	in	China	,	and	he	said	,	``	The	continent	is	 sleepwalk 	 ing 	 	into	oblivion	.	''
Well	,	maybe	that	's	true	,	maybe	that	's	an	 exaggerat 	 ion 	 	.
But	there	's	another	problem	which	goes	along	with	this	--	that	Europe	is	 i 	 ncreasingly 	 	out	of	touch	with	the	world	--	and	that	is	a	sort	of	loss	of	a	sense	of	the	future	.
I	mean	,	Europe	once	,	of	course	,	once	 command 	 ed 	 	the	future	in	its	confidence	.
Take	the	19th	century	,	for	example	.
But	this	,	alas	,	is	no	 long 	 er 	 	true	.
If	you	want	to	feel	the	future	,	if	you	want	to	taste	the	future	,	try	China	--	there	's	old	Confucius	.
This	is	a	railway	station	the	 like 	 s 	 	of	which	you	've	never	seen	before	.
It	does	n't	even	look	like	a	railway	station	.
This	is	the	new	Guangzhou	railway	station	for	the	 high 	 - 	 speed 	 	trains	.
China	already	has	a	 bigg 	 er 	 	network	than	any	other	country	in	the	world	and	will	soon	have	more	than	all	the	rest	of	the	world	put	together	.
Or	take	this	:	now	this	is	an	idea	,	but	it	's	an	idea	to	be	tried	out	 short 	 ly 	 	in	a	suburb	of	Beijing	.
Here	you	have	a	 mega 	 bus 	 	,	on	the	upper	deck	carries	about	2,000	people	.
It	 travel 	 s 	 	on	rails	down	a	suburban	road	,	and	the	cars	travel	 u 	 nderneath 	 	it	.
And	it	does	speeds	of	up	to	about	100	miles	an	hour	.
Now	this	is	the	way	things	are	going	to	move	,	because	China	has	a	very	specific	problem	,	which	is	different	from	Europe	and	different	from	the	United	States	:	China	has	huge	numbers	of	people	and	no	space	.
So	this	is	a	solution	to	a	situation	where	China	's	going	to	have	many	,	many	,	many	cities	over	20	million	people	.
Okay	,	so	how	would	I	like	to	finish	?
Well	,	what	should	our	attitude	be	towards	this	world	that	we	see	very	rapidly	developing	before	us	?
I	think	there	will	be	good	things	about	it	and	there	will	be	bad	things	about	it	.
But	I	want	to	argue	,	above	all	,	a	 big 	 - 	 picture 	 	positive	for	this	world	.
For	200	years	,	the	world	was	 essential 	 ly 	 	 govern 	 ed 	 	by	a	fragment	of	the	human	population	.
That	's	what	Europe	and	North	America	represented	.
The	arrival	of	countries	like	China	and	India	--	between	them	38	percent	of	the	world	's	population	--	and	others	like	Indonesia	and	Brazil	and	so	on	,	represent	the	most	important	single	act	of	 democrat 	 ization 	 	in	the	last	200	years	.
Civilizations	and	cultures	,	which	had	been	 ignor 	 ed 	 	,	which	had	no	voice	,	which	were	not	 listen 	 ed 	 	to	,	which	were	not	known	about	,	will	have	a	different	sort	of	representation	in	this	world	.
As	 humanist 	 s 	 	,	we	must	welcome	,	 sure 	 ly 	 	,	this	transformation	,	and	we	will	have	to	learn	about	these	 civilization 	 s 	 	.
This	big	ship	here	was	the	one	 sail 	 ed 	 	in	by	Zheng	He	in	the	early	15th	century	on	his	great	 voyage 	 s 	 	around	the	South	China	Sea	,	the	East	China	Sea	and	across	the	Indian	Ocean	to	East	Africa	.
The	little	boat	in	front	of	it	was	the	one	in	which	,	80	years	later	,	Christopher	Columbus	 cross 	 ed 	 	the	Atlantic	.
Or	,	look	 care 	 fully 	 	at	this	silk	scroll	made	by	 Zhu 	 Zhou 	 	in	1368	.
I	think	they	're	playing	golf	.
Christ	,	the	Chinese	even	 invent 	 ed 	 	golf	.
Welcome	to	the	future	.	Thank	you	.

Ian	 Gold 	 in 	 	:	 Naviga 	 ting 	 	our	global	future
The	future	,	as	we	know	it	,	is	very	 un 	 predict 	 able 	 	.
The	best	minds	in	the	best	institutions	generally	get	it	wrong	.
This	is	in	technology	.	This	is	in	the	area	of	politics	,	where	 pundit 	 s 	 	,	the	CIA	,	 MI 	 6 	 	always	get	it	wrong	.
And	it	's	 clear 	 ly 	 	in	the	area	of	finance	.
With	institutions	established	to	think	about	the	future	,	the	IMF	,	the	BIS	,	the	Financial	Stability	Forum	,	could	n't	see	what	was	coming	.
Over	20,000	 economist 	 s 	 	whose	job	it	is	,	competitive	entry	to	get	there	,	could	n't	see	what	was	happening	.
 Global 	 ization 	 	is	getting	more	complex	.
And	this	change	is	getting	more	rapid	.
The	future	will	be	more	 un 	 predict 	 able 	 	.
coming	together	,	leads	to	a	new	renaissance	.
It	did	this	a	thousand	years	ago	.
The	last	40	years	have	been	 extraordinar 	 y 	 	times	.
Life	expectancy	has	gone	up	by	about	25	years	.
It	took	from	the	Stone	Age	to	achieve	that	.
Income	has	gone	up	for	a	majority	of	the	world	's	population	,	 despit 	 e 	 	the	population	going	up	by	about	two	billion	people	over	this	period	.
And	 il 	 literacy 	 	has	gone	down	,	from	a	half	to	about	a	quarter	of	the	people	on	Earth	.
A	huge	opportunity	,	 unleash 	 ing 	 	of	new	potential	for	innovation	,	for	development	.
But	there	is	an	 under 	 belly 	 	.
There	are	two	Achilles	'	heels	of	globalization	.
There	is	the	Achilles	'	heel	of	growing	inequality	--	those	that	are	left	out	,	those	that	feel	angry	,	those	that	are	not	 participat 	 ing 	 	.	 Global 	 ization 	 	has	not	been	inclusive	.
The	second	Achilles	'	heel	is	complexity	--	a	growing	 fragil 	 ity 	 	,	a	growing	 brittle 	 ness 	 	.
What	 happen 	 s 	 	in	one	place	very	quickly	 affect 	 s 	 	everything	else	.
This	is	a	systemic	risk	,	systemic	shock	.
We	've	seen	it	in	the	financial	crisis	.	We	've	seen	it	in	the	pandemic	flu	.
It	will	become	virulent	and	it	's	something	we	have	to	build	 re 	 silience 	 	against	.
A	lot	of	this	is	driven	by	what	's	happening	in	technology	.
There	have	been	huge	 leap 	 s 	 	.	There	will	be	a	 million 	 - 	 fold 	 	improvement	in	what	you	can	get	for	the	same	price	in	computing	by	2030	.
That	's	what	the	experience	of	the	last	20	years	has	been	.
It	will	continue	.
Our	computers	,	our	systems	will	be	as	primitive	as	the	Apollo	's	are	for	today	.
Our	mobile	phones	are	more	powerful	than	the	total	Apollo	space	engine	.
Our	mobile	phones	are	more	powerful	than	some	of	the	 strong 	 est 	 	computers	of	20	years	ago	.
So	what	will	this	do	?
It	will	create	huge	opportunities	in	technology	.
 Miniatur 	 ization 	 	as	well	.
There	will	be	invisible	capacity	.	Invisible	capacity	in	our	bodies	,	in	our	brains	,	and	in	the	air	.
This	is	a	dust	mite	on	a	 nano 	 replica 	 	.
This	sort	of	ability	to	do	everything	in	new	ways	 unleash 	 es 	 	potential	,	not	least	in	the	area	of	medicine	.
This	is	a	stem	cell	that	we	've	developed	here	in	Oxford	,	from	an	embryonic	stem	cell	.
We	can	develop	any	part	of	the	body	.
 Increasing 	 ly 	 	,	over	time	,	this	will	be	possible	from	our	own	skin	--	able	to	 replicat 	 e 	 	parts	of	the	body	.
Fantastic	potential	for	regenerative	medicine	.
I	do	n't	think	there	will	be	a	Special	Olympics	long	after	2030	,	because	of	this	capacity	to	 re 	 generate 	 	parts	of	the	body	.
But	the	question	is	,	``	Who	will	have	it	?	''
The	other	major	development	is	going	to	be	in	the	area	of	what	can	happen	in	genetics	.
The	capacity	to	create	,	as	this	mouse	has	been	genetically	modified	,	something	which	goes	three	times	faster	,	 last 	 s 	 	for	three	times	 long 	 er 	 	,	we	could	produce	,	as	this	mouse	can	,	to	the	age	of	our	equivalent	of	80	years	,	 us 	 ing 	 	about	the	same	amount	of	food	.
But	will	this	only	be	available	for	the	super	rich	,	for	those	that	can	afford	it	?	Are	we	headed	for	a	new	 eugenic 	 s 	 	?
Will	only	those	that	are	able	to	afford	it	be	able	to	be	this	super	race	of	the	future	?
So	the	big	question	for	us	is	,	``	How	do	we	manage	this	technological	change	?	''
How	do	we	ensure	that	it	 create 	 s 	 	a	more	inclusive	technology	,	a	technology	which	means	that	not	only	as	we	grow	older	,	that	we	can	also	grow	wiser	,	and	that	we	're	able	to	support	the	 population 	 s 	 	of	the	future	?
One	of	the	most	dramatic	 manifest 	 ations 	 	of	these	 improvement 	 s 	 	will	be	moving	from	population	 pyramid 	 s 	 	to	what	we	might	term	population	 coffin 	 s 	 	.
There	is	unlikely	to	be	a	pension	or	a	retirement	age	in	2030	.
These	will	be	redundant	concepts	.	And	this	is	n't	only	something	of	the	West	.
The	most	dramatic	changes	will	be	the	skyscraper	type	of	new	 pyramid 	 s 	 	that	will	take	place	in	China	and	in	many	other	countries	.
So	forget	about	 retirement 	 s 	 	if	you	're	young	.
Forget	about	 pension 	 s 	 	.	Think	about	life	and	where	it	's	going	to	be	going	.
Of	course	,	migration	will	become	even	more	important	.
The	war	on	talent	,	the	need	to	attract	people	at	all	skill	ranges	,	to	push	us	around	in	our	 wheel 	 chairs 	 	,	but	also	to	drive	our	 economie 	 s 	 	.	Our	innovation	will	be	vital	.
The	employment	in	the	rich	countries	will	go	down	from	about	800	to	about	700	million	of	these	people	.
This	would	imply	a	massive	leap	in	migration	.
So	the	concerns	,	the	 xeno 	 phobic 	 	concerns	of	today	,	of	migration	,	will	be	turned	on	their	head	,	as	we	search	for	people	to	help	us	sort	out	our	 pension 	 s 	 	and	our	 economie 	 s 	 	in	the	future	.
And	then	,	the	systemic	risks	.
We	understand	that	these	will	become	much	more	virulent	,	that	what	we	see	today	is	this	 inter 	 weaving 	 	of	societies	,	of	systems	,	 fasten 	 ed 	 	by	technologies	and	 hasten 	 ed 	 	by	 just 	 - 	 in 	 - 	 time 	 	management	systems	.
Small	levels	of	stock	push	 re 	 silience 	 	into	other	people	's	responsibility	.
The	collapse	in	biodiversity	,	climate	change	,	 pandemic 	 s 	 	,	financial	crises	:	these	will	be	the	currency	that	we	will	think	about	.
And	so	a	new	awareness	will	have	to	 aris 	 e 	 	,	of	how	we	deal	with	these	,	how	we	mobilize	 our 	 selves 	 	,	in	a	new	way	,	and	come	together	as	a	community	to	manage	systemic	risk	.
It	's	going	to	require	innovation	.
It	's	going	to	require	an	understanding	that	the	glory	of	globalization	could	also	be	its	 down 	 fall 	 	.
This	could	be	our	best	century	ever	because	of	the	 achievement 	 s 	 	,	or	it	could	be	our	worst	.
And	of	course	we	need	to	worry	about	the	 individual 	 s 	 	,	 particular 	 ly 	 	the	 individual 	 s 	 	that	feel	that	they	've	been	left	out	in	one	way	or	another	.
An	individual	,	for	the	first	time	in	the	history	of	humanity	,	will	have	the	capacity	,	by	2030	,	to	destroy	the	planet	,	to	wreck	everything	,	through	the	creation	,	for	example	,	of	a	 bio 	 pathogen 	 	.
How	do	we	begin	to	weave	these	 tapes 	 tries 	 	together	?
How	do	we	think	about	complex	systems	in	new	ways	?
That	will	be	the	challenge	of	the	scholars	,	and	of	all	of	us	engaged	in	thinking	about	the	future	.
The	rest	of	our	lives	will	be	in	the	future	.	We	need	to	prepare	for	it	now	.
We	need	to	understand	that	the	governance	structure	in	the	world	is	 fossil 	 ized 	 	.
It	can	not	begin	to	cope	with	the	challenges	that	this	will	bring	.
We	have	to	develop	a	new	way	of	 man 	 aging 	 	the	planet	,	 collective 	 ly 	 	,	through	collective	wisdom	.
We	know	,	and	I	know	from	my	own	experience	,	that	amazing	things	can	happen	,	when	 individual 	 s 	 	and	societies	come	together	to	change	their	future	.
I	left	South	Africa	,	and	15	years	later	,	after	thinking	I	would	never	go	back	,	I	had	the	privilege	and	the	honor	to	work	in	the	government	of	Nelson	Mandela	.
This	was	a	miracle	.	We	can	create	 miracle 	 s 	 	,	 collective 	 ly 	 	,	in	our	lifetime	.
It	is	vital	that	we	do	so	.
It	is	vital	that	the	ideas	that	are	 nurtur 	 ed 	 	in	TED	,	that	the	ideas	that	we	think	about	look	forward	,	and	make	sure	that	this	will	be	the	most	glorious	century	,	and	not	one	of	 eco 	 - 	 disaster 	 	and	 eco 	 - 	 collapse 	 	.
Thank	you	.

Raghava	KK	:	Five	lives	of	an	artist
I	think	it	was	in	my	second	grade	that	I	was	caught	drawing	the	bust	of	a	nude	by	Michelangelo	.
I	was	sent	straight	away	to	my	school	principal	,	and	my	school	principal	,	a	sweet	nun	,	looked	at	my	book	with	disgust	,	flipped	through	the	pages	,	saw	all	the	nudes	--	you	know	,	I	'd	been	seeing	my	mother	draw	nudes	and	I	'd	copy	her	--	and	the	nun	 s 	 lapped 	 	me	on	my	face	and	said	,	``	Sweet	Jesus	,	this	kid	has	already	begun	.	''
I	had	no	clue	what	she	was	talking	about	,	but	it	was	convincing	enough	for	me	never	to	draw	again	until	the	ninth	grade	.
Thanks	to	a	 re 	 ally 	 	boring	lecture	,	I	started	 caricatu 	 ring 	 	my	teachers	in	school	.
And	,	you	know	,	I	got	a	lot	of	popularity	.
I	do	n't	play	sports	.	I	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	at	sports	.
I	do	n't	have	the	 fanci 	 est 	 	 gadget 	 s 	 	at	home	.
I	'm	not	on	top	of	the	class	.
So	for	me	,	 cartoon 	 ing 	 	gave	me	a	sense	of	identity	.
I	got	popular	,	but	I	was	scared	I	'd	get	caught	again	.
So	what	I	did	was	I	quickly	put	together	a	collage	of	all	the	teachers	I	had	drawn	,	glorified	my	school	principal	,	put	him	right	on	top	,	and	gifted	it	to	him	.
He	had	a	good	laugh	at	the	other	teachers	and	put	it	up	on	the	notice	board	.
This	is	a	part	of	that	.
And	I	became	a	school	hero	.
All	my	 senior 	 s 	 	knew	me	.	I	felt	 re 	 ally 	 	special	.
I	have	to	tell	you	a	little	bit	about	my	family	.
That	's	my	mother	.	I	love	her	to	bits	.
She	's	the	one	who	taught	me	how	to	draw	and	,	more	 important 	 ly 	 	,	how	to	love	.
She	's	a	bit	of	a	hippie	.
She	said	,	``	Do	n't	say	that	,	''	but	I	'm	saying	it	 any 	 way 	 	.
The	rest	of	my	family	are	boring	 academic 	 s 	 	,	busy	 collect 	 ing 	 	Ivy	League	 decal 	 s 	 	for	our	classic	Ambassador	car	.
My	father	's	a	little	different	.
My	father	believed	in	a	 hol 	 istic 	 	approach	to	living	,	and	,	you	know	,	every	time	he	taught	us	,	he	'd	say	,	``	I	hate	these	books	,	because	these	books	are	 hijack 	 ed 	 	by	Industrial	Revolution	.	''
While	he	still	held	that	 world 	 view 	 	,	I	was	16	,	I	got	the	best	lawyer	in	town	,	my	older	brother	Karthik	,	and	I	sat	him	down	,	and	I	said	,	``	Pa	,	from	today	onwards	I	've	decided	I	'm	going	to	be	 discipline 	 d 	 	,	I	'm	going	to	be	curious	,	I	'm	going	to	learn	something	new	every	day	,	I	'm	going	to	be	very	hard	working	,	and	I	'm	not	going	to	depend	on	you	 emotional 	 ly 	 	or	 financial 	 ly 	 	.	''
And	he	was	very	 impress 	 ed 	 	.	He	was	all	 tear 	 ing 	 	up	.	Ready	to	hug	me	.
And	I	said	,	``	Hold	that	thought	.	''
I	said	,	``	Can	I	quit	school	then	?	''
But	,	to	cut	a	long	story	short	,	I	quit	school	to	pursue	a	career	as	a	cartoonist	.
I	must	have	done	about	30,000	 caricature 	 s 	 	.
I	would	do	birthday	parties	,	 wedding 	 s 	 	,	 divorce 	 s 	 	,	anything	for	 any 	 one 	 	who	wanted	to	use	my	services	.
But	,	most	 important 	 ly 	 	,	while	I	was	 travel 	 ing 	 	,	I	taught	children	 cartoon 	 ing 	 	,	and	in	exchange	,	I	learned	how	to	be	spontaneous	.
And	mad	and	crazy	and	fun	.
When	I	started	teaching	them	,	I	said	let	me	start	 do 	 ing 	 	this	 professional 	 ly 	 	.
When	I	was	18	I	started	my	own	school	.
However	,	an	18	 year 	 - 	 old 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	start	a	school	is	not	easy	 un 	 less 	 	you	have	a	big	patron	or	a	big	supporter	.
So	I	was	flipping	through	the	pages	of	the	Times	of	India	when	I	saw	that	the	Prime	Minister	of	India	was	 visit 	 ing 	 	my	home	town	,	Bangalore	.
And	,	you	know	,	just	like	how	every	cartoonist	knows	Bush	here	,	and	if	you	had	to	meet	Bush	,	it	would	be	the	 fun 	 nest 	 	thing	because	his	face	was	a	cartoonist	's	delight	.
I	had	to	meet	my	Prime	Minister	.
I	went	to	the	place	where	his	helicopter	was	about	to	land	.
I	saw	layers	of	security	.
I	 caricature 	 d 	 	my	way	through	three	layers	by	just	 impress 	 ing 	 	the	guards	,	but	I	got	stuck	.	I	got	stuck	at	the	third	.
And	what	happened	was	,	to	my	luck	,	I	saw	a	nuclear	scientist	at	whose	party	I	had	done	cartoons	.
I	ran	up	to	him	,	and	said	,	``	Hello	,	sir	.	How	do	you	do	?	''
He	said	,	``	What	are	you	 do 	 ing 	 	here	,	Raghava	?	''
I	said	,	``	I	'm	here	to	meet	the	Prime	Minister	.	''
He	said	,	``	Oh	,	so	am	I	.	''
I	hopped	into	his	car	,	and	off	we	went	through	the	remaining	layers	of	security	.
Thank	you	.
I	sat	him	down	,	I	 caricature 	 d 	 	him	,	and	since	then	I	've	 caricature 	 d 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	celebrities	.
This	is	one	I	remember	 fond 	 ly 	 	.
Salman	 Rush 	 die 	 	was	 piss 	 ed 	 - 	 off 	 	I	think	because	I	altered	the	map	of	New	York	,	if	you	notice	.
Anyway	,	the	next	slide	I	'm	about	to	show	you	--	Should	I	just	turn	that	off	?
The	next	slide	I	'm	about	to	show	you	,	is	a	little	more	serious	.
I	was	hesitant	to	include	this	in	my	presentation	because	this	cartoon	was	published	soon	after	9/11	.
What	was	,	for	me	,	a	very	naive	observation	,	turned	out	to	be	a	disaster	.
That	evening	,	I	came	home	to	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	hate	 mail 	 s 	 	,	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	people	telling	me	how	they	could	have	lived	another	day	without	seeing	this	.
I	was	also	asked	to	leave	the	organization	,	a	 cartoonist 	 s 	 	'	organization	in	America	,	that	for	me	was	my	 life 	 line 	 	.
That	's	when	I	 re 	 alized 	 	,	you	know	,	cartoons	are	 re 	 ally 	 	powerful	,	art	comes	with	responsibility	.
Anyway	,	what	I	did	was	I	decided	that	I	need	to	take	a	break	.
I	quit	my	job	at	the	papers	,	I	closed	my	school	,	and	I	wrapped	up	my	 pencil 	 s 	 	and	my	brushes	and	inks	,	and	I	decided	to	go	 travel 	 ing 	 	.
When	I	went	 travel 	 ing 	 	,	I	remember	,	I	met	this	fabulous	old	man	,	who	I	met	when	I	was	 caricatu 	 ring 	 	,	who	turned	out	to	be	an	artist	,	in	Italy	.
He	invited	me	to	his	studio	.	He	said	,	``	Come	and	visit	.	''
When	I	went	,	I	saw	the	 ghast 	 liest 	 	thing	ever	.
I	saw	this	dead	,	naked	 effi 	 gy 	 	of	himself	hanging	from	the	ceiling	.
I	said	,	``	Oh	,	my	God	.	What	is	that	?	''
And	I	asked	him	,	and	he	said	,	``	Oh	,	that	thing	?	In	the	night	,	I	die	.
In	the	morning	,	I	am	born	again	.	''
I	thought	he	was	koo	koo	,	but	something	about	that	 re 	 ally 	 	stuck	.
I	loved	it	.	I	thought	there	was	something	 re 	 ally 	 	beautiful	about	that	.
So	I	said	,	``	I	am	dead	,	so	I	need	to	be	born	again	.	''
So	,	I	wanted	to	be	a	painter	like	him	,	except	,	I	do	n't	know	how	to	paint	.
So	,	I	tried	going	to	the	art	store	.
You	know	,	there	are	a	hundred	types	of	brushes	.
Forget	it	,	they	will	 confus 	 e 	 	you	even	if	you	know	how	to	draw	.
So	I	decided	,	I	'm	going	to	learn	to	paint	by	myself	.
I	'm	going	to	show	you	a	very	quick	clip	to	show	you	how	I	painted	and	a	little	bit	about	my	city	,	Bangalore	.
They	had	to	be	larger	than	life	.
Everything	had	to	be	larger	.	The	next	painting	was	even	 bigg 	 er 	 	.
And	even	 bigg 	 er 	 	.
And	for	me	it	was	,	I	had	to	dance	while	I	painted	.
It	was	so	 excit 	 ing 	 	.
Except	,	I	even	started	painting	dancers	.
Here	for	example	is	a	Flamenco	dancer	,	except	there	was	one	problem	.
I	did	n't	know	the	dance	form	,	so	I	started	following	them	,	and	I	made	some	money	,	sold	my	paintings	and	would	rush	off	to	France	or	Spain	and	work	with	them	.
That	's	Pepe	 Linare 	 s 	 	,	the	 renown 	 ed 	 	Flamenco	singer	.
But	I	had	one	problem	,	my	paintings	never	 dance 	 d 	 	.
As	much	energy	as	I	put	into	them	while	making	them	,	they	never	 dance 	 d 	 	.
So	I	decided	--	I	had	this	crazy	 epi 	 phany 	 	at	two	in	the	morning	.
I	called	my	friends	,	painted	on	their	bodies	,	and	had	them	dance	in	front	of	a	painting	.
And	,	all	of	a	sudden	,	my	paintings	came	alive	.
And	then	I	was	fortunate	enough	to	actually	perform	this	in	California	with	Velocity	Circus	.
And	I	sat	like	you	guys	there	in	the	audience	.
And	I	saw	my	work	come	alive	.
You	know	,	 normal 	 ly 	 	you	work	in	isolation	,	and	you	show	at	a	gallery	,	but	here	,	the	work	was	coming	alive	,	and	it	had	some	other	artists	working	with	me	.
The	collaborative	effort	was	fabulous	.
I	said	,	I	'm	going	to	collaborate	with	 any 	 body 	 	and	everybody	I	meet	.
I	started	 do 	 ing 	 	fashion	.
This	is	a	fashion	show	we	held	in	London	.
The	best	collaboration	,	of	course	,	is	with	children	.
They	are	 ruth 	 less 	 	,	they	are	honest	,	but	they	're	full	of	energy	and	fun	.
This	is	a	work	,	a	library	I	designed	for	the	Robin	Hood	Foundation	.
And	I	must	say	,	I	spent	time	in	the	Bronx	working	with	these	kids	.
And	,	in	exchange	for	me	working	with	them	,	they	taught	me	how	to	be	cool	.
I	do	n't	think	I	've	succeeded	,	but	they	've	taught	me	.
They	said	,	``	Stop	saying	sorry	.	Say	,	my	bad	.	''
Then	I	said	,	all	this	is	good	,	but	I	want	to	paint	like	a	real	painter	.
American	education	is	so	expensive	.
I	was	in	India	,	and	I	was	walking	down	the	streets	,	and	I	saw	a	billboard	painter	.
And	these	guys	paint	 hu 	 mongous 	 	paintings	,	and	they	look	 re 	 ally 	 	good	.
And	I	 wonder 	 ed 	 	how	they	did	it	from	so	close	.
So	,	one	day	I	had	the	opportunity	to	meet	one	of	these	guys	,	and	I	said	,	``	How	do	you	paint	like	that	?	Who	taught	you	?	''
And	he	said	,	``	Oh	,	it	's	very	easy	.	I	can	teach	you	,	but	we	're	leaving	the	city	,	because	billboard	 painter 	 s 	 	are	a	dying	,	extinct	bunch	of	artists	,	because	digital	printing	has	totally	replaced	them	and	 hijack 	 ed 	 	them	.	''
I	said	,	in	exchange	for	education	in	how	to	paint	,	I	will	support	them	,	and	I	started	a	company	.
And	since	then	,	I	've	been	painting	all	over	the	place	.
This	is	a	painting	I	did	of	my	wife	in	my	apartment	.
This	is	another	painting	.
And	,	in	fact	,	I	started	painting	on	anything	,	and	started	 s 	 ending 	 	them	around	town	.
Since	I	mentioned	my	wife	,	the	most	important	collaboration	has	been	with	her	,	Netra	.
Netra	and	I	met	when	she	was	18	.
I	must	have	been	19	and	a	half	then	,	and	it	was	love	at	first	sight	.
I	lived	in	India	.	She	lived	in	America	.
She	'd	come	every	two	months	to	visit	me	,	and	then	I	said	I	'm	the	man	,	I	'm	the	man	,	and	I	have	to	 reciproca 	 te 	 	.
I	have	to	travel	seven	 ocean 	 s 	 	,	and	I	have	to	come	and	see	you	.
I	did	that	twice	,	and	I	went	broke	.
So	then	I	said	,	``	 Net 	 s 	 	,	what	do	I	do	?	''
She	said	,	``	Why	do	n't	you	send	me	your	paintings	?
My	dad	knows	a	bunch	of	rich	guys	.
We	'll	try	and	con	them	into	buying	it	,	and	then	...	''
But	it	turned	out	,	after	I	sent	the	works	to	her	,	that	her	dad	's	friends	,	like	most	of	you	,	are	 geek 	 s 	 	.
I	'm	 jok 	 ing 	 	.
No	,	they	were	 re 	 ally 	 	big	 geek 	 s 	 	,	and	they	did	n't	know	much	about	art	.
So	Netra	was	stuck	with	30	paintings	of	mine	.
So	what	we	did	was	we	 rent 	 ed 	 	a	little	van	and	we	drove	all	over	the	east	coast	 try 	 ing 	 	to	sell	it	.
She	 contact 	 ed 	 	 any 	 one 	 	and	everyone	who	was	willing	to	buy	my	work	.
She	made	enough	money	,	she	sold	off	the	whole	collection	and	made	enough	money	to	move	me	for	four	years	with	lawyers	,	a	company	,	everything	,	and	she	became	my	manager	.
That	's	us	in	New	York	.
Notice	one	thing	,	we	're	equal	here	.
Something	happened	along	the	line	.
But	this	brought	me	--	with	Netra	 man 	 aging 	 	my	career	--	it	brought	me	a	lot	of	success	.
I	was	 re 	 ally 	 	happy	.	I	thought	of	myself	as	a	bit	of	a	 rock 	 star 	 	.
I	loved	the	attention	.
This	is	all	the	press	we	got	,	and	we	said	,	it	's	time	to	 celebrat 	 e 	 	.
And	I	said	that	the	best	way	to	 celebrat 	 e 	 	is	to	marry	Netra	.
I	said	,	``	Let	's	get	married	.	''
And	I	said	,	``	Not	just	married	.	Let	's	invite	everyone	who	's	 help 	 ed 	 	us	,	all	the	people	who	bought	our	work	.	''
And	you	wo	n't	believe	it	,	we	put	together	a	list	of	7,000	people	,	who	had	made	a	difference	--	a	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	list	,	but	I	was	determined	to	bring	them	to	India	,	so	--	a	lot	of	them	were	in	India	.
150	artists	 volunteer 	 ed 	 	to	help	me	with	my	wedding	.
We	had	fashion	 designer 	 s 	 	,	installation	artists	,	models	,	we	had	makeup	artists	,	jewelry	 designer 	 s 	 	,	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	people	working	with	me	to	make	my	wedding	an	art	installation	.
And	I	had	a	special	installation	in	tribute	to	my	 in 	 - 	 laws 	 	.
I	had	the	vegetable	 carver 	 s 	 	work	on	that	for	me	.
But	all	this	 excite 	 ment 	 	led	to	the	press	writing	about	us	.
We	were	in	the	papers	,	we	're	still	in	the	news	three	years	later	,	but	,	 unfortunat 	 ely 	 	,	something	tragic	happened	right	after	.
My	mother	fell	very	ill	.
I	love	my	mother	and	I	was	told	all	of	a	sudden	that	she	was	going	to	die	.
And	they	said	you	have	to	say	bye	to	her	,	you	have	to	do	what	you	have	to	do	.
And	I	was	 deva 	 stated 	 	.
I	had	shows	 book 	 ed 	 	up	for	another	year	.
I	was	on	a	high	.
And	I	could	n't	.	I	could	not	.
My	life	was	not	exuberant	.
I	could	not	live	this	larger	than	life	person	.
I	started	 explor 	 ing 	 	the	 dark 	 er 	 	 abscess 	 es 	 	of	the	human	mind	.
Of	course	,	my	work	turned	ugly	,	but	another	thing	happened	.
I	lost	all	my	audiences	.
The	Bollywood	stars	who	I	would	party	with	and	buy	my	work	 disappear 	 ed 	 	.
The	 collector 	 s 	 	,	the	friends	,	the	press	,	everyone	said	,	``	Nice	,	but	thank	you	.	''
``	No	thank	you	,	''	was	more	like	it	.
But	I	wanted	people	to	actually	feel	my	work	from	their	gut	,	because	I	was	painting	it	from	my	gut	.
If	they	wanted	beauty	,	I	said	,	this	is	the	beauty	I	'm	willing	to	give	you	.	It	's	 politicize 	 d 	 	.
Of	course	,	none	of	them	 like 	 d 	 	it	.
My	works	also	turned	 auto 	 biographical 	 	.
At	this	point	,	something	else	happened	.
A	very	,	very	dear	friend	of	mine	came	out	of	the	closet	,	and	in	India	at	that	time	,	it	was	illegal	to	be	gay	,	and	it	's	 disgust 	 ing 	 	to	see	how	people	respond	to	a	gay	person	.
I	was	very	upset	.
I	remember	the	time	when	my	mother	used	to	dress	me	up	as	a	little	girl	--	that	's	me	there	--	because	she	wanted	a	girl	,	and	she	has	only	boys	.
Anyway	,	I	do	n't	know	what	my	friends	are	going	to	say	after	this	talk	.
It	's	a	secret	.
So	,	after	this	,	my	works	turned	a	little	violent	.
I	talked	about	this	masculinity	that	one	need	not	perform	.
And	I	talked	about	the	 weaknes 	 s 	 	of	male	sexuality	.
This	time	,	not	only	did	my	 collector 	 s 	 	disappear	,	the	political	 activist 	 s 	 	decided	to	ban	me	and	to	threaten	me	and	to	forbid	me	from	showing	.
It	turned	nasty	,	and	I	'm	a	bit	of	a	chicken	.
I	ca	n't	deal	with	any	threat	.	This	was	a	big	threat	.
So	,	I	decided	it	was	time	to	end	and	go	back	home	.
This	time	I	said	let	's	try	something	different	.
I	need	to	be	 re 	 born 	 	again	.
And	I	thought	the	best	way	,	as	most	of	you	know	who	have	children	,	the	best	way	to	have	a	new	lease	on	life	,	is	to	have	a	child	.
I	decided	to	have	a	child	,	and	before	I	did	that	,	I	quickly	studied	what	can	go	wrong	.
How	can	a	family	get	 dysfunction 	 al 	 	?
And	Rudra	was	born	.
That	's	my	little	son	.
And	two	magical	things	happened	after	he	was	born	.
My	mother	 miraculo 	 usly 	 	recovered	after	a	serious	operation	,	and	this	man	was	elected	president	of	this	country	.
You	know	I	sat	at	home	and	I	 watch 	 ed 	 	.
I	 tear 	 ed 	 	up	and	I	said	that	's	where	I	want	to	be	.
So	Netra	and	I	wound	up	our	life	,	closed	up	everything	we	had	,	and	we	decided	to	move	to	New	York	.
And	this	was	just	eight	months	ago	.
I	moved	back	to	New	York	,	my	work	has	changed	.
Everything	about	my	work	has	become	more	whimsical	.
This	one	is	called	``	What	the	Fuck	Was	I	Thinking	?	''
It	talks	about	mental	incest	.
You	know	,	I	may	appear	to	be	a	very	nice	,	clean	,	sweet	boy	.
But	I	'm	not	.	I	'm	capable	of	thinking	anything	.
But	I	'm	very	civil	in	my	action	,	I	assure	you	.
These	are	just	different	cartoons	.
And	,	before	I	go	,	I	want	to	tell	you	a	little	story	.
I	was	talking	to	mother	and	father	this	morning	,	and	my	dad	said	,	``	I	know	you	have	so	much	you	want	to	say	,	but	you	have	to	talk	about	your	work	with	children	.	''
So	I	said	,	okay	.
I	work	with	children	all	over	the	world	,	and	that	's	an	 entire 	 ly 	 	different	talk	,	but	I	want	to	leave	you	with	one	story	that	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	inspired	me	.
I	met	Belinda	when	she	was	16	.
I	was	17	.
I	was	in	Australia	,	and	Belinda	had	cancer	,	and	I	was	told	she	's	not	going	to	live	very	long	.
They	,	in	fact	,	told	me	three	weeks	.
I	walk	into	her	room	,	and	there	was	a	shy	girl	,	and	she	was	bald	,	and	she	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	hide	her	 bald 	 ness 	 	.
I	whipped	out	my	pen	,	and	I	started	drawing	on	her	head	and	I	drew	a	crown	for	her	.
And	then	,	we	started	talking	,	and	we	spent	a	 love 	 ly 	 	time	--	I	told	her	how	I	ended	up	in	Australia	,	how	I	 backpack 	 ed 	 	and	who	I	conned	,	and	how	I	got	a	ticket	,	and	all	the	stories	.
And	I	drew	it	out	for	her	.
And	then	I	left	.
Belinda	died	and	within	a	few	days	of	her	death	,	they	published	a	book	for	her	,	and	she	used	my	cartoon	on	the	cover	.
And	she	wrote	a	little	note	,	she	said	,	``	Hey	 Rag 	 s 	 	,	thank	you	for	the	magic	carpet	ride	around	the	world	.	''
For	me	,	my	art	is	my	magic	carpet	ride	.
I	hope	you	will	join	me	in	this	magic	carpet	ride	,	and	touch	children	and	be	honest	.

Lisa	 Gan 	 sky 	 	:	The	future	of	business	is	the	``	mesh	''
I	'm	speaking	to	you	about	what	I	call	the	``	mesh	.	''
It	's	 essential 	 ly 	 	a	fundamental	shift	in	our	relationship	with	stuff	,	with	the	things	in	our	lives	.
And	it	's	starting	to	look	at	--	not	always	and	not	for	everything	--	but	in	certain	 moment 	 s 	 	of	time	,	access	to	certain	 kind 	 s 	 	of	goods	and	service	will	trump	ownership	of	them	.
And	so	it	's	the	pursuit	of	better	things	,	easily	shared	.
And	we	come	from	a	long	tradition	of	sharing	.
We	've	shared	transportation	.
We	've	shared	wine	and	food	and	other	 sort 	 s 	 	of	fabulous	 experience 	 s 	 	in	coffee	bars	in	Amsterdam	.
We	've	also	shared	other	 sort 	 s 	 	of	entertainment	--	sports	 arena 	 s 	 	,	public	parks	,	concert	halls	,	libraries	,	universities	.
All	these	things	are	 share 	 - 	 platforms 	 	,	but	sharing	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	starts	and	ends	with	what	I	refer	to	as	the	``	mother	of	all	 share 	 - 	 platforms 	 	.	''
And	as	I	think	about	the	mesh	and	I	think	about	,	well	,	what	's	driving	it	,	how	come	it	's	happening	now	,	I	think	there	's	a	number	of	vectors	that	I	want	to	give	you	as	background	.
One	is	the	recession	--	that	the	recession	has	caused	us	to	 re 	 think 	 	our	relationship	with	the	things	in	our	lives	relative	to	the	value	--	so	starting	to	align	the	value	with	the	true	cost	.
 Second 	 ly 	 	,	population	growth	and	density	into	cities	.
More	people	,	 small 	 er 	 	spaces	,	less	stuff	.
Climate	change	:	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	reduce	the	stress	in	our	personal	lives	and	in	our	communities	and	on	the	planet	.
Also	,	there	's	been	this	recent	distrust	of	big	brands	,	global	big	brands	,	in	a	bunch	of	different	industries	,	and	that	's	created	an	opening	.
Research	is	showing	here	,	in	the	States	,	and	in	Canada	and	Western	Europe	,	that	most	of	us	are	much	more	open	to	local	companies	,	or	brands	that	maybe	we	have	n't	heard	of	.
Whereas	before	,	we	went	with	the	big	brands	that	we	were	sure	we	trusted	.
And	last	is	that	we	're	more	connected	now	to	more	people	on	the	planet	than	ever	before	--	except	for	if	you	're	sitting	next	to	someone	.
The	other	thing	that	's	worth	 consider 	 ing 	 	is	that	we	've	made	a	huge	investment	over	decades	and	decades	,	and	tens	of	 billion 	 s 	 	of	dollars	have	gone	into	this	investment	that	now	is	our	inheritance	.
It	's	a	physical	infrastructure	that	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	get	from	point	A	to	point	B	and	move	things	that	way	.
It	's	also	--	Web	and	mobile	allow	us	to	be	connected	and	create	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	platforms	and	systems	,	and	the	investment	of	those	technologies	and	that	infrastructure	is	 re 	 ally 	 	our	inheritance	.
It	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	engage	in	 re 	 ally 	 	new	and	 interest 	 ing 	 	ways	.
And	so	for	me	,	a	mesh	company	,	the	``	classic	''	mesh	company	,	 bring 	 s 	 	together	these	three	things	:	our	ability	to	connect	to	each	other	--	most	of	us	are	walking	around	with	these	mobile	devices	that	are	 GPS 	 - 	 enabled 	 	and	 Web 	 - 	 enabled 	 	--	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	find	each	other	and	find	things	in	time	and	space	.
And	third	is	that	physical	things	are	 read 	 able 	 	on	a	map	--	so	 restaurant 	 s 	 	,	a	variety	of	venues	,	but	also	with	GPS	and	other	technology	like	RFID	and	it	continues	to	expand	beyond	that	,	we	can	also	track	things	that	are	moving	,	like	a	car	,	a	 taxic 	 ab 	 	,	a	transit	system	,	a	box	that	's	moving	through	time	and	space	.
And	so	that	sets	up	for	making	access	to	get	goods	and	services	more	convenient	and	less	 cost 	 ly 	 	in	many	cases	than	owning	them	.
For	example	,	I	want	to	use	 Zip 	 car 	 	.
How	many	people	here	have	 experience 	 d 	 	 car 	 - 	 sharing 	 	or	 bike 	 - 	 sharing 	 	?
Wow	,	that	's	great	.	Okay	,	thank	you	.
is	the	largest	 car 	 - 	 sharing 	 	company	in	the	world	.
They	did	not	invent	 car 	 - 	 sharing 	 	.
 Car 	 - 	 sharing 	 	was	actually	 invent 	 ed 	 	in	Europe	.
One	of	the	founders	went	to	Switzerland	,	saw	it	implemented	 some 	 place 	 	,	said	,	``	Wow	,	that	looks	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	.
I	think	we	can	do	that	in	Cambridge	,	''	brought	it	to	Cambridge	and	they	started	--	two	women	--	Robin	Chase	being	the	other	person	who	started	it	.
 Zip 	 car 	 	got	some	 re 	 ally 	 	important	things	right	.
First	,	they	 re 	 ally 	 	understood	that	a	brand	is	a	voice	and	a	product	is	a	souvenir	.
And	so	they	were	very	clever	about	the	way	that	they	packaged	 car 	 - 	 sharing 	 	.
They	made	it	sexy	.	They	made	it	fresh	.
They	made	it	 a 	 spirational 	 	.
If	you	were	a	member	of	the	club	,	when	you	're	a	member	of	a	club	,	you	're	a	 Zip 	 ster 	 	.
The	cars	they	picked	did	n't	look	like	 ex 	 - 	 cop 	 	cars	that	were	 hollow 	 ed 	 	out	or	something	.
They	picked	these	sexy	cars	.
They	targeted	to	universities	.
They	made	sure	that	the	demographic	for	who	they	were	targeting	and	the	car	was	all	matching	.
It	was	a	very	nice	experience	,	and	the	cars	were	clean	and	reliable	,	and	it	all	worked	.
And	so	from	a	branding	perspective	,	they	got	a	lot	right	.
But	they	understood	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	that	they	are	not	a	car	company	.
They	understand	that	they	are	an	information	company	.
Because	when	we	buy	a	car	we	go	to	the	dealer	once	,	we	have	an	interaction	,	and	we	're	chow	--	usually	as	quickly	as	possible	.
But	when	you	're	sharing	a	car	and	you	have	a	 car 	 - 	 share 	 	service	,	you	might	use	an	E.V	.	to	commute	,	you	get	a	truck	because	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	a	home	project	.
When	you	pick	your	aunt	up	at	the	airport	,	you	get	a	sedan	.
And	you	're	going	to	the	mountains	to	ski	,	you	get	different	 accessorie 	 s 	 	put	on	the	car	for	 do 	 ing 	 	that	sort	of	thing	.
Meanwhile	,	these	guys	are	sitting	back	,	 collect 	 ing 	 	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	data	about	our	behavior	and	how	we	interact	with	the	service	.
And	so	it	's	not	only	an	option	for	them	,	but	I	believe	it	's	an	imperative	for	 Zip 	 car 	 	and	other	mesh	companies	to	actually	just	wow	us	,	to	be	like	a	concierge	service	.
Because	we	give	them	so	much	information	,	and	they	are	entitled	to	 re 	 ally 	 	see	how	it	is	that	we	're	moving	.
They	're	in	 re 	 ally 	 	good	shape	to	 anticipat 	 e 	 	what	we	're	going	to	want	next	.
And	so	what	percent	of	the	day	do	you	think	the	average	person	uses	a	car	?
What	percentage	of	the	time	?
Any	 guess 	 es 	 	?
Those	are	 re 	 ally 	 	very	good	.
I	was	 imagin 	 ing 	 	it	was	like	20	percent	when	I	first	started	.
The	number	across	the	U.S.	and	Western	Europe	is	eight	percent	.
And	so	 bas 	 ically 	 	even	if	you	think	it	's	10	percent	,	90	percent	of	the	time	,	something	that	costs	us	a	lot	of	money	--	 personal 	 ly 	 	,	and	also	we	organize	our	cities	around	it	and	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	things	--	90	percent	of	the	time	it	's	sitting	around	.
So	for	this	reason	,	I	think	one	of	the	other	themes	with	the	mesh	is	 essential 	 ly 	 	that	,	if	we	squeeze	hard	on	things	that	we	've	thrown	away	,	there	's	a	lot	of	value	in	those	things	.
What	set	up	with	 Zip 	 car 	 	--	 Zip 	 car 	 	started	in	2000	.
In	the	last	year	,	2010	,	two	car	companies	started	,	one	that	's	in	the	U.K.	called	 Whip 	 Car 	 	,	and	the	other	one	,	 Relay 	 Ride 	 s 	 	,	in	the	 U 	 .S 	 	.
They	're	both	 peer 	 - 	 to 	 - 	 peer 	 	 car 	 - 	 sharing 	 	services	,	because	the	two	things	that	 re 	 ally 	 	work	for	 car 	 - 	 sharing 	 	is	,	one	,	the	car	has	to	be	available	,	and	two	,	it	's	within	one	or	two	blocks	of	where	you	stand	.
Well	the	car	that	's	one	or	two	blocks	from	your	home	or	your	office	is	probably	your	neighbor	's	car	,	and	it	's	probably	also	available	.
So	people	have	created	this	business	.
 Zip 	 car 	 	started	a	decade	earlier	,	in	2000	.
It	took	them	six	years	to	get	1,000	cars	in	service	.
 Whip 	 Car 	 	,	which	started	April	of	last	year	,	it	took	them	six	months	to	get	1,000	cars	in	the	service	.
So	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
People	are	making	anywhere	between	200	and	700	dollars	a	month	letting	their	 neighbor 	 s 	 	use	their	car	when	they	're	not	 us 	 ing 	 	it	.
So	it	's	like	vacation	 rental 	 s 	 	for	cars	.
Since	I	'm	here	--	and	I	hope	some	people	in	the	audience	are	in	the	car	business	--	--	I	'm	thinking	that	,	coming	from	the	technology	side	of	things	--	we	saw	 cable 	 - 	 ready 	 	 TV 	 s 	 	and	 WiFi 	 - 	 ready 	 	 Notebook 	 s 	 	--	it	would	be	 re 	 ally 	 	great	if	,	any	minute	now	,	you	guys	could	start	rolling	 share 	 - 	 ready 	 	cars	off	.
Because	it	just	 create 	 s 	 	more	flexibility	.
It	 allow 	 s 	 	us	as	owners	to	have	other	options	.
And	I	think	we	're	going	there	 any 	 way 	 	.
The	opportunity	and	the	challenge	with	mesh	businesses	--	and	those	are	businesses	like	 Zip 	 car 	 	or	 Net 	 flix 	 	that	are	full	mesh	businesses	,	or	other	ones	where	you	have	a	lot	of	the	car	companies	,	car	 manufacturer 	 s 	 	,	who	are	beginning	to	offer	their	own	 car 	 - 	 share 	 	services	as	well	as	a	second	 flank 	 er 	 	brand	,	or	as	 re 	 ally 	 	a	test	,	I	think	--	is	to	make	sharing	 irresisti 	 ble 	 	.
We	have	 experience 	 s 	 	in	our	lives	,	 certain 	 ly 	 	,	when	sharing	has	been	 irresisti 	 ble 	 	.
It	's	just	,	how	do	we	make	that	 re 	 current 	 	and	scale	it	?
We	know	also	,	because	we	're	connected	in	social	networks	,	that	it	's	easy	to	create	delight	in	one	little	place	.
It	's	 contagio 	 us 	 	because	we	're	all	connected	to	each	other	.
So	if	I	have	a	terrific	experience	and	I	tweet	it	,	or	I	tell	five	people	standing	next	to	me	,	news	 travel 	 s 	 	.
The	opposite	,	as	we	know	,	is	also	true	,	often	more	true	.
So	here	we	have	 Ludo 	 Truck 	 	,	which	is	in	L.A.	,	 do 	 ing 	 	the	things	that	gourmet	food	trucks	do	,	and	they	've	gathered	quite	a	following	.
In	general	,	and	maybe	,	again	,	it	's	because	I	'm	a	tech	entrepreneur	,	I	look	at	things	as	platforms	.
Platforms	are	 invitation 	 s 	 	.
So	creating	Craigslist	or	iTunes	and	the	iPhone	developer	network	,	there	are	all	these	networks	--	Facebook	as	well	.
These	platforms	invite	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 developer 	 s 	 	and	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	people	to	come	with	their	ideas	and	their	opportunity	to	create	and	target	an	application	for	a	particular	audience	.
And	 honest 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	full	of	 surprise 	 s 	 	.
Because	I	do	n't	think	any	of	us	in	this	room	could	have	 predict 	 ed 	 	the	 sort 	 s 	 	of	applications	that	have	happened	at	Facebook	,	around	Facebook	,	for	example	,	two	years	ago	,	when	Mark	announced	that	they	were	going	to	go	with	a	platform	.
So	in	this	way	,	I	think	that	cities	are	platforms	,	and	 certain 	 ly 	 	Detroit	is	a	platform	.
The	invitation	of	bringing	makers	and	artists	and	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	--	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 help 	 s 	 	stimulate	this	 fier 	 y 	 	creativity	and	 help 	 s 	 	a	city	to	thrive	.
It	's	 invit 	 ing 	 	participation	,	and	cities	have	,	 historical 	 ly 	 	,	invited	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	participation	.
Now	we	're	saying	that	there	's	other	options	as	well	.
So	,	for	example	,	city	departments	can	open	up	transit	data	.
Google	has	made	available	transit	data	API	.
And	so	there	's	about	seven	or	eight	cities	already	in	the	 U 	 .S 	 	.
that	have	provided	the	transit	data	,	and	different	 developer 	 s 	 	are	building	applications	.
So	I	was	having	a	coffee	in	Portland	,	and	 half 	 - 	 of 	 - 	 a 	 - 	 latte 	 	in	and	the	little	board	in	the	cafe	all	of	a	sudden	starts	showing	me	that	the	next	bus	is	coming	in	three	minutes	and	the	train	is	coming	in	16	minutes	.
And	so	it	's	reliable	,	real	data	that	's	right	in	my	face	,	where	I	am	,	so	I	can	finish	the	latte	.
There	's	this	fabulous	opportunity	we	have	across	the	U.S.	now	:	about	21	percent	of	vacant	commercial	and	industrial	space	.
That	space	is	not	vital	.
The	areas	around	it	lack	 vital 	 ity 	 	and	 vibra 	 ncy 	 	and	engagement	.
There	's	this	thing	--	how	many	people	here	have	heard	of	 pop 	 - 	 up 	 	stores	or	 pop 	 - 	 up 	 	shops	?
Oh	,	great	.	So	I	'm	a	big	fan	of	this	.
And	this	is	a	very	 mesh 	 - 	 y 	 	thing	.
Essentially	,	there	are	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 restaurant 	 s 	 	in	Oakland	,	near	where	I	live	.
There	's	a	 pop 	 - 	 up 	 	general	store	every	three	weeks	,	and	they	do	a	fantastic	job	of	making	a	very	social	event	happening	for	 food 	 ies 	 	.
Super	fun	,	and	it	 happen 	 s 	 	in	a	very	 transition 	 al 	 	neighborhood	.
Subsequent	to	that	,	after	it	's	been	going	for	about	a	year	now	,	they	actually	started	to	lease	and	create	and	extend	.
An	area	that	was	 ed 	 gy 	 - 	 arts 	 y 	 	is	now	starting	to	become	much	cooler	and	engage	a	lot	more	people	.
So	this	is	an	example	.
The	 Craft 	 y 	 	Fox	is	this	woman	who	's	into	crafts	,	and	she	does	these	 pop 	 - 	 up 	 	crafts	 fair 	 s 	 	around	London	.
But	these	 sort 	 s 	 	of	things	are	happening	in	many	different	 environment 	 s 	 	.
From	my	perspective	,	one	of	the	things	 pop 	 - 	 up 	 	stores	do	is	create	 perish 	 ability 	 	and	urgency	.
It	 create 	 s 	 	two	of	the	 favorit 	 e 	 	words	of	any	 business 	 person 	 	:	sold	out	.
And	the	opportunity	to	 re 	 ally 	 	focus	trust	and	attention	is	a	wonderful	thing	.
So	a	lot	of	what	we	see	in	the	mesh	,	and	a	lot	of	what	we	have	in	the	platform	that	we	built	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	define	,	 re 	 fine 	 	and	scale	.
It	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	test	things	as	an	entrepreneur	,	to	go	to	market	,	to	be	in	conversation	with	people	,	listen	,	 re 	 fine 	 	something	and	go	back	.
It	's	very	 cost 	 - 	 effective 	 	,	and	it	's	very	 mesh 	 - 	 y 	 	.
The	infrastructure	 en 	 ables 	 	that	.
In	closing	,	and	as	we	're	moving	towards	the	end	,	I	just	also	want	to	encourage	--	and	I	'm	willing	to	share	my	failures	as	well	,	though	not	from	the	stage	.
I	would	just	like	to	say	that	one	of	the	big	things	,	when	we	look	at	waste	and	when	we	look	at	ways	that	we	can	 re 	 ally 	 	be	generous	and	 contribut 	 e 	 	to	each	other	,	but	also	move	to	create	a	better	economic	situation	and	a	better	environmental	situation	,	is	by	sharing	failures	.
And	one	quick	example	is	 Veli 	 b 	 	,	in	2007	,	came	forward	in	Paris	with	a	very	bold	proposition	,	a	very	big	 bike 	 - 	 sharing 	 	service	.
They	made	a	lot	of	 mistake 	 s 	 	.
They	had	some	number	of	big	successes	.
But	they	were	very	transparent	,	or	they	had	to	be	,	in	the	way	that	they	exposed	what	worked	and	did	n't	work	.
And	so	 B 	 .C 	 	.	in	Barcelona	and	 B 	 - 	 cycle 	 	and	Boris	Bikes	in	London	--	no	one	has	had	to	repeat	the	version	1.0	 screw 	 - 	 ups 	 	and	expensive	learning	 exercise 	 s 	 	that	happened	in	Paris	.
So	the	opportunity	when	we	're	connected	is	also	to	share	failures	and	successes	.
We	're	at	the	very	beginning	of	something	that	,	what	we	're	seeing	and	the	way	that	mesh	companies	are	coming	forward	,	is	 invit 	 ing 	 	,	it	's	engaging	,	but	it	's	very	early	.
I	have	a	website	--	it	's	a	directory	--	and	it	started	with	about	1,200	companies	,	and	in	the	last	 two 	 - 	 and 	 - 	 a 	 - 	 half 	 	months	it	's	up	to	about	3,300	companies	.
And	it	 grow 	 s 	 	on	a	very	regular	daily	basis	.
But	it	's	very	much	at	the	beginning	.
So	I	just	want	to	welcome	all	of	you	onto	the	ride	.
And	thank	you	very	much	.

JR	's	TED	Prize	wish	:	Use	art	to	turn	the	world	inside	out
Two	weeks	ago	I	was	in	my	studio	in	Paris	,	and	the	phone	rang	and	I	heard	,	``	Hey	,	JR	,	you	won	the	TED	Prize	2011	.
You	have	to	make	a	wish	to	save	the	world	.	''
I	was	lost	.
I	mean	,	I	ca	n't	save	the	world	.	Nobody	can	.
The	world	is	 fuck 	 ed 	 	up	.
Come	on	,	you	have	 dictator 	 s 	 	ruling	the	world	,	population	is	growing	by	 million 	 s 	 	,	there	's	no	more	fish	in	the	sea	,	the	North	Pole	is	melting	and	as	the	last	TED	Prize	winner	said	,	we	're	all	becoming	fat	.
Except	maybe	French	people	.
Whatever	.
So	I	called	back	and	I	told	her	,	``	Look	,	Amy	,	tell	the	TED	guys	I	just	wo	n't	show	up	.
I	ca	n't	do	anything	to	save	the	world	.	''
She	said	,	``	Hey	,	JR	,	your	wish	is	not	to	save	the	world	,	but	to	change	the	world	.	''
``	Oh	,	all	right	.	''
``	That	's	cool	.	''
I	mean	,	technology	,	politics	,	business	do	change	the	world	--	not	always	in	a	good	way	,	but	they	do	.
What	about	art	?
Could	art	change	the	world	?
I	started	when	I	was	15	years	old	.
And	at	that	time	,	I	was	not	thinking	about	changing	the	world	.
I	was	 do 	 ing 	 	graffiti	--	writing	my	name	everywhere	,	 us 	 ing 	 	the	city	as	a	canvas	.
I	was	going	in	the	 tunnel 	 s 	 	of	Paris	,	on	the	 rooftop 	 s 	 	with	my	friends	.
Each	trip	was	an	excursion	,	was	an	adventure	.
It	was	like	leaving	our	mark	on	society	,	to	say	,	``	I	was	here	,	''	on	the	top	of	a	building	.
So	when	I	found	a	cheap	camera	on	the	subway	,	I	started	 document 	 ing 	 	those	 adventure 	 s 	 	with	my	friends	and	gave	them	back	as	 photo 	 copies 	 	--	 re 	 ally 	 	small	photos	just	that	size	.
That	's	how	,	at	17	years	old	,	I	started	 past 	 ing 	 	them	.
And	I	did	my	first	``	expo	de	rue	,	''	which	means	 side 	 walk 	 	gallery	.
And	I	framed	it	with	color	so	you	would	not	 confus 	 e 	 	it	with	advertising	.
I	mean	,	the	city	's	the	best	gallery	I	could	imagine	.
I	would	never	have	to	make	a	book	and	then	present	it	to	a	gallery	and	let	them	decide	if	my	work	was	nice	enough	to	show	it	to	people	.
I	would	control	it	directly	with	the	public	in	the	streets	.
So	that	's	Paris	.
I	would	change	--	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	the	places	I	would	go	--	the	title	of	the	exhibition	.
That	's	on	the	 Champs 	 - 	 Elyse 	 es 	 	.
I	was	quite	proud	of	that	one	.
Because	I	was	just	18	and	I	was	just	up	there	on	the	top	of	the	 Champs 	 - 	 Elyse 	 es 	 	.
Then	when	the	photo	left	,	the	frame	was	still	there	.
November	2005	:	the	streets	are	burning	.
A	large	wave	of	riots	had	broken	into	the	first	projects	of	Paris	.
Everyone	was	glued	to	the	TV	,	watching	 disturb 	 ing 	 	,	 frighten 	 ing 	 	images	taken	from	the	edge	of	the	neighborhood	.
I	mean	,	these	kids	,	without	control	,	throwing	Molotov	 cocktail 	 s 	 	,	 attack 	 ing 	 	the	cops	and	the	 fire 	 men 	 	,	 loo 	 ting 	 	everything	they	could	in	the	shops	.
These	were	 criminal 	 s 	 	,	 crook 	 s 	 	,	dangerous	,	 pursu 	 ing 	 	their	own	environment	.
And	then	I	saw	it	--	could	it	be	possible	?	--	my	photo	on	a	wall	revealed	by	a	burning	car	--	a	 past 	 ing 	 	I	'd	done	a	year	earlier	--	an	illegal	one	--	still	there	.
I	mean	,	these	were	the	faces	of	my	friends	.
I	know	those	guys	.
All	of	them	are	not	angels	,	but	they	're	not	monsters	either	.
So	it	was	kind	of	weird	to	see	those	images	and	those	eyes	 star 	 e 	 	back	at	me	through	a	television	.
So	I	went	back	there	with	a	28	mm	lens	.
It	was	the	only	one	I	had	at	that	time	.
But	with	that	lens	,	you	have	to	be	as	close	as	10	inches	from	the	person	.
So	you	can	do	it	only	with	their	trust	.
So	I	took	four	 portrait 	 s 	 	of	people	from	Le	 Bosque 	 t 	 	.
They	were	making	 s 	 cary 	 	faces	to	play	the	caricature	of	themselves	.
And	then	I	pasted	huge	 poster 	 s 	 	everywhere	in	the	bourgeois	area	of	Paris	with	the	name	,	age	,	even	building	number	of	these	guys	.
A	year	later	,	the	exhibition	was	 display 	 ed 	 	in	front	of	the	city	hall	of	Paris	.
And	we	go	from	took	images	,	who	've	been	stolen	and	 distort 	 ed 	 	by	the	media	,	who	's	now	 proud 	 ly 	 	taking	over	his	own	image	.
That	's	where	I	 re 	 alized 	 	the	power	of	paper	and	glue	.
So	could	art	change	the	world	?
A	year	later	,	I	was	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	all	the	noise	about	the	Middle	East	conflict	.
I	mean	,	at	that	time	,	trust	me	,	they	were	only	 re 	 ferring 	 	to	the	Israeli	and	Palestinian	conflict	.
So	with	my	friend	Marco	,	we	decided	to	go	there	and	see	who	are	the	real	 Palestinian 	 s 	 	and	who	are	the	real	 Israeli 	 s 	 	.
Are	they	so	different	?
When	we	got	there	,	we	just	went	in	the	street	,	started	talking	with	people	everywhere	,	and	we	 re 	 alized 	 	that	things	were	a	bit	different	from	the	rhetoric	we	heard	in	the	media	.
So	we	decided	to	take	 portrait 	 s 	 	of	 Palestinian 	 s 	 	and	 Israeli 	 s 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	the	same	jobs	--	 taxi 	 - 	 driver 	 	,	lawyer	,	 cook 	 s 	 	.
Asked	them	to	make	a	face	as	a	sign	of	commitment	.
Not	a	smile	--	that	 re 	 ally 	 	does	n't	tell	about	who	you	are	and	what	you	feel	.
They	all	accepted	to	be	pasted	next	to	the	other	.
I	decided	to	paste	in	eight	Israeli	and	Palestinian	cities	and	on	both	sides	of	the	wall	.
We	launched	the	biggest	illegal	art	exhibition	ever	.
We	called	the	project	Face	2	Face	.
The	experts	said	,	``	No	way	.
The	people	will	not	accept	.
The	army	will	shoot	you	,	and	Hamas	will	kidnap	you	.	''
We	said	,	``	Okay	,	let	's	try	and	push	as	far	as	we	can	.	''
I	love	the	way	that	people	will	ask	me	,	``	How	big	will	my	photo	be	?	''
``	It	will	be	as	big	as	your	house	.	''
When	we	did	the	wall	,	we	did	the	Palestinian	side	.
So	we	 arriv 	 ed 	 	with	just	our	 ladder 	 s 	 	and	we	 re 	 alized 	 	that	they	were	not	high	enough	.
And	so	 Palestinian 	 s 	 	guys	say	,	``	Calm	down	.	No	wait	.	I	'm	going	to	find	you	a	solution	.	''
So	he	went	to	the	Church	of	Nativity	and	brought	back	an	old	ladder	that	was	so	old	that	it	could	have	seen	Jesus	being	born	.
We	did	Face	2	Face	with	only	six	friends	,	two	 ladder 	 s 	 	,	two	brushes	,	a	 rent 	 ed 	 	car	,	a	camera	and	20,000	square	feet	of	paper	.
We	had	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	help	from	all	walks	of	life	.
Okay	,	for	example	,	that	's	Palestine	.
We	're	in	 Ram 	 allah 	 	right	now	.
We	're	 past 	 ing 	 	 portrait 	 s 	 	--	so	both	 portrait 	 s 	 	in	the	streets	in	a	crowded	market	.
People	come	around	us	and	start	 as 	 king 	 	,	``	What	are	you	 do 	 ing 	 	here	?	''
``	Oh	,	we	're	actually	 do 	 ing 	 	an	art	project	and	we	are	placing	an	Israeli	and	a	Palestinian	 do 	 ing 	 	the	same	job	.
And	those	ones	are	actually	two	 taxi 	 - 	 drivers 	 	.	''
And	then	there	was	always	a	silence	.
``	You	mean	you	're	 past 	 ing 	 	an	Israeli	face	--	 do 	 ing 	 	a	face	--	right	here	?	''
``	Well	,	yeah	,	yeah	,	that	's	part	of	the	project	.	''
And	I	would	always	leave	that	moment	,	and	we	would	ask	them	,	``	So	can	you	tell	me	who	is	who	?	''
And	most	of	them	could	n't	say	.
We	even	pasted	on	Israeli	military	towers	,	and	nothing	happened	.
When	you	paste	an	image	,	it	's	just	paper	and	glue	.
People	can	tear	it	,	tag	on	it	,	or	even	pee	on	it	--	some	are	a	bit	high	for	that	,	I	agree	--	but	the	people	in	the	street	,	they	are	the	curator	.
The	rain	and	the	wind	will	take	them	off	 any 	 way 	 	.
They	are	not	meant	to	stay	.
But	 exact 	 ly 	 	four	years	after	,	the	photos	,	most	of	them	are	still	there	.
Face	2	Face	 demonstrat 	 ed 	 	that	what	we	thought	impossible	was	possible	--	and	,	you	know	what	,	even	easy	.
We	did	n't	push	the	limit	;	we	just	 show 	 ed 	 	that	they	were	further	than	 any 	 one 	 	thought	.
In	the	Middle	East	,	I	 experience 	 d 	 	my	work	in	places	without	[	many	]	 museum 	 s 	 	.
So	this	direction	in	the	street	were	kind	of	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
So	I	decided	to	go	further	in	this	direction	and	go	in	places	where	there	were	zero	 museum 	 s 	 	.
When	you	go	in	these	developing	societies	,	women	are	the	 pillar 	 s 	 	of	their	community	,	but	the	men	are	still	the	ones	holding	the	streets	.
So	we	were	inspired	to	create	a	project	where	men	will	pay	tribute	to	women	by	 post 	 ing 	 	their	photos	.
I	called	that	project	Women	Are	Heroes	.
When	I	 listen 	 ed 	 	to	all	the	stories	everywhere	I	went	on	the	 continent 	 s 	 	,	I	could	n't	always	understand	the	complicated	 circumstance 	 s 	 	of	their	conflict	.
I	just	observed	.
Sometimes	there	was	no	words	,	no	sentence	,	just	tears	.
I	just	took	their	pictures	and	pasted	them	.
Women	Are	Heroes	took	me	around	the	world	.
Most	of	the	places	I	went	to	,	I	decided	to	go	there	because	I	've	heard	about	it	through	the	media	.
So	for	example	,	in	June	2008	,	I	was	watching	TV	in	Paris	,	and	then	I	heard	about	this	terrible	thing	that	happened	in	Rio	de	Janeiro	--	the	first	 fa 	 vela 	 	of	Brazil	named	 Providenc 	 ia 	 	.
Three	kids	--	that	was	three	students	--	were	[	 de 	 tained 	 	]	by	the	army	because	they	were	not	carrying	their	papers	.
And	the	army	took	them	,	and	instead	of	bringing	them	to	the	police	station	,	they	brought	them	to	an	enemy	 fa 	 vela 	 	where	they	get	chopped	into	pieces	.
I	was	 shock 	 ed 	 	.
All	Brazil	was	 shock 	 ed 	 	.
I	heard	it	was	one	of	the	most	violent	 fa 	 velas 	 	,	because	the	largest	drug	cartel	controls	it	.
So	I	decided	to	go	there	.
When	I	 arriv 	 ed 	 	--	I	mean	,	I	did	n't	have	any	contact	with	any	NGO	.
There	was	none	in	place	--	no	tourist	agent	,	no	NGOs	,	nothing	--	So	we	just	walked	around	,	and	we	met	a	woman	,	and	I	 show 	 ed 	 	her	my	book	.
And	she	said	,	``	You	know	what	?
We	're	hungry	for	culture	.
We	need	culture	out	there	.	''
So	I	went	out	and	I	started	with	the	kids	.
I	just	took	a	few	photos	of	the	kids	,	and	the	next	day	I	came	with	the	 poster 	 s 	 	and	we	pasted	them	.
The	day	after	,	I	came	back	and	they	were	already	 scratch 	 ed 	 	.
But	that	's	okay	.
I	wanted	them	to	feel	that	this	art	 belong 	 s 	 	to	them	.
Then	the	next	day	,	I	held	a	meeting	on	the	main	square	and	some	women	came	.
They	were	all	linked	to	the	three	kids	that	got	killed	.
There	was	the	mother	,	the	grandmother	,	the	best	friend	--	they	all	wanted	to	shout	the	story	.
After	that	day	,	everyone	in	the	 fa 	 vela 	 	gave	me	the	green	light	.
I	took	more	photos	,	and	we	started	the	project	.
The	drug	lords	were	kind	of	worried	about	us	filming	in	the	place	,	so	I	told	them	,	``	You	know	what	?
I	'm	not	interested	in	filming	the	violence	and	the	weapons	.
You	see	that	enough	in	the	media	.
What	I	want	to	show	is	the	 incredibl 	 e 	 	life	.
And	actually	I	've	been	seeing	it	around	me	the	last	few	days	.	''
So	that	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	symbolic	 past 	 ing 	 	,	because	that	's	the	first	one	we	did	that	you	could	n't	see	from	the	city	.
And	that	's	where	the	three	kids	got	arrested	,	and	that	's	the	grandmother	of	one	of	them	.
And	on	that	stairs	,	that	's	where	the	 trafficker 	 s 	 	always	stand	and	there	's	a	lot	of	exchange	of	fire	.
Everyone	there	understood	the	project	.
And	then	we	pasted	everywhere	--	the	whole	hill	.
What	was	 interest 	 ing 	 	is	that	the	media	could	n't	get	in	.
I	mean	,	you	should	see	that	.
They	would	have	to	film	us	from	a	 re 	 ally 	 	long	distance	by	helicopter	and	then	have	a	 re 	 ally 	 	long	lens	,	and	we	would	see	 our 	 selves 	 	,	on	TV	,	 past 	 ing 	 	.
And	they	would	put	a	number	:	``	Please	call	this	number	if	you	know	what	's	going	on	in	 Providenc 	 ia 	 	.	''
We	just	did	a	project	and	then	left	so	the	media	would	n't	know	.
So	how	can	we	know	about	the	project	?
So	they	had	to	go	and	find	the	women	and	get	an	explanation	from	them	.
So	you	create	a	bridge	between	the	media	and	the	anonymous	women	.
We	kept	 travel 	 ing 	 	.
We	went	to	Africa	,	Sudan	,	Sierra	Leone	,	In	 war 	 - 	 torn 	 	places	like	 Mon 	 rovia 	 	,	people	come	straight	to	you	.
I	mean	,	they	want	to	know	what	you	're	up	to	.
They	kept	 as 	 king 	 	me	,	``	What	is	the	purpose	of	your	project	?
Are	you	an	NGO	?	Are	you	the	media	?	''
Art	.	Just	 do 	 ing 	 	art	.
Some	people	question	,	``	Why	is	it	in	black	and	white	?
Do	n't	you	have	color	in	France	?	''
Or	they	tell	you	,	``	Are	these	people	all	dead	?	''
Some	who	understood	the	project	would	explain	it	to	others	.
And	to	a	man	who	did	not	understand	,	I	heard	someone	say	,	``	You	know	,	you	've	been	here	for	a	few	hours	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	,	 discuss 	 ing 	 	with	your	fellows	.
During	that	time	,	you	have	n't	thought	about	what	you	're	going	to	eat	tomorrow	.
This	is	art	.	''
I	think	it	's	people	's	curiosity	that	 motivate 	 s 	 	them	to	come	into	the	projects	.
And	then	it	becomes	more	.
It	becomes	a	desire	,	a	need	,	an	armor	.
On	this	bridge	that	's	in	 Mon 	 rovia 	 	,	an	 ex 	 - 	 rebel 	 	soldier	 help 	 ed 	 	us	 past 	 ing 	 	a	portrait	of	a	woman	that	might	have	been	 rap 	 ed 	 	during	the	war	.
Women	are	always	the	first	ones	targeted	during	conflict	.
This	is	 Kiber 	 a 	 	,	Kenya	,	one	of	the	largest	 slum 	 s 	 	of	Africa	.
You	might	have	seen	images	about	the	 post 	 - 	 election 	 	violence	that	happened	there	in	2008	.
This	time	we	covered	the	 roof 	 s 	 	of	the	houses	,	but	we	did	n't	use	paper	,	because	paper	does	n't	prevent	the	rain	from	 leak 	 ing 	 	inside	the	house	--	vinyl	does	.
Then	art	becomes	useful	.
So	the	people	kept	it	.
You	know	what	I	love	is	,	for	example	,	when	you	see	the	biggest	eye	there	,	there	are	so	[	many	]	houses	inside	.
And	I	went	there	a	few	months	ago	--	photos	are	still	there	--	and	it	was	missing	a	piece	of	the	eye	.
So	I	asked	the	people	what	happened	.
``	Oh	,	that	guy	just	moved	.	''
When	the	 roof 	 s 	 	were	covered	,	a	woman	said	as	a	joke	,	``	Now	God	can	see	me	.	''
When	you	look	at	 Kiber 	 a 	 	now	,	they	look	back	.
Okay	,	India	.
Before	I	start	that	,	just	so	you	know	,	each	time	we	go	to	a	place	,	we	do	n't	have	a	tourist	agent	,	so	we	set	up	like	 commando 	 s 	 	--	we	're	a	group	of	friends	who	arrive	there	,	and	we	try	to	paste	on	the	walls	.
But	there	are	places	where	you	just	ca	n't	paste	on	a	wall	.
In	India	it	was	just	impossible	to	paste	.
I	heard	 cultural 	 ly 	 	and	because	of	the	law	,	they	would	just	arrest	us	at	the	first	 past 	 ing 	 	.
So	we	decided	to	paste	white	,	white	on	the	walls	.
So	imagine	white	guys	 past 	 ing 	 	white	papers	.
So	people	would	come	to	us	and	ask	us	,	``	Hey	,	what	are	you	up	to	?	''
``	Oh	,	you	know	,	we	're	just	 do 	 ing 	 	art	.	''	``	Art	?	''
Of	course	,	they	were	 confus 	 ed 	 	.
But	you	know	how	India	has	a	lot	of	dust	in	the	streets	,	and	the	more	dust	you	would	have	going	up	in	the	air	,	on	the	white	paper	you	can	almost	see	,	but	there	is	this	sticky	part	like	when	you	reverse	a	sticker	.
So	the	more	dust	you	have	,	the	more	it	will	reveal	the	photo	.
So	we	could	just	walk	in	the	street	during	the	next	days	and	the	photos	would	get	revealed	by	themselves	.
Thank	you	.
So	we	did	n't	get	caught	this	time	.
Each	project	--	that	's	a	film	from	Women	Are	Heroes	.
Okay	.
For	each	project	we	do	a	film	.
And	most	of	what	you	see	--	that	's	a	trailer	from	``	Women	Are	Heroes	''	--	its	images	,	photography	,	taken	one	after	the	other	.
And	the	photo	kept	 travel 	 ing 	 	even	without	us	.
 Hopeful 	 ly 	 	,	you	'll	see	the	film	,	and	you	'll	understand	the	scope	of	the	project	and	what	the	people	felt	when	they	saw	those	photos	.
Because	that	's	a	big	part	of	it	.	There	's	layers	behind	each	photo	.
Behind	each	image	is	a	story	.
Women	Are	Heroes	created	a	new	dynamic	in	each	of	the	communities	,	and	the	women	kept	that	dynamic	after	we	left	.
For	example	,	we	did	books	--	not	for	sale	--	that	all	the	community	would	get	.
But	to	get	it	,	they	would	have	to	[	get	]	it	signed	by	one	of	the	women	.
We	did	that	in	most	of	the	places	.
We	go	back	regularly	.
And	so	in	 Providenc 	 ia 	 	,	for	example	,	in	the	 fa 	 vela 	 	,	we	have	a	controlled	center	running	there	.
In	 Kiber 	 a 	 	,	each	year	we	cover	more	 roof 	 s 	 	.
Because	of	course	,	when	we	left	,	the	people	who	were	just	at	the	edge	of	the	project	said	,	``	Hey	,	what	about	my	roof	?	''
So	we	decided	to	come	the	year	after	and	keep	 do 	 ing 	 	the	project	.
A	 re 	 ally 	 	important	point	for	me	is	that	I	do	n't	use	any	brand	or	corporate	 sponsor 	 s 	 	.
So	I	have	no	responsibility	to	 any 	 one 	 	but	myself	and	the	subjects	.
And	that	is	for	me	one	of	the	more	important	things	in	the	work	.
I	think	,	today	,	as	important	as	the	result	is	the	way	you	do	things	.
And	that	has	always	been	a	certain	part	of	the	work	.
And	what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	is	that	fine	line	that	I	have	with	images	and	advertising	.
We	just	did	some	 past 	 ing 	 	in	Los	Angeles	on	another	project	in	the	last	weeks	.
And	I	was	even	invited	to	cover	the	MOCA	museum	.
But	 yester 	 day 	 	the	city	called	them	and	said	,	``	Look	,	we	're	going	to	have	to	tear	it	down	.
Because	this	can	be	taken	for	advertising	,	and	because	of	the	law	,	it	has	to	be	taken	down	.	''
But	tell	me	,	advertising	for	what	?
The	people	I	photograph	were	proud	to	participate	in	the	project	and	to	have	their	photo	in	the	community	.
But	they	asked	me	for	a	promise	 bas 	 ically 	 	.
They	asked	me	,	``	Please	,	make	our	story	travel	with	you	.	''
So	I	did	.	That	's	Paris	.
That	's	Rio	.
In	each	place	,	we	built	exhibitions	with	a	story	,	and	the	story	 travel 	 ed 	 	.
You	understand	the	full	scope	of	the	project	.
That	's	London	.
New	York	.
And	today	,	they	are	with	you	in	Long	Beach	.
All	right	,	 recent 	 ly 	 	I	started	a	public	art	project	where	I	do	n't	use	my	artwork	 any 	 more 	 	.
I	use	Man	Ray	,	Helen	Levitt	,	 Giacom 	 elli 	 	,	other	people	's	artwork	.
It	does	n't	matter	today	if	it	's	your	photo	or	not	.
The	importance	is	what	you	do	with	the	images	,	the	statement	it	makes	where	it	's	pasted	.
So	for	example	,	I	pasted	the	photo	of	the	minaret	in	Switzerland	a	few	weeks	after	they	voted	the	law	 for 	 bidding 	 	 minaret 	 s 	 	in	the	country	.
This	image	of	three	men	wearing	gas	masks	was	taken	in	Chernobyl	 original 	 ly 	 	,	and	I	pasted	it	in	Southern	Italy	,	where	the	mafia	sometimes	bury	the	garbage	under	the	ground	.
In	some	ways	,	art	can	change	the	world	.
Art	is	not	 s 	 upposed 	 	to	change	the	world	,	to	change	practical	things	,	but	to	change	 perception 	 s 	 	.
Art	can	change	the	way	we	see	the	world	.
Art	can	create	an	analogy	.
Actually	the	fact	that	art	can	not	change	things	makes	it	a	neutral	place	for	 exchange 	 s 	 	and	 discussion 	 s 	 	,	and	then	 en 	 ables 	 	you	to	change	the	world	.
When	I	do	my	work	,	I	have	two	 kind 	 s 	 	of	reactions	.
People	say	,	``	Oh	,	why	do	n't	you	go	in	Iraq	or	Afghanistan	.
They	would	be	 re 	 ally 	 	useful	.	''
Or	,	``	How	can	we	help	?	''
I	 presum 	 e 	 	that	you	belong	to	the	second	category	,	and	that	's	good	,	because	for	that	project	,	I	'm	going	to	ask	you	to	take	the	photos	and	paste	them	.
So	now	my	wish	is	:	I	wish	for	you	to	stand	up	for	what	you	care	about	by	 participat 	 ing 	 	in	a	global	art	project	,	and	together	we	'll	turn	the	world	inside	out	.
And	this	starts	right	now	.
Yes	,	everyone	in	the	room	.
Everyone	watching	.
I	wanted	that	wish	to	actually	start	now	.
So	a	subject	you	're	passionate	about	,	a	person	who	you	want	to	tell	their	story	or	even	your	own	photos	--	tell	me	what	you	stand	for	.
Take	the	photos	,	the	 portrait 	 s 	 	,	upload	it	--	I	'll	give	you	all	the	details	--	and	I	'll	send	you	back	your	poster	.	Join	by	groups	and	reveal	things	to	the	world	.
The	full	data	is	on	the	website	--	 inside 	 out 	 project 	 .net 	 	--	that	is	 launch 	 ing 	 	today	.
What	we	see	changes	who	we	are	.
When	we	act	together	,	the	whole	thing	is	much	more	than	the	sum	of	the	parts	.
So	I	hope	that	,	together	,	we	'll	create	something	that	the	world	will	remember	.
And	this	starts	right	now	and	 depend 	 s 	 	on	you	.
Thank	you	.
Thank	you	.

Abigail	Washburn	:	Building	 US 	 - 	 China 	 	relations	...	by	banjo
If	you	had	caught	me	straight	out	of	college	in	the	halls	of	the	Vermont	State	House	where	I	was	a	lobbyist	in	training	and	asked	me	what	I	was	going	to	do	with	my	life	,	I	would	have	told	you	that	I	'd	just	passed	the	Hanyu	 Shui 	 ping 	 	 Kao 	 shi 	 	,	the	Chinese	 equival 	 ency 	 	exam	,	and	I	was	going	to	go	study	law	in	Beijing	,	and	I	was	going	to	improve	 U.S. 	 - 	 China 	 	relations	through	 top 	 - 	 down 	 	policy	changes	and	judicial	system	reforms	.
I	had	a	plan	,	and	I	never	ever	thought	it	would	have	anything	to	do	with	the	banjo	.
Little	did	I	know	what	a	huge	impact	it	would	have	on	me	one	night	when	I	was	at	a	party	and	I	heard	a	sound	coming	out	of	a	record	player	in	the	corner	of	a	room	.
And	it	was	Doc	Watson	singing	and	playing	``	Shady	Grove	.	''
♫	Shady	Grove	,	my	little	love	♫	♫	Shady	Grove	,	my	 dar 	 lin 	 	'	♫	♫	Shady	Grove	,	my	little	love	♫	♫	Going	back	to	Harlan	♫	That	sound	was	just	so	beautiful	,	the	sound	of	Doc	's	voice	and	the	 rippl 	 ing 	 	groove	of	the	banjo	.
And	after	being	totally	and	 complete 	 ly 	 	 obsess 	 ed 	 	with	the	 mammo 	 th 	 	 rich 	 ness 	 	and	history	of	Chinese	culture	,	it	was	like	this	total	relief	to	hear	something	so	 tru 	 ly 	 	American	and	so	 tru 	 ly 	 	awesome	.
I	knew	I	had	to	take	a	banjo	with	me	to	China	.
So	before	going	to	law	school	in	China	I	bought	a	banjo	,	I	threw	it	in	my	little	red	truck	and	I	 travel 	 ed 	 	down	through	Appalachia	and	I	learned	a	bunch	of	old	American	songs	,	and	I	ended	up	in	Kentucky	at	the	International	Bluegrass	Music	Association	Convention	.
And	I	was	sitting	in	a	 hall 	 way 	 	one	night	and	a	couple	girls	came	up	to	me	.
And	they	said	,	``	Hey	,	do	you	want	to	jam	?	''
And	I	was	like	,	``	Sure	.	''
So	I	picked	up	my	banjo	and	I	 nervous 	 ly 	 	played	four	songs	that	I	actually	knew	with	them	.
And	a	record	executive	walked	up	to	me	and	invited	me	to	Nashville	,	Tennessee	to	make	a	record	.
It	's	been	eight	years	,	and	I	can	tell	you	that	I	did	n't	go	to	China	to	become	a	lawyer	.
In	fact	,	I	went	to	Nashville	.
And	after	a	few	months	I	was	writing	songs	.
And	the	first	song	I	wrote	was	in	English	,	and	the	second	one	was	in	Chinese	.
[	Chinese	]	Outside	your	door	the	world	is	waiting	.
Inside	your	heart	a	voice	is	calling	.
The	four	corners	of	the	world	are	watching	,	so	travel	daughter	,	travel	.
Go	get	it	,	girl	.
It	's	 re 	 ally 	 	been	eight	years	since	that	 fat 	 ed 	 	night	in	Kentucky	.
And	I	've	played	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	shows	.
And	I	've	 collaborate 	 d 	 	with	so	many	 incredibl 	 e 	 	,	 inspiration 	 al 	 	musicians	around	the	world	.
And	I	see	the	power	of	music	.
I	see	the	power	of	music	to	connect	cultures	.
I	see	it	when	I	stand	on	a	stage	in	a	bluegrass	festival	in	east	Virginia	and	I	look	out	at	the	sea	of	lawn	chairs	and	I	bust	out	into	a	song	in	Chinese	.
[	Chinese	]	And	everybody	's	eyes	just	pop	wide	open	like	it	's	going	to	fall	out	of	their	heads	.
And	they	're	like	,	``	What	's	that	girl	 do 	 ing 	 	?	''
And	then	they	come	up	to	me	after	the	show	and	they	all	have	a	story	.
They	all	come	up	and	they	're	like	,	``	You	know	,	my	aunt	's	sister	's	 babysit 	 ter 	 	's	dog	's	chicken	went	to	China	and	adopted	a	girl	.	''
And	I	tell	you	what	,	it	like	everybody	's	got	a	story	.
It	's	just	 incredibl 	 e 	 	.
And	then	I	go	to	China	and	I	stand	on	a	stage	at	a	university	and	I	bust	out	into	a	song	in	Chinese	and	everybody	 s 	 ings 	 	along	and	they	roar	with	delight	at	this	girl	with	the	hair	and	the	instrument	,	and	she	's	singing	their	music	.
And	I	see	,	even	more	 important 	 ly 	 	,	the	power	of	music	to	connect	hearts	.
Like	the	time	I	was	in	Sichuan	Province	and	I	was	singing	for	kids	in	 re 	 location 	 	schools	in	the	earthquake	disaster	zone	.
And	this	little	girl	comes	up	to	me	.
[	Chinese	]	``	Big	sister	Wong	,	''	Washburn	,	Wong	,	same	difference	.
``	Big	sister	Wong	,	can	I	 s 	 ing 	 	you	a	song	that	my	mom	sang	for	me	before	she	was	 swallow 	 ed 	 	in	the	earthquake	?	''
And	I	sat	down	,	she	sat	on	my	lap	.
She	started	singing	her	song	.
And	the	warmth	of	her	body	and	the	tears	rolling	down	her	rosy	 cheek 	 s 	 	,	and	I	started	to	cry	.
And	the	light	that	shone	off	of	her	eyes	was	a	place	I	could	have	stayed	forever	.
And	in	that	moment	,	we	were	n't	our	American	selves	,	we	were	n't	our	Chinese	selves	,	we	were	just	 mortal 	 s 	 	sitting	together	in	that	light	that	keeps	us	here	.
I	want	to	dwell	in	that	light	with	you	and	with	everyone	.
And	I	know	 U.S. 	 - 	 China 	 	relations	does	n't	need	another	lawyer	.
Thank	you	.

A	story	,	a	work	of	art	,	a	face	,	a	designed	object	--	how	do	we	tell	that	something	is	beautiful	?	And	why	does	it	matter	so	much	to	us	?	Designer	Richard	Seymour	 explore 	 s 	 	our	response	to	beauty	and	the	 surpris 	 ing 	 	power	of	objects	that	exhibit	it	.

Richard	Seymour	:	How	beauty	 feel 	 s 	 
When	I	was	little	--	and	by	the	way	,	I	was	little	once	--	my	father	told	me	a	story	about	an	18th	century	 watch 	 maker 	 	.
And	what	this	guy	had	done	:	he	used	to	produce	these	 fabulous 	 ly 	 	beautiful	watches	.
And	one	day	,	one	of	his	customers	came	into	his	workshop	and	asked	him	to	clean	the	watch	that	he	'd	bought	.
And	the	guy	took	it	apart	,	and	one	of	the	things	he	 pull 	 ed 	 	out	was	one	of	the	balance	wheels	.
And	as	he	did	so	,	his	customer	noticed	that	on	the	back	side	of	the	balance	wheel	was	an	engraving	,	were	words	.
And	he	said	to	the	guy	,	``	Why	have	you	put	stuff	on	the	back	that	no	one	will	ever	see	?	''
And	the	 watch 	 maker 	 	turned	around	and	said	,	``	God	can	see	it	.	''
Now	I	'm	not	in	the	least	bit	religious	,	neither	was	my	father	,	but	at	that	point	,	I	noticed	something	happening	here	.
I	felt	something	in	this	plexus	of	blood	vessels	and	nerves	,	and	there	must	be	some	 muscle 	 s 	 	in	there	as	well	 s 	 omewhere 	 	,	I	guess	.
But	I	felt	something	.
And	it	was	a	physiological	response	.
And	from	that	point	on	,	from	my	age	at	the	time	,	I	began	to	think	of	things	in	a	different	way	.
And	as	I	took	on	my	career	as	a	designer	,	I	began	to	ask	myself	the	simple	question	:	Do	we	actually	think	beauty	,	or	do	we	feel	it	?
Now	you	probably	know	the	answer	to	this	already	.
You	probably	think	,	well	,	I	do	n't	know	which	one	you	think	it	is	,	but	I	think	it	's	about	feeling	beauty	.
And	so	I	then	moved	on	into	my	design	career	and	began	to	find	some	 excit 	 ing 	 	things	.
One	of	the	most	early	work	was	done	in	automotive	design	--	some	very	 excit 	 ing 	 	work	was	done	there	.
And	during	a	lot	of	this	work	,	we	found	something	,	or	I	found	something	,	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 fascin 	 ated 	 	me	,	and	maybe	you	can	remember	it	.
Do	you	remember	when	lights	used	to	just	go	on	and	off	,	click	click	,	when	you	closed	the	door	in	a	car	?
And	then	 some 	 body 	 	,	I	think	it	was	BMW	,	introduced	a	light	that	went	out	 slow 	 ly 	 	.
Remember	that	?
I	remember	it	 clear 	 ly 	 	.
Do	you	remember	the	first	time	you	were	in	a	car	and	it	did	that	?
I	remember	sitting	there	thinking	,	this	is	fantastic	.
In	fact	,	I	've	never	found	 any 	 body 	 	that	does	n't	like	the	light	that	goes	out	 slow 	 ly 	 	.
I	thought	,	well	what	the	hell	's	that	about	?
So	I	started	to	ask	myself	questions	about	it	.
And	the	first	was	,	I	'd	ask	other	people	:	``	Do	you	like	it	?	''	``	Yes	.	''
``	Why	?	''	And	they	'd	say	,	``	Oh	,	it	 feel 	 s 	 	so	natural	,	''	or	,	``	It	's	nice	.	''
I	thought	,	well	that	's	not	good	enough	.
Can	we	cut	down	a	little	bit	further	,	because	,	as	a	designer	,	I	need	the	vocabulary	,	I	need	the	keyboard	,	of	how	this	actually	works	.
And	so	I	did	some	 experiment 	 s 	 	.
And	I	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 re 	 alized 	 	that	there	was	something	that	did	 exact 	 ly 	 	that	--	light	to	dark	in	six	seconds	--	 exact 	 ly 	 	that	.
Do	you	know	what	it	is	?	Anyone	?
You	see	,	 us 	 ing 	 	this	bit	,	the	 think 	 y 	 	bit	,	the	slow	bit	of	the	brain	--	 us 	 ing 	 	that	.
And	this	is	n't	a	think	,	it	's	a	feel	.
And	would	you	do	me	a	favor	?
For	the	next	14	minutes	or	whatever	it	is	,	will	you	feel	stuff	?
I	do	n't	need	you	to	think	so	much	as	I	want	you	to	feel	it	.
I	felt	a	sense	of	relaxation	tempered	with	 anticipat 	 ion 	 	.
And	that	thing	that	I	found	was	the	cinema	or	the	theater	.
It	's	actually	just	happened	here	--	light	to	dark	in	six	seconds	.
And	when	that	 happen 	 s 	 	,	are	you	sitting	there	going	,	``	No	,	the	movie	's	about	to	start	,	''	or	are	you	going	,	``	That	's	fantastic	.	I	'm	looking	forward	to	it	.
I	get	a	sense	of	 anticipat 	 ion 	 	''	?
Now	I	'm	not	a	 neuro 	 scientist 	 	.
I	do	n't	know	even	if	there	is	something	called	a	conditioned	reflex	.
But	it	might	be	.
Because	the	people	I	speak	to	in	the	northern	 hemi 	 sphere 	 	that	used	to	go	in	the	cinema	get	this	.
And	some	of	the	people	I	speak	to	that	have	never	seen	a	movie	or	been	to	the	theater	do	n't	get	it	in	the	same	way	.
Everybody	 like 	 s 	 	it	,	but	some	like	it	more	than	others	.
So	this	leads	me	to	think	of	this	in	a	different	way	.
We	're	not	feeling	it	.	We	're	thinking	beauty	is	in	the	limbic	system	--	if	that	's	not	an	 out 	 moded 	 	idea	.
These	are	the	bits	,	the	pleasure	centers	,	and	maybe	what	I	'm	seeing	and	sensing	and	feeling	is	 bypass 	 ing 	 	my	thinking	.
The	wiring	from	your	sensory	apparatus	to	those	bits	is	 short 	 er 	 	than	the	bits	that	have	to	pass	through	the	 think 	 y 	 	bit	,	the	cortex	.
They	arrive	first	.
So	how	do	we	make	that	actually	work	?
And	how	much	of	that	reactive	side	of	it	is	due	to	what	we	already	know	,	or	what	we	're	going	to	learn	,	about	something	?
This	is	one	of	the	most	beautiful	things	I	know	.
It	's	a	plastic	bag	.
And	when	I	looked	at	it	first	,	I	thought	,	no	,	there	's	no	beauty	in	that	.
Then	I	found	out	,	post	exposure	,	that	this	plastic	bag	if	I	put	it	into	a	filthy	puddle	or	a	stream	filled	with	 col 	 iforms 	 	and	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 disgust 	 ing 	 	stuff	,	that	that	filthy	water	will	migrate	through	the	wall	of	the	bag	by	osmosis	and	end	up	inside	it	as	pure	,	potable	drinking	water	.
And	all	of	a	sudden	,	this	plastic	bag	was	 extreme 	 ly 	 	beautiful	to	me	.
Now	I	'm	going	to	ask	you	again	to	switch	on	the	emotional	bit	.
Would	you	mind	taking	the	brain	out	,	and	I	just	want	you	to	feel	something	.
Look	at	that	.	What	are	you	feeling	about	it	?
Is	it	beautiful	?	Is	it	 excit 	 ing 	 	?
I	'm	watching	your	faces	very	 care 	 fully 	 	.
There	's	some	rather	 bored 	 - 	 looking 	 	 gentle 	 men 	 	and	some	 s 	 lightly 	 	 engaged 	 - 	 looking 	 	ladies	who	are	picking	up	something	off	that	.
Maybe	there	's	an	innocence	to	it	.
Now	I	'm	going	to	tell	you	what	it	is	.	Are	you	ready	?
This	is	the	last	act	on	this	Earth	of	a	little	girl	called	Heidi	,	five	years	old	,	before	she	died	of	cancer	to	the	spine	.
It	's	the	last	thing	she	did	,	the	last	physical	act	.
Look	at	that	picture	.
Look	at	the	innocence	.	Look	at	the	beauty	in	it	.
Is	it	beautiful	now	?
Stop	.	Stop	.	How	do	you	feel	?
Where	are	you	feeling	this	?
I	'm	feeling	it	here	.	I	feel	it	here	.
And	I	'm	watching	your	faces	,	because	your	faces	are	telling	me	something	.
The	lady	over	there	is	actually	crying	,	by	the	way	.
But	what	are	you	 do 	 ing 	 	?
I	watch	what	people	do	.
I	watch	faces	.
I	watch	reactions	.
Because	I	have	to	know	how	people	react	to	things	.
And	one	of	the	most	common	faces	on	something	faced	with	beauty	,	something	 stupefy 	 ingly 	 	delicious	,	is	what	I	call	the	OMG	.
And	by	the	way	,	there	's	no	pleasure	in	that	face	.
It	's	not	a	``	this	is	wonderful	!	''
The	 eyebrow 	 s 	 	are	 do 	 ing 	 	this	,	the	eyes	are	 defocus 	 ed 	 	,	and	the	mouth	is	hanging	open	.
That	's	not	the	expression	of	joy	.
There	's	something	else	in	that	.
There	's	something	weird	happening	.
So	pleasure	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	tempered	by	a	whole	series	of	different	things	coming	in	.
 Poig 	 nancy 	 	is	a	word	I	love	as	a	designer	.
It	means	something	 trigger 	 ing 	 	a	big	emotional	response	,	often	quite	a	sad	emotional	response	,	but	it	's	part	of	what	we	do	.
It	is	n't	just	about	nice	.
And	this	is	the	dilemma	,	this	is	the	paradox	,	of	beauty	.
 Sensor 	 ily 	 	,	we	're	taking	in	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	things	--	 mixture 	 s 	 	of	things	that	are	good	,	bad	,	 excit 	 ing 	 	,	 frighten 	 ing 	 	--	to	come	up	with	that	sensorial	exposure	,	that	sensation	of	what	's	going	on	.
 Patho 	 s 	 	appears	 obvious 	 ly 	 	as	part	of	what	you	just	saw	in	that	little	girl	's	drawing	.
And	also	triumph	,	this	sense	of	 transcend 	 ence 	 	,	this	``	I	never	knew	that	.	Ah	,	this	is	something	new	.	''
And	that	's	packed	in	there	as	well	.
And	as	we	assemble	these	tools	,	from	a	design	point	of	view	,	I	get	 terri 	 bly 	 	excited	about	it	,	because	these	are	things	,	as	we	've	already	said	,	they	're	 arriv 	 ing 	 	at	the	brain	,	it	would	seem	,	before	cognition	,	before	we	can	 manipulat 	 e 	 	them	--	 electro 	 chemical 	 	party	tricks	.
Now	what	I	'm	also	interested	in	is	:	Is	it	possible	to	separate	intrinsic	and	extrinsic	beauty	?
By	that	,	I	mean	 intrinsic 	 ally 	 	beautiful	things	,	just	something	that	's	 ex 	 quisitely 	 	beautiful	,	that	's	 universal 	 ly 	 	beautiful	.
Very	hard	to	find	.	Maybe	you	've	got	some	examples	of	it	.
Very	hard	to	find	something	that	,	to	everybody	,	is	a	very	beautiful	thing	,	without	a	certain	amount	of	information	packed	in	there	before	.
So	a	lot	of	it	 tend 	 s 	 	to	be	extrinsic	.
It	's	mediated	by	information	before	the	comprehension	.
Or	the	information	's	added	on	at	the	back	,	like	that	little	girl	's	drawing	that	I	 show 	 ed 	 	you	.
Now	when	talking	about	beauty	you	ca	n't	get	away	from	the	fact	that	a	lot	 experiment 	 s 	 	have	been	done	in	this	way	with	faces	and	what	have	you	.
And	one	of	the	most	 ted 	 ious 	 	ones	,	I	think	,	was	saying	that	beauty	was	about	symmetry	.
Well	it	 obvious 	 ly 	 	is	n't	.
This	is	a	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	one	where	half	faces	were	shown	to	some	people	,	and	then	to	add	them	into	a	list	of	most	beautiful	to	least	beautiful	and	then	 expos 	 ing 	 	a	full	face	.
And	they	found	that	it	was	almost	exact	 co 	 incidence 	 	.
So	it	was	n't	about	symmetry	.
In	fact	,	this	lady	has	a	 particular 	 ly 	 	 a 	 symmetrical 	 	face	,	of	which	both	sides	are	beautiful	.
But	they	're	both	different	.
And	as	a	designer	,	I	ca	n't	help	 medd 	 ling 	 	with	this	,	so	I	 pull 	 ed 	 	it	to	bits	and	sort	of	did	stuff	like	this	,	and	tried	to	understand	what	the	individual	elements	were	,	but	feeling	it	as	I	go	.
Now	I	can	feel	a	sensation	of	delight	and	beauty	if	I	look	at	that	eye	.
I	'm	not	getting	it	off	the	eyebrow	.
And	the	 ear 	 hole 	 	is	n't	 do 	 ing 	 	it	to	me	at	all	.
So	I	do	n't	know	how	much	this	is	 help 	 ing 	 	me	,	but	it	's	 help 	 ing 	 	to	guide	me	to	the	places	where	the	signals	are	coming	off	.
And	as	I	say	,	I	'm	not	a	 neuro 	 scientist 	 	,	but	to	understand	how	I	can	start	to	assemble	things	that	will	very	quickly	bypass	this	thinking	part	and	get	me	to	the	 enjoy 	 able 	 	 pre 	 cognitive 	 	elements	.
 Ana 	 is 	 	Nin	and	the	Talmud	have	told	us	time	and	time	again	that	we	see	things	not	as	they	are	,	but	as	we	are	.
So	I	'm	going	to	 shameless 	 ly 	 	expose	something	to	you	,	which	is	beautiful	to	me	.
And	this	is	the	F1	MV	Agusta	.
 A 	 hhhh 	 	.
It	is	 re 	 ally 	 	--	I	mean	,	I	ca	n't	express	to	you	how	 exquisit 	 e 	 	this	object	is	.
But	I	also	know	why	it	's	 exquisit 	 e 	 	to	me	,	because	it	's	a	palimpsest	of	things	.
It	's	masses	and	masses	of	layers	.
This	is	just	the	bit	that	 protrud 	 es 	 	into	our	physical	dimension	.
It	's	something	much	 bigg 	 er 	 	.
Layer	after	layer	of	legend	,	sport	,	details	that	 resonat 	 e 	 	.
I	mean	,	if	I	just	go	through	some	of	them	now	--	I	know	about	laminar	flow	when	it	comes	to	 air 	 - 	 piercing 	 	objects	,	and	that	does	it	 consummate 	 ly 	 	well	,	you	can	see	it	can	.
So	that	's	getting	me	excited	.
And	I	feel	that	here	.
This	bit	,	the	big	secret	of	automotive	design	--	reflection	management	.
It	's	not	about	the	shapes	,	it	's	how	the	shapes	reflect	light	.
Now	that	thing	,	light	 flicker 	 s 	 	across	it	as	you	move	,	so	it	becomes	a	kinetic	object	,	even	though	it	's	standing	still	--	managed	by	how	 brilliant 	 ly 	 	that	's	done	on	the	reflection	.
This	little	relief	on	the	 foot 	 plate 	 	,	by	the	way	,	to	a	rider	means	there	's	something	going	on	 u 	 nderneath 	 	it	--	in	this	case	,	a	drive	chain	running	at	300	miles	and	hour	probably	,	taking	the	power	from	the	engine	.
I	'm	getting	 terri 	 bly 	 	excited	as	my	mind	and	my	eyes	flick	across	these	things	.
Titanium	lacquer	on	this	.
I	ca	n't	tell	you	how	wonderful	this	is	.
That	's	how	you	stop	the	nuts	coming	off	at	high	speed	on	the	wheel	.
I	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	getting	into	this	now	.
And	of	course	,	a	racing	bike	does	n't	have	a	prop	stand	,	but	this	one	,	because	it	's	a	road	bike	,	it	all	goes	away	and	it	folds	into	this	little	gap	.
So	it	 disappear 	 s 	 	.
And	then	I	ca	n't	tell	you	how	hard	it	is	to	do	that	radiator	,	which	is	curved	.
Why	would	you	do	that	?
Because	I	know	we	need	to	bring	the	wheel	farther	into	the	 aerodynamic 	 s 	 	.
So	it	's	more	expensive	,	but	it	's	wonderful	.
And	to	cap	it	all	,	brand	royalty	--	Agusta	,	Count	Agusta	,	from	the	great	 historie 	 s 	 	of	this	stuff	.
The	bit	that	you	ca	n't	see	is	the	genius	that	created	this	.
Massimo	 Tambur 	 ini 	 	.
They	call	him	``	The	 Plumb 	 er 	 	''	in	Italy	,	as	well	as	``	Maestro	,	''	because	he	actually	is	engineer	and	craftsman	and	sculptor	at	the	same	time	.
There	's	so	little	compromise	on	this	,	you	ca	n't	see	it	.
But	 unfortunat 	 ely 	 	,	the	 like 	 s 	 	of	me	and	people	that	are	like	me	have	to	deal	with	compromise	all	the	time	with	beauty	.
We	have	to	deal	with	it	.
So	I	have	to	work	with	a	supply	chain	,	and	I	've	got	to	work	with	the	technologies	,	and	I	've	got	to	work	with	everything	else	all	the	time	,	and	so	 compromise 	 s 	 	start	to	fit	into	it	.
And	so	look	at	her	.
I	've	had	to	make	a	bit	of	a	compromise	there	.
I	've	had	to	move	that	part	across	,	but	only	a	millimeter	.
No	one	's	noticed	,	have	they	yet	?
Did	you	see	what	I	did	?
I	moved	three	things	by	a	millimeter	.
Pretty	?	Yes	.
Beautiful	?	Maybe	 less 	 er 	 	.
But	then	,	of	course	,	the	consumer	says	that	does	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	matter	.
So	that	's	okay	,	is	n't	it	?
Another	millimeter	?
No	one	's	going	to	notice	those	split	lines	and	changes	.
It	's	that	easy	to	lose	beauty	,	because	beauty	's	 incredibl 	 y 	 	difficult	to	do	.
And	only	a	few	people	can	do	it	.
And	a	focus	group	can	not	do	it	.
And	a	team	 rare 	 ly 	 	can	do	it	.
It	takes	a	central	cortex	,	if	you	like	,	to	be	able	to	 orchestra 	 te 	 	all	those	elements	at	the	same	time	.
This	is	a	beautiful	water	bottle	--	some	of	you	know	of	it	--	done	by	Ross	 Love 	 grove 	 	,	the	designer	.
This	is	pretty	close	to	intrinsic	beauty	.	This	one	,	as	long	as	you	know	what	water	is	like	then	you	can	experience	this	.
It	's	 love 	 ly 	 	because	it	is	an	embodiment	of	something	 refresh 	 ing 	 	and	delicious	.
I	might	like	it	more	than	you	like	it	,	because	I	know	how	 blood 	 y 	 	hard	it	is	to	do	it	.
It	's	 stupefy 	 ingly 	 	difficult	to	make	something	that	 refract 	 s 	 	light	like	that	,	that	comes	out	of	the	tool	 correct 	 ly 	 	,	that	goes	down	the	line	without	 fall 	 ing 	 	over	.
 U 	 nderneath 	 	this	,	like	the	story	of	the	swan	,	is	a	million	things	very	difficult	to	do	.
So	all	hail	to	that	.
It	's	a	fantastic	example	,	a	simple	object	.
And	the	one	I	 show 	 ed 	 	you	before	was	,	of	course	,	a	 massive 	 ly 	 	complex	one	.
And	they	're	working	in	beauty	in	 s 	 lightly 	 	different	ways	because	of	it	.
You	all	,	I	guess	,	like	me	,	enjoy	watching	a	ballet	dancer	dance	.
And	part	of	the	joy	of	it	is	,	you	know	the	 difficult 	 y 	 	.
You	also	may	be	taking	into	account	the	fact	that	it	's	 incredibl 	 y 	 	 pain 	 ful 	 	.
 Any 	 body 	 	seen	a	ballet	dancer	's	toes	when	they	come	out	of	the	points	?
While	she	's	 do 	 ing 	 	these	graceful	 arabes 	 ques 	 	and	plies	and	what	have	you	,	something	 h 	 orrible 	 	's	going	on	down	here	.
The	comprehension	of	it	leads	us	to	a	greater	and	 heighten 	 ed 	 	sense	of	the	beauty	of	what	's	actually	going	on	.
Now	I	'm	 us 	 ing 	 	 micro 	 seconds 	 	 wrong 	 ly 	 	here	,	so	please	ignore	me	.
But	what	I	have	to	do	now	,	feeling	again	,	what	I	've	got	to	do	is	to	be	able	to	supply	enough	of	these	enzymes	,	of	these	 trigger 	 s 	 	into	something	early	on	in	the	process	,	that	you	pick	it	up	,	not	through	your	thinking	,	but	through	your	feeling	.
So	we	're	going	to	have	a	little	experiment	.
Right	,	are	you	ready	?	I	'm	going	to	show	you	something	for	a	very	,	very	brief	moment	.
Are	you	ready	?	Okay	.
Did	you	think	that	was	a	bicycle	when	I	 show 	 ed 	 	it	to	you	at	the	first	flash	?
It	's	not	.
Tell	me	something	,	did	you	think	it	was	quick	when	you	first	saw	it	?	Yes	you	did	.
Did	you	think	it	was	modern	?	Yes	you	did	.
That	blip	,	that	information	,	shot	into	you	before	that	.
And	because	your	brain	starter	motor	began	there	,	now	it	's	got	to	deal	with	it	.
And	the	great	thing	is	,	this	motorcycle	has	been	styled	this	way	 s 	 pecifically 	 	to	 en 	 gender 	 	a	sense	that	it	's	green	technology	and	it	's	good	for	you	and	it	's	light	and	it	's	all	part	of	the	future	.
So	is	that	wrong	?
Well	in	this	case	it	is	n't	,	because	it	's	a	very	,	very	 eco 	 logically 	 - 	 sound 	 	piece	of	technology	.
But	you	're	a	slave	of	that	first	flash	.
We	are	slaves	to	the	first	few	 fraction 	 s 	 	of	a	second	--	and	that	's	where	much	of	my	work	has	to	win	or	lose	,	on	a	shelf	in	a	shop	.
It	wins	or	 lose 	 s 	 	at	that	point	.
You	may	see	50	,	100	,	200	things	on	a	shelf	as	you	walk	down	it	,	but	I	have	to	work	within	that	domain	,	to	ensure	that	it	 get 	 s 	 	you	there	first	.
And	finally	,	the	layer	that	I	love	,	of	knowledge	.
Some	of	you	,	I	'm	sure	,	will	be	familiar	with	this	.
What	's	 incredibl 	 e 	 	about	this	,	and	the	way	I	love	to	come	back	to	it	,	is	this	is	taking	something	that	you	hate	or	bores	you	,	folding	clothes	,	and	if	you	can	actually	do	this	--	who	can	actually	do	this	?	 Any 	 body 	 	try	to	do	this	?
Yeah	?
It	's	fantastic	,	is	n't	it	?
Look	at	that	.	Do	you	want	to	see	it	again	?
No	time	.	It	says	I	have	two	minutes	left	,	so	we	ca	n't	do	this	.
But	just	go	to	the	Web	,	YouTube	,	pull	it	down	,	``	folding	 T 	 - 	 shirt 	 	.	''
That	's	how	 under 	 paid 	 	 younger 	 - 	 aged 	 	people	have	to	fold	your	 T 	 - 	 shirt 	 	.
You	did	n't	maybe	know	it	.
But	how	do	you	feel	about	it	?
It	 feel 	 s 	 	fantastic	when	you	do	it	,	you	look	forward	to	 do 	 ing 	 	it	,	and	when	you	tell	 some 	 body 	 	else	about	it	--	like	you	probably	have	--	you	look	 re 	 ally 	 	smart	.
The	knowledge	bubble	that	sits	around	the	outside	,	the	stuff	that	costs	nothing	,	because	that	knowledge	is	free	--	bundle	that	together	and	where	do	we	come	out	?
Form	follows	function	?
Only	sometimes	.	Only	sometimes	.
Form	is	function	.	Form	is	function	.
It	 inform 	 s 	 	,	it	 tell 	 s 	 	us	,	it	supplies	us	answers	before	we	've	even	thought	about	it	.
And	so	I	've	stopped	 us 	 ing 	 	words	like	``	form	,	''	and	I	've	stopped	 us 	 ing 	 	words	like	``	function	''	as	a	designer	.
What	I	try	to	pursue	now	is	the	emotional	functionality	of	things	.
Because	if	I	can	get	that	right	,	I	can	make	them	wonderful	,	and	I	can	make	them	 repeated 	 ly 	 	wonderful	.
And	you	know	what	those	products	and	services	are	,	because	you	own	some	of	them	.
They	're	the	things	that	you	'd	snatch	if	the	house	was	on	fire	.
 Form 	 ing 	 	the	emotional	bond	between	this	thing	and	you	is	an	 electro 	 chemical 	 	party	trick	that	 happen 	 s 	 	before	you	even	think	about	it	.
Thank	you	very	much	.

 a 	 theism 	 	,	culture	,	philosophy	,	religion

Alain	de	Botton	:	Atheism	2.0
One	of	the	most	common	ways	of	dividing	the	world	is	into	those	who	believe	and	those	who	do	n't	--	into	the	religious	and	the	 atheist 	 s 	 	.
And	for	the	last	decade	or	so	,	it	's	been	quite	clear	what	being	an	atheist	means	.
There	have	been	some	very	vocal	 atheist 	 s 	 	who	've	pointed	out	,	not	just	that	religion	is	wrong	,	but	that	it	's	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	.
These	people	,	many	of	whom	have	lived	in	North	Oxford	,	have	argued	--	they	've	argued	that	believing	in	God	is	 a 	 kin 	 	to	believing	in	fairies	and	 essential 	 ly 	 	that	the	whole	thing	is	a	 child 	 ish 	 	game	.
Now	I	think	it	's	too	easy	.
I	think	it	's	too	easy	to	dismiss	the	whole	of	religion	that	way	.
And	it	's	as	easy	as	shooting	fish	in	a	barrel	.
And	what	I	'd	like	to	 inaugurat 	 e 	 	today	is	a	new	way	of	being	an	atheist	--	if	you	like	,	a	new	version	of	 a 	 theism 	 	we	could	call	Atheism	2.0	.
Now	what	is	Atheism	2.0	?
Well	it	starts	from	a	very	basic	premise	:	of	course	,	there	's	no	God	.
Of	course	,	there	are	no	 de 	 ities 	 	or	supernatural	 spirit 	 s 	 	or	angels	,	etc	.
Now	let	's	move	on	;	that	's	not	the	end	of	the	story	,	that	's	the	very	,	very	beginning	.
I	'm	interested	in	the	kind	of	constituency	that	 think 	 s 	 	something	along	these	lines	:	that	 think 	 s 	 	,	``	I	ca	n't	believe	in	any	of	this	stuff	.
I	ca	n't	believe	in	the	 doctrine 	 s 	 	.
I	do	n't	think	these	 doctrine 	 s 	 	are	right	.
But	,	''	a	very	important	but	,	``	I	love	Christmas	 carol 	 s 	 	.
I	 re 	 ally 	 	like	the	art	of	Mantegna	.
I	 re 	 ally 	 	like	looking	at	old	churches	.
I	 re 	 ally 	 	like	turning	the	pages	of	the	Old	Testament	.	''
Whatever	it	may	be	,	you	know	the	kind	of	thing	I	'm	talking	about	--	people	who	are	 attract 	 ed 	 	to	the	 ritual 	 istic 	 	side	,	the	 moral 	 istic 	 	,	communal	side	of	religion	,	but	ca	n't	bear	the	doctrine	.
Until	now	,	these	people	have	faced	a	rather	unpleasant	choice	.
It	's	almost	as	though	either	you	accept	the	doctrine	and	then	you	can	have	all	the	nice	stuff	,	or	you	reject	the	doctrine	and	you	're	living	in	some	kind	of	spiritual	 waste 	 land 	 	under	the	guidance	of	CNN	and	Walmart	.
So	that	's	a	sort	of	tough	choice	.
I	do	n't	think	we	have	to	make	that	choice	.
I	think	there	is	an	alternative	.
I	think	there	are	ways	--	and	I	'm	being	both	very	respectful	and	 complete 	 ly 	 	 impi 	 ous 	 	--	of	stealing	from	religions	.
If	you	do	n't	believe	in	a	religion	,	there	's	nothing	wrong	with	picking	and	mixing	,	with	taking	out	the	best	sides	of	religion	.
And	for	me	,	 a 	 theism 	 	2.0	is	about	both	,	as	I	say	,	a	respectful	and	an	 impi 	 ous 	 	way	of	going	through	religions	and	saying	,	``	What	here	could	we	use	?	''
The	secular	world	is	full	of	holes	.
We	have	 secularize 	 d 	 	 bad 	 ly 	 	,	I	would	argue	.
And	a	thorough	study	of	religion	could	give	us	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 insight 	 s 	 	into	areas	of	life	that	are	not	going	too	well	.
And	I	'd	like	to	run	through	a	few	of	these	today	.
I	'd	like	to	kick	off	by	looking	at	education	.
Now	education	is	a	field	the	secular	world	 re 	 ally 	 	 believe 	 s 	 	in	.
When	we	think	about	how	we	're	going	to	make	the	world	a	better	place	,	we	think	education	;	that	's	where	we	put	a	lot	of	money	.
Education	is	going	to	give	us	,	not	only	commercial	skills	,	industrial	skills	,	it	's	also	going	to	make	us	better	people	.
You	know	the	kind	of	thing	a	commencement	address	is	,	and	graduation	 ceremonie 	 s 	 	,	those	 ly 	 rical 	 	claims	that	education	,	the	process	of	education	--	 particular 	 ly 	 	higher	education	--	will	make	us	into	 noble 	 r 	 	and	better	human	beings	.
That	's	a	 love 	 ly 	 	idea	.
Interesting	where	it	came	from	.
In	the	early	19th	century	,	church	attendance	in	Western	Europe	started	sliding	down	very	,	very	 sharp 	 ly 	 	,	and	people	 pani 	 cked 	 	.
They	asked	themselves	the	following	question	.
They	said	,	where	are	people	going	to	find	the	morality	,	where	are	they	going	to	find	guidance	,	and	where	are	they	going	to	find	sources	of	 consol 	 ation 	 	?
And	 i 	 nfluential 	 	voices	came	up	with	one	answer	.
They	said	culture	.
It	's	to	culture	that	we	should	look	for	guidance	,	for	 consol 	 ation 	 	,	for	morality	.
Let	's	look	to	the	plays	of	Shakespeare	,	the	 dialogue 	 s 	 	of	Plato	,	the	novels	of	Jane	Austen	.
In	there	,	we	'll	find	a	lot	of	the	 truth 	 s 	 	that	we	might	 previousl 	 y 	 	have	found	in	the	Gospel	of	Saint	John	.
Now	I	think	that	's	a	very	beautiful	idea	and	a	very	true	idea	.
They	wanted	to	replace	scripture	with	culture	.
And	that	's	a	very	 plausib 	 le 	 	idea	.
It	's	also	an	idea	that	we	have	forgotten	.
If	you	went	to	a	top	university	--	let	's	say	you	went	to	Harvard	or	Oxford	or	Cambridge	--	and	you	said	,	``	I	've	come	here	because	I	'm	in	search	of	morality	,	guidance	and	 consol 	 ation 	 	;	I	want	to	know	how	to	live	,	''	they	would	show	you	the	way	to	the	insane	asylum	.
This	is	simply	not	what	our	 grand 	 est 	 	and	best	institutes	of	higher	learning	are	in	the	business	of	.
Why	?	They	do	n't	think	we	need	it	.
They	do	n't	think	we	are	in	an	urgent	need	of	assistance	.
They	see	us	as	adults	,	rational	adults	.
What	we	need	is	information	.
We	need	data	,	we	do	n't	need	help	.
Now	religions	start	from	a	very	different	place	 inde 	 ed 	 	.
All	religions	,	all	major	religions	,	at	various	points	call	us	children	.
And	like	children	,	they	believe	that	we	are	in	severe	need	of	assistance	.
We	're	only	just	holding	it	together	.
Perhaps	this	is	just	me	,	maybe	you	.
But	 any 	 way 	 	,	we	're	only	just	holding	it	together	.
And	we	need	help	.	Of	course	,	we	need	help	.
And	so	we	need	guidance	and	we	need	didactic	learning	.
You	know	,	in	the	18th	century	in	the	U.K.	,	the	greatest	preacher	,	greatest	religious	preacher	,	was	a	man	called	John	Wesley	,	who	went	up	and	down	this	country	 deliver 	 ing 	 	 sermon 	 s 	 	,	 advis 	 ing 	 	people	how	they	could	live	.
He	delivered	 sermon 	 s 	 	on	the	duties	of	parents	to	their	children	and	children	to	their	parents	,	the	duties	of	the	rich	to	the	poor	and	the	poor	to	the	rich	.
He	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	tell	people	how	they	should	live	through	the	medium	of	 sermon 	 s 	 	,	the	classic	medium	of	delivery	of	religions	.
Now	we	've	given	up	with	the	idea	of	 sermon 	 s 	 	.
If	you	said	to	a	modern	liberal	 individual 	 ist 	 	,	``	Hey	,	how	about	a	sermon	?	''
they	'd	go	,	``	No	,	no	.	I	do	n't	need	one	of	those	.
I	'm	an	independent	,	individual	person	.	''
What	's	the	difference	between	a	sermon	and	our	modern	,	secular	mode	of	delivery	,	the	lecture	?
Well	a	sermon	 want 	 s 	 	to	change	your	life	and	a	lecture	 want 	 s 	 	to	give	you	a	bit	of	information	.
And	I	think	we	need	to	get	back	to	that	sermon	tradition	.
The	tradition	of	 sermon 	 izing 	 	is	 hugel 	 y 	 	valuable	,	because	we	are	in	need	of	guidance	,	morality	and	 consol 	 ation 	 	--	and	religions	know	that	.
Another	point	about	education	:	we	tend	to	believe	in	the	modern	secular	world	that	if	you	tell	someone	something	once	,	they	'll	remember	it	.
Sit	them	in	a	classroom	,	tell	them	about	Plato	at	the	age	of	20	,	send	them	out	for	a	career	in	management	 consultanc 	 y 	 	for	40	years	,	and	that	lesson	will	stick	with	them	.
Religions	go	,	``	 Non 	 sense 	 	.
You	need	to	keep	 repeat 	 ing 	 	the	lesson	10	times	a	day	.
So	get	on	your	 knee 	 s 	 	and	repeat	it	.	''
That	's	what	all	religions	tell	us	:	``	Get	on	you	 knee 	 s 	 	and	repeat	it	10	or	20	or	15	times	a	day	.	''
Otherwise	our	minds	are	like	 sieve 	 s 	 	.
So	religions	are	cultures	of	 re 	 petition 	 	.
They	circle	the	great	 truth 	 s 	 	again	and	again	and	again	.
We	associate	 re 	 petition 	 	with	boredom	.
``	Give	us	the	new	,	''	we	're	always	saying	.
``	The	new	is	better	than	the	old	.	''
If	I	said	to	you	,	``	Okay	,	we	're	not	going	to	have	new	TED	.
We	're	just	going	to	run	through	all	the	old	ones	and	watch	them	five	times	because	they	're	so	true	.
We	're	going	to	watch	Elizabeth	Gilbert	five	times	because	what	she	says	is	so	clever	,	''	you	'd	feel	 che 	 ated 	 	.
Not	so	if	you	're	 adopt 	 ing 	 	a	religious	 mind 	 set 	 	.
The	other	things	that	religions	do	is	to	arrange	time	.
All	the	major	religions	give	us	 calendar 	 s 	 	.
What	is	a	calendar	?
A	calendar	is	a	way	of	making	sure	that	across	the	year	you	will	bump	into	certain	very	important	ideas	.
In	the	Catholic	chronology	,	Catholic	calendar	,	at	the	end	of	March	you	will	think	about	St.	Jerome	and	his	qualities	of	 humil 	 ity 	 	and	goodness	and	his	 generos 	 ity 	 	to	the	poor	.
You	wo	n't	do	that	by	accident	;	you	will	do	that	because	you	are	guided	to	do	that	.
Now	we	do	n't	think	that	way	.
In	the	secular	world	we	think	,	``	If	an	idea	is	important	,	I	'll	bump	into	it	.
I	'll	just	come	across	it	.	''
 Non 	 sense 	 	,	says	the	religious	world	view	.
Religious	view	says	we	need	 calendar 	 s 	 	,	we	need	to	structure	time	,	we	need	to	synchronize	 encounter 	 s 	 	.
This	comes	across	also	in	the	way	in	which	religions	set	up	 ritual 	 s 	 	around	important	 feeling 	 s 	 	.
Take	the	Moon	.	It	's	 re 	 ally 	 	important	to	look	at	the	Moon	.
You	know	,	when	you	look	at	the	Moon	,	you	think	,	``	I	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	small	.	What	are	my	problems	?	''
It	sets	things	into	perspective	,	 et 	 c. 	 	,	etc	.
We	should	all	look	at	the	Moon	a	bit	more	often	.	We	do	n't	.
Why	do	n't	we	?	Well	there	's	nothing	to	tell	us	,	``	Look	at	the	Moon	.	''
But	if	you	're	a	Zen	Buddhist	in	the	middle	of	September	,	you	will	be	ordered	out	of	your	home	,	made	to	stand	on	a	canonical	platform	and	made	to	 celebrat 	 e 	 	the	festival	of	 Tsuki 	 mi 	 	,	where	you	will	be	given	poems	to	read	in	honor	of	the	Moon	and	the	passage	of	time	and	the	 frail 	 ty 	 	of	life	that	it	should	 re 	 mind 	 	us	of	.
You	'll	be	handed	rice	cakes	.
And	the	Moon	and	the	reflection	on	the	Moon	will	have	a	secure	place	in	your	heart	.
That	's	very	good	.
The	other	thing	that	religions	are	 re 	 ally 	 	aware	of	is	:	speak	well	--	I	'm	not	 do 	 ing 	 	a	very	good	job	of	this	here	--	but	oratory	,	oratory	is	 absolute 	 ly 	 	key	to	religions	.
In	the	secular	world	,	you	can	come	through	the	university	system	and	be	a	 lous 	 y 	 	speaker	and	still	have	a	great	career	.
But	the	religious	world	does	n't	think	that	way	.
What	you	're	saying	needs	to	be	backed	up	by	a	 re 	 ally 	 	convincing	way	of	saying	it	.
So	if	you	go	to	an	African	American	 Pentecost 	 alist 	 	church	in	the	American	South	and	you	listen	to	how	they	talk	,	my	goodness	,	they	talk	well	.
After	every	convincing	point	,	people	will	go	,	``	Amen	,	 a 	 men 	 	,	 a 	 men 	 	.	''
At	the	end	of	a	 re 	 ally 	 	rousing	paragraph	,	they	'll	all	stand	up	,	and	they	'll	go	,	``	Thank	you	Jesus	,	thank	you	Christ	,	thank	you	Savior	.	''
If	we	were	 do 	 ing 	 	it	like	they	do	it	--	let	's	not	do	it	,	but	if	we	were	to	do	it	--	I	would	tell	you	something	like	,	``	Culture	should	replace	scripture	.	''
And	you	would	go	,	``	Amen	,	 a 	 men 	 	,	 a 	 men 	 	.	''
And	at	the	end	of	my	talk	,	you	would	all	stand	up	and	you	would	go	,	``	Thank	you	Plato	,	thank	you	Shakespeare	,	thank	you	Jane	Austen	.	''
And	we	'd	know	that	we	had	a	real	rhythm	going	.
All	right	,	all	right	.	We	're	getting	there	.	We	're	getting	there	.
The	other	thing	that	religions	know	is	we	're	not	just	brains	,	we	are	also	bodies	.
And	when	they	teach	us	a	lesson	,	they	do	it	via	the	body	.
So	for	example	,	take	the	Jewish	idea	of	 forgive 	 ness 	 	.
Jews	are	very	interested	in	 forgive 	 ness 	 	and	how	we	should	start	 a 	 new 	 	and	start	 a 	 fresh 	 	.
They	do	n't	just	deliver	us	 sermon 	 s 	 	on	this	.
They	do	n't	just	give	us	books	or	words	about	this	.
They	tell	us	to	have	a	bath	.
So	in	Orthodox	Jewish	communities	,	every	Friday	you	go	to	a	 Mik 	 veh 	 	.
You	 immers 	 e 	 	yourself	in	the	water	,	and	a	physical	action	backs	up	a	philosophical	idea	.
We	do	n't	tend	to	do	that	.
Our	ideas	are	in	one	area	and	our	behavior	with	our	bodies	is	in	another	.
Religions	are	 fascina 	 ting 	 	in	the	way	they	try	and	 combin 	 e 	 	the	two	.
Let	's	look	at	art	now	.
Now	art	is	something	that	in	the	secular	world	,	we	think	very	highly	of	.	We	think	art	is	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	important	.
A	lot	of	our	surplus	wealth	goes	to	 museum 	 s 	 	,	etc	.
We	sometimes	hear	it	said	that	 museum 	 s 	 	are	our	new	 cathedral 	 s 	 	,	or	our	new	churches	.
You	've	heard	that	saying	.
Now	I	think	that	the	potential	is	there	,	but	we	've	 complete 	 ly 	 	let	 our 	 selves 	 	down	.
And	the	reason	we	've	let	 our 	 selves 	 	down	is	that	we	're	not	properly	 study 	 ing 	 	how	religions	handle	art	.
The	two	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	ideas	that	are	 hover 	 ing 	 	in	the	modern	world	that	inhibit	our	capacity	to	draw	strength	from	art	:	The	first	idea	is	that	art	should	be	for	art	's	sake	--	a	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	idea	--	an	idea	that	art	should	live	in	a	hermetic	bubble	and	should	not	try	to	do	anything	with	this	troubled	world	.
I	could	n't	disagree	more	.
The	other	thing	that	we	believe	is	that	art	should	n't	explain	itself	,	that	artists	should	n't	say	what	they	're	up	to	,	because	if	they	said	it	,	it	might	destroy	the	spell	and	we	might	find	it	too	easy	.
That	's	why	a	very	common	feeling	when	you	're	in	a	museum	--	let	's	admit	it	--	is	,	``	I	do	n't	know	what	this	is	about	.	''
But	if	we	're	serious	people	,	we	do	n't	admit	to	that	.
But	that	feeling	of	 puzzle 	 ment 	 	is	structural	to	contemporary	art	.
Now	religions	have	a	much	 san 	 er 	 	attitude	to	art	.
They	have	no	trouble	telling	us	what	art	is	about	.
Art	is	about	two	things	in	all	the	major	 faith 	 s 	 	.
 First 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 re 	 mind 	 	you	of	what	there	is	to	love	.
And	 second 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 re 	 mind 	 	you	of	what	there	is	to	fear	and	to	hate	.
And	that	's	what	art	is	.
Art	is	a	visceral	encounter	with	the	most	important	ideas	of	your	faith	.
So	as	you	walk	around	a	church	,	or	a	mosque	or	a	cathedral	,	what	you	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 imbib 	 e 	 	,	what	you	're	 imbib 	 ing 	 	is	,	through	your	eyes	,	through	your	senses	,	 truth 	 s 	 	that	have	otherwise	come	to	you	through	your	mind	.
Essentially	it	's	propaganda	.
Rembrandt	is	a	 propagand 	 ist 	 	in	the	Christian	view	.
Now	the	word	``	propaganda	''	sets	off	alarm	bells	.
We	think	of	Hitler	,	we	think	of	Stalin	.	Do	n't	,	 necessar 	 ily 	 	.
Propaganda	is	a	manner	of	being	didactic	in	honor	of	something	.
And	if	that	thing	is	good	,	there	's	no	problem	with	it	at	all	.
My	view	is	that	 museum 	 s 	 	should	take	a	leaf	out	of	the	book	of	religions	.
And	they	should	make	sure	that	when	you	walk	into	a	museum	--	if	I	was	a	museum	curator	,	I	would	make	a	room	for	love	,	a	room	for	 generos 	 ity 	 	.
All	works	of	art	are	talking	to	us	about	things	.
And	if	we	were	able	to	arrange	spaces	where	we	could	come	across	works	where	we	would	be	told	,	use	these	works	of	art	to	cement	these	ideas	in	your	mind	,	we	would	get	a	lot	more	out	of	art	.
Art	would	pick	up	the	duty	that	it	used	to	have	and	that	we	've	 neglect 	 ed 	 	because	of	certain	 mis 	 - 	 founded 	 	ideas	.
Art	should	be	one	of	the	tools	by	which	we	improve	our	society	.
Art	should	be	didactic	.
Let	's	think	of	something	else	.
The	people	in	the	modern	world	,	in	the	secular	world	,	who	are	interested	in	matters	of	the	spirit	,	in	matters	of	the	mind	,	in	higher	 soul 	 - 	 like 	 	concerns	,	tend	to	be	isolated	 individual 	 s 	 	.
They	're	poets	,	they	're	 philosopher 	 s 	 	,	they	're	 photographer 	 s 	 	,	they	're	 filmmaker 	 s 	 	.
And	they	tend	to	be	on	their	own	.
They	're	our	cottage	industries	.	They	are	vulnerable	,	single	people	.
And	they	get	 depress 	 ed 	 	and	they	get	sad	on	their	own	.
And	they	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	change	much	.
Now	think	about	religions	,	think	about	organized	religions	.
What	do	organized	religions	do	?
They	group	together	,	they	form	institutions	.
And	that	has	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 advantage 	 s 	 	.
First	of	all	,	scale	,	might	.
The	Catholic	Church	 pull 	 ed 	 	in	97	billion	dollars	last	year	according	to	the	Wall	Street	Journal	.
These	are	massive	machines	.
They	're	collaborative	,	they	're	branded	,	they	're	 multi 	 national 	 	,	and	they	're	highly	 discipline 	 d 	 	.
These	are	all	very	good	qualities	.
We	 recogniz 	 e 	 	them	in	relation	to	 corporation 	 s 	 	.
And	 corporation 	 s 	 	are	very	like	religions	in	many	ways	,	except	they	're	right	down	at	the	bottom	of	the	pyramid	of	needs	.
They	're	selling	us	shoes	and	cars	.
Whereas	the	people	who	are	selling	us	the	higher	stuff	--	the	therapists	,	the	poets	--	are	on	their	own	and	they	have	no	power	,	they	have	no	might	.
So	religions	are	the	 fore 	 most 	 	example	of	an	institution	that	is	fighting	for	the	things	of	the	mind	.
Now	we	may	not	agree	with	what	religions	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	teach	us	,	but	we	can	 admir 	 e 	 	the	institutional	way	in	which	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
Books	alone	,	books	written	by	lone	 individual 	 s 	 	,	are	not	going	to	change	anything	.
We	need	to	group	together	.
If	you	want	to	change	the	world	,	you	have	to	group	together	,	you	have	to	be	collaborative	.
And	that	's	what	religions	do	.
They	are	 multi 	 national 	 	,	as	I	say	,	they	are	branded	,	they	have	a	clear	identity	,	so	they	do	n't	get	lost	in	a	busy	world	.
That	's	something	we	can	learn	from	.
I	want	to	 conclud 	 e 	 	.
 Re 	 ally 	 	what	I	want	to	say	is	for	many	of	you	who	are	operating	in	a	range	of	different	fields	,	there	is	something	to	learn	from	the	example	of	religion	--	even	if	you	do	n't	believe	any	of	it	.
If	you	're	involved	in	anything	that	's	communal	,	that	 involve 	 s 	 	lots	of	people	getting	together	,	there	are	things	for	you	in	religion	.
If	you	're	involved	,	say	,	in	a	travel	industry	in	any	way	,	look	at	pilgrimage	.
Look	very	 close 	 ly 	 	at	pilgrimage	.
We	have	n't	begun	to	scratch	the	surface	of	what	travel	could	be	because	we	have	n't	looked	at	what	religions	do	with	travel	.
If	you	're	in	the	art	world	,	look	at	the	example	of	what	religions	are	 do 	 ing 	 	with	art	.
And	if	you	're	an	educator	in	any	way	,	again	,	look	at	how	religions	are	spreading	ideas	.
You	may	not	agree	with	the	ideas	,	but	my	goodness	,	they	're	highly	effective	mechanisms	for	 do 	 ing 	 	so	.
So	 re 	 ally 	 	my	 conclud 	 ing 	 	point	is	you	may	not	agree	with	religion	,	but	at	the	end	of	the	day	,	religions	are	so	subtle	,	so	complicated	,	so	intelligent	in	many	ways	that	they	're	not	fit	to	be	abandoned	to	the	religious	alone	;	they	're	for	all	of	us	.
Thank	you	very	much	.
Chris	Anderson	:	Now	this	is	actually	a	 courage 	 ous 	 	talk	,	because	you	're	kind	of	setting	up	yourself	in	some	ways	to	be	 ridicul 	 ed 	 	in	some	quarters	.
AB	:	You	can	get	shot	by	both	sides	.
You	can	get	shot	by	the	 hard 	 - 	 headed 	 	 atheist 	 s 	 	,	and	you	can	get	shot	by	those	who	fully	believe	.
CA	:	 In 	 coming 	 	missiles	from	North	Oxford	at	any	moment	.
AB	:	Indeed	.
CA	:	But	you	left	out	one	aspect	of	religion	that	a	lot	of	people	might	say	your	agenda	could	borrow	from	,	which	is	this	sense	--	that	's	actually	probably	the	most	important	thing	to	 any 	 one 	 	who	's	religious	--	of	spiritual	experience	,	of	some	kind	of	connection	with	something	that	's	 bigg 	 er 	 	than	you	are	.
Is	there	any	room	for	that	experience	in	Atheism	2.0	?
AB	:	 Absolute 	 ly 	 	.	I	,	like	many	of	you	,	meet	people	who	say	things	like	,	``	But	is	n't	there	something	 bigg 	 er 	 	than	us	,	And	I	say	,	``	Of	course	.	''	And	they	say	,	``	So	are	n't	you	sort	of	religious	?	''
And	I	go	,	``	No	.	''	Why	does	that	sense	of	mystery	,	that	sense	of	the	 dizzy 	 ing 	 	scale	of	the	universe	,	need	to	be	 a 	 ccompanied 	 	by	a	 mystic 	 al 	 	feeling	?
Science	and	just	observation	gives	us	that	feeling	without	it	,	so	I	do	n't	feel	the	need	.
The	universe	is	large	and	we	are	tiny	,	without	the	need	for	further	religious	 super 	 structure 	 	.
So	one	can	have	 so 	 - 	 called 	 	spiritual	 moment 	 s 	 	without	belief	in	the	spirit	.
CA	:	Actually	,	let	me	just	ask	a	question	.
How	many	people	here	would	say	that	religion	is	important	to	them	?
Is	there	an	equivalent	process	by	which	there	's	a	sort	of	bridge	between	what	you	're	talking	about	and	what	you	would	say	to	them	?
AB	:	I	would	say	that	there	are	many	,	many	gaps	in	secular	life	and	these	can	be	plugged	.
It	's	not	as	though	,	as	I	try	to	suggest	,	it	's	not	as	though	either	you	have	religion	and	then	you	have	to	accept	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	things	,	or	you	do	n't	have	religion	and	then	you	're	cut	off	from	all	these	very	good	things	.
It	's	so	sad	that	we	 constant 	 ly 	 	say	,	``	I	do	n't	believe	so	I	ca	n't	have	community	,	so	I	'm	cut	off	from	morality	,	so	I	ca	n't	go	on	a	pilgrimage	.	''
One	 want 	 s 	 	to	say	,	``	 Non 	 sense 	 	.	Why	not	?	''
And	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	the	spirit	of	my	talk	.
There	's	so	much	we	can	absorb	.
Atheism	should	n't	cut	itself	off	from	the	rich	sources	of	religion	.
CA	:	It	 seem 	 s 	 	to	me	that	there	's	plenty	of	people	in	the	TED	community	who	are	 atheist 	 s 	 	.
But	probably	most	people	in	the	community	 certain 	 ly 	 	do	n't	think	that	religion	is	going	away	any	time	soon	and	want	to	find	the	language	to	have	a	constructive	dialogue	and	to	feel	like	we	can	actually	talk	to	each	other	and	at	least	share	some	things	in	common	.
Are	we	foolish	to	be	 optimist 	 ic 	 	about	the	possibility	of	a	world	where	,	instead	of	religion	being	the	great	 rally 	 ing 	 	cry	of	divide	and	war	,	that	there	could	be	 bridg 	 ing 	 	?
AB	:	No	,	we	need	to	be	polite	about	differences	.
 Polite 	 ness 	 	is	a	 much 	 - 	 overlook 	 ed 	 	virtue	.
It	's	seen	as	 hypo 	 crisy 	 	.
But	we	need	to	get	to	a	stage	when	you	're	an	atheist	and	someone	says	,	``	Well	you	know	,	I	did	pray	the	other	day	,	''	you	 polite 	 ly 	 	ignore	it	.
You	move	on	.
Because	you	've	agreed	on	90	percent	of	things	,	because	you	have	a	shared	view	on	so	many	things	,	and	you	 polite 	 ly 	 	differ	.
And	I	think	that	's	what	the	religious	wars	of	late	have	 ignor 	 ed 	 	.
They	've	 ignor 	 ed 	 	the	possibility	of	harmonious	 dis 	 agreement 	 	.
CA	:	And	finally	,	does	this	new	thing	that	you	're	 propos 	 ing 	 	that	's	not	a	religion	but	something	else	,	does	it	need	a	leader	,	and	are	you	 volunteer 	 ing 	 	to	be	the	pope	?
AB	:	Well	,	one	thing	that	we	're	all	very	 suspicio 	 us 	 	of	is	individual	leaders	.
It	does	n't	need	it	.
What	I	've	tried	to	lay	out	is	a	framework	and	I	'm	 hop 	 ing 	 	that	people	can	just	fill	it	in	.
I	've	 sketch 	 ed 	 	a	sort	of	broad	framework	.
But	 where 	 ver 	 	you	are	,	as	I	say	,	if	you	're	in	the	travel	industry	,	do	that	travel	bit	.
If	you	're	in	the	communal	industry	,	look	at	religion	and	do	the	communal	bit	.
So	it	's	a	wiki	project	.
CA	:	Alain	,	thank	you	for	 s 	 parking 	 	many	 conversation 	 s 	 	later	.

Since	we	've	 arriv 	 ed 	 	,	there	's	been	a	constant	buzz	about	all	the	 excit 	 ing 	 	speakers	here	for	the	conference	.
This	morning	we	've	heard	a	lot	of	 whisper 	 s 	 	about	Tom	Reilly	's	 wrap 	 - 	 up 	 	on	Saturday	.	Einstein	,	did	you	hear	 whisper 	 s 	 	?
E	:	[	 Squawk 	 s 	 	]	SW	:	Yeah	.
Einstein	's	especially	interested	in	Penelope	's	talk	.
A	lot	of	her	research	goes	on	in	caves	,	which	can	get	pretty	dusty	.
E	:	 A 	 choo 	 	!
SW	:	It	could	make	her	sneeze	.	But	more	 important 	 ly 	 	,	her	research	could	help	Einstein	find	a	cure	for	her	 never 	 - 	 ending 	 	 scratch 	 y 	 	throat	.
Einstein	:	[	 Cough 	 s 	 	]	SW	:	Yeah	.
Well	,	Bob	Russell	was	telling	us	about	his	work	on	nanotubes	in	his	research	at	the	microscopic	level	.
Well	,	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	,	but	what	Einstein	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 hop 	 ing 	 	is	that	maybe	he	'll	genetically	engineer	a	 five 	 - 	 pound 	 	peanut	.
E	:	Oh	,	my	God	!	My	God	!	My	God	!
SW	:	Yeah	.	She	would	get	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	excited	.
That	is	one	big	peanut	.	Since	Einstein	is	a	bird	,	she	's	very	interested	in	things	that	fly	.
She	 think 	 s 	 	Burt	Rutan	is	very	 impressiv 	 e 	 	.
E	:	Ooh	.
SW	:	Yeah	.	She	especially	 like 	 s 	 	his	latest	achievement	,	 SpaceShip 	 One 	 	.
Einstein	,	would	you	like	to	ride	in	Burt	's	 space 	 ship 	 	?
E	:	[	 Space 	 ship 	 	noise	]	SW	:	Even	if	it	does	n't	have	a	laser	?
E	:	[	Laser	noise	]	SW	:	Yeah	,	yeah	.	That	was	pretty	funny	,	Einstein	.
Now	,	Einstein	also	 think 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	working	in	caves	and	 travel 	 ling 	 	through	space	--	it	's	all	very	dangerous	jobs	.
It	would	be	very	dangerous	if	you	fell	down	.
E	:	 Whe 	 eeeeee 	 	!	[	Splat	]	SW	:	Yeah	.
Little	splat	at	the	end	there	.	Einstein	,	did	that	hurt	?
E	:	Ow	,	ow	,	ow	.
SW	:	Yeah	.	It	's	all	a	lot	of	hard	work	.
E	:	[	 Squawk 	 s 	 	]	SW	:	Yeah	.	It	can	get	a	bird	like	Einstein	 frustrat 	 ed 	 	.
E	:	[	 Squawk 	 s 	 	]	SW	:	Yeah	,	it	sure	can	.	But	when	Einstein	needs	to	relax	from	her	job	 educat 	 ing 	 	the	public	,	she	loves	to	take	in	the	arts	.
If	the	children	of	the	Uganda	need	another	dance	partner	,	Einstein	could	sure	fit	the	bill	,	because	she	loves	to	dance	.
Can	you	get	down	?
E	:	[	 Bobb 	 ing 	 	head	]	SW	:	Let	's	get	down	for	everybody	.	Come	on	now	.
She	's	going	to	make	me	do	it	,	too	.	Ooh	,	ooh	.
Einstein	:	Ooh	,	ooh	,	ooh	,	ooh	.
SW	:	Do	your	head	now	.
E	:	Ooh	,	ooh	,	ooh	,	ooh	,	ooh	.
SW	:	Or	maybe	 Siren 	 a 	 	Huang	would	like	to	learn	some	arias	on	her	violin	,	and	Einstein	can	 s 	 ing 	 	along	with	some	opera	?
E	:	[	 Opera 	 tic 	 	squawk	]	SW	:	Very	good	.
Or	maybe	Stu	just	needs	another	backup	singer	?
Einstein	,	can	you	also	 s 	 ing 	 	?
I	know	,	you	need	to	get	rid	of	that	seed	first	.	Can	you	 s 	 ing 	 	?
E	:	La	,	la	.
SW	:	There	you	go	.	And	,	of	course	,	if	all	else	 fail 	 s 	 	,	you	can	just	run	off	and	enjoy	a	fun	fiesta	.
E	:	[	 Squawk 	 s 	 	]	SW	:	All	right	.	Well	,	Einstein	was	pretty	 embarrass 	 ed 	 	to	admit	this	earlier	,	but	she	was	telling	me	backstage	that	she	had	a	problem	.
E	:	What	's	the	matter	?
SW	:	No	,	I	do	n't	have	a	problem	.	You	have	the	problem	,	remember	?
You	were	saying	that	you	were	 re 	 ally 	 	 embarrass 	 ed 	 	,	because	you	're	in	love	with	a	pirate	?
E	:	Yar	.
SW	:	There	you	go	.	And	what	do	pirates	like	to	drink	?
E	:	Beer	.
SW	:	Yeah	,	that	's	right	.	But	you	do	n't	like	to	drink	beer	,	Einstein	.
You	like	to	drink	water	.
E	:	[	Water	sound	]	SW	:	Very	good	.	Now	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	she	is	pretty	nervous	.
Because	one	of	her	 favorit 	 e 	 	folks	from	back	home	is	here	,	and	she	's	pretty	nervous	to	meet	him	.
She	 think 	 s 	 	Al	Gore	is	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 good 	 - 	 looking 	 	man	.
What	do	you	say	to	a	 good 	 - 	 looking 	 	man	?
E	:	Hey	,	baby	.
SW	:	And	so	do	all	the	folks	back	home	in	Tennessee	.
E	:	Yee	haw	.
SW	:	And	since	she	's	such	a	big	fan	,	she	knows	that	his	birthday	is	coming	up	at	the	end	of	March	.
And	we	did	n't	think	he	'd	be	in	town	then	,	so	Einstein	wanted	to	do	something	special	for	him	.
So	let	's	see	if	Einstein	will	 s 	 ing 	 	``	Happy	Birthday	''	to	Al	Gore	.
Can	you	 s 	 ing 	 	``	Happy	Birthday	''	to	him	?
E	:	Happy	birthday	to	you	.
SW	:	Again	.
E	:	Happy	birthday	to	you	.
SW	:	Again	.
E	:	Happy	birthday	to	you	.
SW	:	Big	finish	.
E	:	Happy	birthday	to	you	.
SW	:	Good	job	!
Well	,	before	we	wrap	it	up	,	she	would	like	to	give	a	shout	out	to	all	our	animal	friends	back	at	the	Knoxville	Zoo	.
Einstein	,	do	you	want	to	say	``	hi	''	to	all	the	 owl 	 s 	 	?
E	:	Woo	,	woo	,	woo	.
SW	:	What	about	the	other	birds	?
E	:	Tweet	,	tweet	,	tweet	.
SW	:	And	the	penguin	?
E	:	Quack	,	quack	,	quack	.
SW	:	There	we	go	.
Let	's	get	that	one	out	of	there	.	How	about	a	 chim 	 panzee 	 	?
E	:	Ooh	,	ooh	,	ooh	.	Aah	,	 a 	 ah 	 	,	 a 	 ah 	 	.
SW	:	Very	good	.
What	about	a	wolf	?
E	:	 O 	 oooo 	 www 	 	.
SW	:	And	a	pig	?
E	:	Oink	,	 o 	 ink 	 	,	 o 	 ink 	 	.
SW	:	And	the	rooster	?
E	:	 Cock 	 - 	 a 	 - 	 doodle 	 - 	 doo 	 	!
SW	:	And	how	about	those	cats	?
E	:	Meow	.
SW	:	At	the	zoo	we	have	big	cats	from	the	jungle	.
E	:	 G 	 rrrrr 	 	.
SW	:	What	about	a	skunk	?
E	:	 Stink 	 er 	 	.
SW	:	She	's	a	comedian	.	I	suppose	you	think	you	're	famous	?	Are	you	famous	?
E	:	Superstar	.
SW	:	Yeah	.	You	are	a	 super 	 star 	 	.
Well	,	we	would	like	to	encourage	all	of	you	to	do	your	part	to	help	protect	Einstein	's	animal	friends	,	and	to	do	your	part	to	help	protect	their	homes	that	they	live	[	in	]	.
Now	,	Einstein	does	say	it	best	when	we	ask	her	.
Why	do	we	want	to	protect	your	home	?
E	:	I	'm	special	.
SW	:	You	are	very	special	.	What	would	you	like	to	say	to	all	these	nice	people	?
E	:	I	love	you	.
SW	:	That	's	good	.	Can	you	blow	them	a	kiss	?
E	:	[	Kissing	noise	]	SW	:	And	what	do	you	say	when	it	's	time	to	go	?
E	:	Goodbye	.
SW	:	Good	job	.	Thank	you	all	.

Tim	 Ferris 	 s 	 	:	Smash	fear	,	learn	anything
This	is	Tim	 Ferris 	 s 	 	circa	1979	A.D.	Age	two	.
You	can	tell	by	the	power	squat	,	I	was	a	very	confident	boy	--	and	not	without	reason	.
I	had	a	very	 charm 	 ing 	 	routine	at	the	time	,	which	was	to	wait	until	late	in	the	evening	when	my	parents	were	 de 	 compress 	 ing 	 	from	a	hard	day	's	work	,	 do 	 ing 	 	their	 cross 	 word 	 	 puzzle 	 s 	 	,	watching	television	.
I	would	run	into	the	living	room	,	jump	up	on	the	couch	,	rip	the	 cushion 	 s 	 	off	,	throw	them	on	the	floor	,	scream	at	the	top	of	my	lungs	and	run	out	because	I	was	the	Incredible	Hulk	.
 Obvious 	 ly 	 	,	you	see	the	 re 	 semblance 	 	.
And	this	routine	went	on	for	some	time	.
When	I	was	seven	I	went	to	summer	camp	.
My	parents	found	it	necessary	for	peace	of	mind	.
And	at	noon	each	day	the	 camper 	 s 	 	would	go	to	a	pond	,	where	they	had	floating	docks	.
You	could	jump	off	the	end	into	the	deep	end	.
I	was	born	premature	.	I	was	always	very	small	.
My	left	lung	had	 collapse 	 d 	 	when	I	was	born	.
And	I	've	always	had	buoyancy	problems	.
So	water	was	something	that	scared	me	to	begin	with	.
But	I	would	go	in	on	occasion	.
And	on	one	particular	day	,	the	 camper 	 s 	 	were	jumping	through	inner	tubes	,	They	were	diving	through	inner	tubes	.	And	I	thought	this	would	be	great	fun	.
So	I	dove	through	the	inner	tube	,	and	the	bully	of	the	camp	 grabb 	 ed 	 	my	 ankle 	 s 	 	.
And	I	tried	to	come	up	for	air	,	and	my	lower	back	hit	the	bottom	of	the	inner	tube	.
And	I	went	wild	eyed	and	thought	I	was	going	to	die	.
A	camp	 counsel 	 or 	 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	came	over	and	separated	us	.
From	that	point	onward	I	was	 ter 	 rified 	 	of	swimming	.
That	is	something	that	I	did	not	get	over	.
My	 in 	 ability 	 	to	swim	has	been	one	of	my	greatest	 humiliation 	 s 	 	and	 embarrass 	 ments 	 	.
That	is	when	I	 re 	 alized 	 	that	I	was	not	the	Incredible	Hulk	.
But	there	is	a	happy	ending	to	this	story	.
At	age	31	--	that	's	my	age	now	--	in	August	I	took	two	weeks	to	 re 	 - 	 examine 	 	swimming	,	and	question	all	the	of	the	obvious	aspects	of	swimming	.
And	went	from	swimming	one	lap	--	so	20	yards	--	like	a	 drown 	 ing 	 	monkey	,	at	about	200	beats	per	minute	heart	rate	--	I	measured	it	--	to	going	to	Montauk	on	Long	Island	,	close	to	where	I	grew	up	,	and	jumping	into	the	ocean	and	swimming	one	kilometer	in	open	water	,	getting	out	and	feeling	better	than	when	I	went	in	.
And	I	came	out	,	in	my	 Speed 	 os 	 	,	European	style	,	feeling	like	the	Incredible	Hulk	.
And	that	's	what	I	want	everyone	in	here	to	feel	like	,	the	Incredible	Hulk	,	at	the	end	of	this	presentation	.
More	 s 	 pecifically 	 	,	I	want	you	to	feel	like	you	're	capable	of	becoming	an	excellent	 long 	 - 	 distance 	 	swimmer	,	a	 world 	 - 	 class 	 	language	learner	,	and	a	tango	champion	.
And	I	would	like	to	share	my	art	.
If	I	have	an	art	,	it	's	 deconstruct 	 ing 	 	things	that	 re 	 ally 	 	scare	the	living	hell	out	of	me	.
So	,	moving	onward	.
Swimming	,	first	principles	.
First	principles	,	this	is	very	important	.
I	find	that	the	best	results	in	life	are	often	held	back	by	false	 construct 	 s 	 	and	 un 	 tested 	 	 assumption 	 s 	 	.
And	the	turnaround	in	swimming	came	when	a	friend	of	mine	said	,	``	I	will	go	a	year	without	any	 stimulant 	 s 	 	''	--	this	is	a	 six 	 - 	 double 	 - 	 espresso 	 - 	 per 	 - 	 day 	 	type	of	guy	--	``	if	you	can	complete	a	one	kilometer	open	water	race	.	''
So	the	clock	started	 tick 	 ing 	 	.
I	started	seeking	out	 tri 	 athletes 	 	because	I	found	that	 life 	 long 	 	 swimmer 	 s 	 	often	could	n't	teach	what	they	did	.
I	tried	 kick 	 boards 	 	.
My	feet	would	slice	through	the	water	like	 razor 	 s 	 	,	I	would	n't	even	move	.	I	would	leave	 demora 	 lized 	 	,	 star 	 ing 	 	at	my	feet	.
Hand	 paddle 	 s 	 	,	everything	.
Even	did	lessons	with	 Olympia 	 ns 	 	--	nothing	 help 	 ed 	 	.
And	then	Chris	Sacca	,	who	is	now	a	dear	friend	mine	,	had	completed	an	Iron	Man	with	103	degree	temperature	,	said	,	``	I	have	the	answer	to	your	prayers	.	''
And	he	introduced	me	to	the	work	of	a	man	named	Terry	Laughlin	who	is	the	founder	of	Total	Immersion	Swimming	.
That	set	me	on	the	road	to	 examin 	 ing 	 	 biomechanic 	 s 	 	.
So	here	are	the	new	rules	of	swimming	,	if	any	of	you	are	afraid	of	swimming	,	or	not	good	at	it	.
The	first	is	,	forget	about	kicking	.	Very	 counter 	 intuitive 	 	.
So	it	turns	out	that	propulsion	is	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	the	problem	.
Kicking	 hard 	 er 	 	does	n't	solve	the	problem	because	the	average	swimmer	only	 transfer 	 s 	 	about	three	percent	of	their	energy	expenditure	into	forward	motion	.
The	problem	is	 hydrodynamic 	 s 	 	.
So	what	you	want	to	focus	on	instead	is	 a 	 llowing 	 	your	lower	body	to	draft	behind	your	upper	body	,	much	like	a	small	car	behind	a	big	car	on	the	highway	.
And	you	do	that	by	 maintain 	 ing 	 	a	horizontal	body	position	.
The	only	way	you	can	do	that	is	to	not	swim	on	top	of	the	water	.
The	body	is	 dens 	 er 	 	than	water	.	95	percent	of	it	would	be	,	at	least	,	 sub 	 merged 	 	 natural 	 ly 	 	.
So	you	end	up	,	number	three	,	not	swimming	,	in	the	case	of	freestyle	,	on	your	stomach	,	as	many	people	think	,	reaching	on	top	of	the	water	.
But	actually	rotating	from	 streamlin 	 ed 	 	right	to	 streamlin 	 ed 	 	left	,	 maintain 	 ing 	 	that	fuselage	position	as	long	as	possible	.
So	let	's	look	at	some	examples	.	This	is	Terry	.
And	you	can	see	that	he	's	 extend 	 ing 	 	his	right	arm	below	his	head	and	far	in	front	.
And	so	his	entire	body	 re 	 ally 	 	is	 under 	 water 	 	.
The	arm	is	extended	below	the	head	.
The	head	is	held	in	line	with	the	spine	,	so	that	you	use	strategic	water	pressure	to	raise	your	legs	up	--	very	important	,	especially	for	people	with	lower	body	fat	.
Here	is	an	example	of	the	stroke	.
So	you	do	n't	kick	.	But	you	do	use	a	small	flick	.
You	can	see	this	is	the	left	extension	.
Then	you	see	his	left	leg	.
Small	flick	,	and	the	only	purpose	of	that	is	to	rotate	his	hips	so	he	can	get	to	the	opposite	side	.
And	the	entry	point	for	his	right	hand	--	notice	this	,	he	's	not	reaching	in	front	and	catching	the	water	.
Rather	,	he	is	 enter 	 ing 	 	the	water	at	a	45-degree	angle	with	his	forearm	,	and	then	 propel 	 ling 	 	himself	by	 streamlin 	 ing 	 	--	very	important	.
 In 	 correct 	 	,	above	,	which	is	what	almost	every	swimming	coach	will	teach	you	.
Not	their	fault	,	 honest 	 ly 	 	.
And	I	'll	get	to	implicit	versus	explicit	in	a	moment	.
Below	is	what	most	 swimmer 	 s 	 	will	find	 en 	 ables 	 	them	to	do	what	I	did	,	which	is	going	from	21	strokes	per	20-yard	length	to	11	strokes	in	two	 work 	 outs 	 	with	no	coach	,	no	video	monitoring	.
And	now	I	love	swimming	.	I	ca	n't	wait	to	go	swimming	.
I	'll	be	 do 	 ing 	 	a	swimming	lesson	later	,	for	myself	,	if	 any 	 one 	 	 want 	 s 	 	to	join	me	.
Last	thing	,	breathing	.	A	problem	a	lot	of	us	have	,	 certain 	 ly 	 	,	when	you	're	swimming	.
In	freestyle	,	easiest	way	to	remedy	this	is	to	turn	with	body	roll	,	and	just	to	look	at	your	recovery	hand	as	it	enters	the	water	.
And	that	will	get	you	very	far	.
That	's	it	.	That	's	 re 	 ally 	 	all	you	need	to	know	.
Languages	.	Material	versus	method	.
I	,	like	many	people	,	came	to	the	conclusion	that	I	was	terrible	at	languages	.
I	 suffer 	 ed 	 	through	Spanish	for	junior	high	,	first	year	of	high	school	,	and	the	sum	total	of	my	knowledge	was	pretty	much	,	``	Donde	esta	el	bano	?	''
And	I	would	n't	even	catch	the	response	.	A	sad	state	of	affairs	.
Then	I	transferred	to	a	different	school	 sophomor 	 e 	 	year	,	and	I	had	a	choice	of	other	languages	.	Most	of	my	friends	were	taking	Japanese	.
So	I	thought	why	not	punish	myself	?	I	'll	do	Japanese	.
Six	months	later	I	had	the	chance	to	go	to	Japan	.
My	teachers	assured	me	,	they	said	,	``	Do	n't	worry	.
You	'll	have	Japanese	language	classes	every	day	to	help	you	cope	.
It	will	be	an	amazing	experience	.	''	My	first	overseas	experience	in	fact	.
So	my	parents	encouraged	me	to	do	it	.	I	left	.
I	 arriv 	 ed 	 	in	Tokyo	.	Amazing	.
I	could	n't	believe	I	was	on	the	other	side	of	the	world	.
I	met	my	host	family	.	Things	went	quite	well	I	think	,	all	things	considered	.
My	first	evening	,	before	my	first	day	of	school	,	I	said	to	my	mother	,	very	 polite 	 ly 	 	,	``	Please	wake	me	up	at	eight	a.m	.	''
So	,	But	I	did	n't	say	.	I	said	,	.	Pretty	close	.
But	I	said	,	``	Please	rape	me	at	eight	a.m	.	''
You	've	never	seen	a	more	 confus 	 ed 	 	Japanese	woman	.
I	walked	in	to	school	.
And	a	teacher	came	up	to	me	and	handed	me	a	piece	of	paper	.
I	could	n't	read	any	of	it	--	 hieroglyphic 	 s 	 	,	it	could	have	been	--	because	it	was	Kanji	,	Chinese	characters	adapted	into	the	Japanese	language	.
Asked	him	what	this	said	.
And	he	goes	,	``	Ahh	,	okay	okay	,	 e 	 eh 	 to 	 	,	World	History	,	 eh 	 h 	 	,	Calculus	,	Traditional	Japanese	.	''	And	so	on	.
And	so	it	came	to	me	in	waves	.
There	had	been	something	lost	in	translation	.
The	Japanese	classes	were	not	Japanese	instruction	classes	,	per	se	.
They	were	the	normal	high	school	curriculum	for	Japanese	students	--	the	other	4,999	students	in	the	school	,	who	were	Japanese	,	besides	the	American	.
And	that	's	pretty	much	my	response	.
And	that	set	me	on	this	panic	driven	search	for	the	perfect	language	method	.
I	tried	everything	.	I	went	to	 Kino 	 kuni 	 ya 	 	.
I	tried	every	possible	book	,	every	possible	CD	.
Nothing	worked	until	I	found	this	.
This	is	the	Joyo	Kanji	.	This	is	a	Tablet	rather	,	or	a	poster	of	the	1,945	 common 	 - 	 use 	 	characters	as	determined	by	the	Ministry	of	Education	in	1981	.
Many	of	the	publications	in	Japan	limit	themselves	to	these	characters	,	to	 facilitat 	 e 	 	literacy	--	some	are	required	to	.
And	this	became	my	Holy	Grail	,	my	Rosetta	Stone	.
As	soon	as	I	focused	on	this	material	,	I	took	off	.
I	ended	up	being	able	to	read	Asahi	 Shin 	 bu 	 	,	Asahi	newspaper	,	about	six	months	later	--	so	a	total	of	11	months	later	--	and	went	from	Japanese	I	to	Japanese	VI	.
Ended	up	 do 	 ing 	 	translation	work	at	age	16	when	I	returned	to	the	U.S.	,	and	have	continued	to	apply	this	material	over	method	approach	to	close	to	a	dozen	languages	now	.
Someone	who	was	terrible	at	languages	,	and	at	any	given	time	,	speak	,	read	and	write	five	or	six	.
This	 bring 	 s 	 	us	to	the	point	,	which	is	,	it	's	 often 	 times 	 	what	you	do	,	not	how	you	do	it	,	that	is	the	 determin 	 ing 	 	factor	.
This	is	the	difference	between	being	effective	--	 do 	 ing 	 	the	right	things	--	and	being	efficient	--	 do 	 ing 	 	things	well	whether	or	not	they	're	important	.
You	can	also	do	this	with	grammar	.
I	came	up	with	these	six	 sentence 	 s 	 	after	much	 experiment 	 ation 	 	.
Having	a	native	speaker	allow	you	to	deconstruct	their	grammar	,	by	 translat 	 ing 	 	these	 sentence 	 s 	 	into	past	,	present	,	future	,	will	show	you	subject	,	object	,	verb	,	placement	of	indirect	,	direct	objects	,	gender	and	so	forth	.
From	that	point	,	you	can	then	,	if	you	want	to	,	 acquir 	 e 	 	multiple	languages	,	alternate	them	so	there	is	no	interference	.
We	can	talk	about	that	if	 any 	 one 	 	in	interested	.
And	now	I	love	languages	.
So	 ball 	 room 	 	dancing	,	implicit	versus	explicit	--	very	important	.
You	might	look	at	me	and	say	,	``	That	guy	must	be	a	 ball 	 room 	 	dancer	.	''
But	no	,	you	'd	be	wrong	because	my	body	is	very	 poor 	 ly 	 	designed	for	most	things	--	pretty	well	designed	for	lifting	heavy	rocks	 perhap 	 s 	 	.
I	used	to	be	much	 bigg 	 er 	 	,	much	more	muscular	.
And	so	I	ended	up	walking	like	this	.
I	looked	a	lot	like	an	orangutan	,	our	close	 cousin 	 s 	 	,	or	the	Incredible	Hulk	.
Not	very	good	for	 ball 	 room 	 	dancing	.
I	found	myself	in	Argentina	in	2005	,	decided	to	watch	a	tango	class	--	had	no	intention	of	 participat 	 ing 	 	.
Went	in	,	paid	my	ten	 pes 	 os 	 	,	walked	up	--	10	women	two	guys	,	usually	a	good	ratio	.
The	instructor	says	,	``	You	are	 participat 	 ing 	 	.	''
Immediately	:	death	sweat	.
 Fight 	 - 	 or 	 - 	 flight 	 	fear	sweat	,	because	I	tried	 ball 	 room 	 	dancing	in	college	--	stepped	on	the	girl	's	foot	with	my	heel	.	She	 scream 	 ed 	 	.
I	was	so	concerned	with	her	perception	of	what	I	was	 do 	 ing 	 	,	that	it	exploded	in	my	face	,	never	to	return	to	the	 ball 	 room 	 	dancing	club	.
She	comes	up	,	and	this	was	her	approach	,	the	teacher	.
``	Okay	,	come	on	,	grab	me	.	''
 Gorge 	 ous 	 	assistant	instructor	.
She	was	very	 piss 	 ed 	 	off	that	I	had	 pull 	 ed 	 	her	from	her	advanced	practice	.
So	I	did	my	best	.	I	did	n't	know	where	to	put	my	hands	.
And	she	 pull 	 ed 	 	back	,	threw	down	her	arms	,	put	them	on	her	hips	,	turned	around	and	 yell 	 ed 	 	across	the	room	,	``	This	guy	is	built	like	a	 god 	 - 	 damned 	 	mountain	of	muscle	,	and	he	's	 grabb 	 ing 	 	me	like	a	fucking	 French 	 man 	 	,	''	which	I	found	 encourag 	 ing 	 	.
Everyone	burst	into	laughter	.	I	was	 humili 	 ated 	 	.
She	came	back	.	She	goes	,	``	Come	on	.	I	do	n't	have	all	day	.	''
As	someone	who	 wrestle 	 d 	 	since	age	eight	,	I	 proceed 	 ed 	 	to	crush	her	,	``	Of	Mice	and	Men	''	style	.
And	she	looked	up	and	said	,	``	Now	that	's	better	.	''
So	I	bought	a	month	's	worth	of	classes	.
And	 proceed 	 ed 	 	to	look	at	--	I	wanted	to	set	competition	so	I	'd	have	a	 dead 	 line 	 	--	Parkinson	's	Law	,	the	perceived	complexity	of	a	task	will	expand	to	fill	the	time	you	allot	it	.
So	I	had	a	very	short	 dead 	 line 	 	for	a	competition	.
I	got	a	female	instructor	first	,	to	teach	me	the	female	role	,	the	follow	,	because	I	wanted	to	understand	the	sensitivities	and	abilities	that	the	follow	needed	to	develop	,	so	I	would	n't	have	a	repeat	of	college	.
And	then	I	took	an	inventory	of	the	characteristics	,	along	with	her	,	of	the	of	the	capabilities	and	elements	of	different	dancers	who	'd	won	championships	.
I	 interview 	 ed 	 	these	people	because	they	all	taught	in	Buenos	Aires	.
I	compared	the	two	lists	,	and	what	you	find	is	that	there	is	 explicit 	 ly 	 	,	expertise	they	recommended	,	certain	training	methods	.
Then	there	were	implicit	 common 	 alities 	 	that	none	of	them	 see 	 med 	 	to	be	 practic 	 ing 	 	.
Now	the	 protection 	 ism 	 	of	Argentine	dance	teachers	 a 	 side 	 	,	I	found	this	very	 interest 	 ing 	 	.	So	I	decided	to	focus	on	three	of	those	 common 	 alities 	 	.
Long	steps	.	So	a	lot	of	 milon 	 gueros 	 	--	the	tango	dancers	will	use	very	short	steps	.
I	found	that	 long 	 er 	 	steps	were	much	more	elegant	.
So	you	can	have	--	and	you	can	do	it	in	a	very	small	space	in	fact	.
 Second 	 ly 	 	,	different	types	of	 pivot 	 s 	 	.
 Third 	 ly 	 	,	variation	in	tempo	.
These	 see 	 med 	 	to	be	the	three	areas	that	I	could	exploit	to	compete	if	I	wanted	to	 compte 	 te 	 	against	people	who	'd	been	 practic 	 ing 	 	for	20	to	30	years	.
That	photo	is	of	the	 semi 	 - 	 finals 	 	of	the	Buenos	Aires	championships	,	four	months	later	.
Then	one	month	later	,	went	to	the	world	championships	,	made	it	to	the	 semi 	 - 	 final 	 	.	And	then	set	a	world	record	,	following	that	,	two	weeks	later	.
I	want	you	to	see	part	of	what	I	 practic 	 ed 	 	.
I	'm	going	to	jump	forward	here	.
This	is	the	instructor	that	Alicia	and	I	chose	for	the	male	lead	.
His	name	is	Gabriel	 Miss 	 e 	 	.
One	of	the	most	elegant	dancers	of	his	generation	,	known	for	his	long	steps	,	and	his	tempo	changes	and	his	 pivot 	 s 	 	.
Alicia	,	in	her	own	right	,	very	famous	.
So	I	think	you	'll	agree	,	they	look	quite	good	together	.
Now	what	I	like	about	this	video	is	it	's	actually	a	video	of	the	first	time	they	ever	 dance 	 d 	 	together	because	of	his	lead	.	He	had	a	strong	lead	.
He	did	n't	lead	with	his	chest	,	which	 require 	 s 	 	you	lean	forward	.
I	could	n't	develop	the	attributes	in	my	toes	,	the	strength	in	my	feet	,	to	do	that	.
So	he	uses	a	lead	that	 focus 	 es 	 	on	his	shoulder	girdle	and	his	arm	.
So	he	can	lift	the	woman	to	break	her	,	for	example	.
That	's	just	one	benefit	of	that	.
So	then	we	broke	it	down	.
This	would	be	an	example	of	one	pivot	.
This	is	a	back	step	pivot	.
There	are	many	different	types	.
I	have	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	hours	of	footage	--	all	categorized	,	much	like	George	Carlin	categorized	his	comedy	.
So	 us 	 ing 	 	my	 arch 	 - 	 nemesis 	 	,	Spanish	,	no	less	,	to	learn	tango	.
So	fear	is	your	friend	.	Fear	is	an	indicator	.
Sometimes	it	shows	you	what	you	should	n't	do	.
More	often	than	not	it	shows	you	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	you	should	do	.
And	the	best	results	that	I	've	had	in	life	,	the	most	 enjoy 	 able 	 	times	,	have	all	been	from	 as 	 king 	 	a	simple	question	:	what	's	the	worst	that	can	happen	?
Especially	with	 fear 	 s 	 	you	gained	when	you	were	a	child	.
Take	the	analytical	 framework 	 s 	 	,	the	capabilities	you	have	,	apply	them	to	old	 fear 	 s 	 	.
Apply	them	to	very	big	dreams	.
And	when	I	think	of	what	I	fear	now	,	it	's	very	simple	.
When	I	imagine	my	life	,	what	my	life	would	have	been	like	without	the	educational	opportunities	that	I	had	,	it	makes	me	wonder	.
I	've	spent	the	last	two	years	 try 	 ing 	 	to	deconstruct	the	American	public	school	system	,	to	either	fix	it	or	replace	it	.
And	have	done	 experiment 	 s 	 	with	about	50,000	students	thus	far	--	built	,	I	'd	say	,	about	a	half	dozen	schools	,	my	readers	,	at	this	point	.
And	if	any	of	you	are	interested	in	that	,	I	would	love	to	speak	with	you	.
I	know	nothing	.	I	'm	a	 beginn 	 er 	 	.
But	I	ask	a	lot	of	questions	,	and	I	would	love	your	advice	.
Thank	you	very	much	.

Geoff	 Mul 	 gan 	 	:	A	short	intro	to	the	Studio	School
What	I	want	to	talk	about	today	is	one	idea	.
It	's	an	idea	for	a	new	kind	of	school	,	which	turns	on	its	head	much	of	our	conventional	thinking	about	what	schools	are	for	and	how	they	work	.
And	it	might	just	be	coming	to	a	neighborhood	near	you	soon	.
Where	it	comes	from	is	an	organization	called	the	Young	Foundation	,	which	,	over	many	decades	,	has	come	up	with	many	 innovation 	 s 	 	in	education	,	like	the	Open	University	and	things	like	Extended	Schools	,	Schools	for	Social	 Entrepreneur 	 s 	 	,	Summer	Universities	and	the	School	of	Everything	.
And	about	five	years	ago	,	we	asked	what	was	the	most	important	need	for	innovation	in	 school 	 ing 	 	here	in	the	U.K	.
And	we	felt	the	most	important	priority	was	to	bring	together	two	sets	of	problems	.
One	was	large	numbers	of	bored	 teenager 	 s 	 	who	just	did	n't	like	school	,	could	n't	see	any	relationship	between	what	they	learned	in	school	and	future	jobs	.
And	 employer 	 s 	 	who	kept	 complain 	 ing 	 	that	the	kids	coming	out	of	school	were	n't	actually	ready	for	real	work	,	did	n't	have	the	right	attitudes	and	experience	.
And	so	we	try	to	ask	:	What	kind	of	school	would	have	the	 teenager 	 s 	 	fighting	to	get	in	,	not	fighting	to	stay	out	?
And	after	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 conversation 	 s 	 	with	 teenager 	 s 	 	and	teachers	and	parents	and	 employer 	 s 	 	and	schools	from	Paraguay	to	Australia	,	and	looking	at	some	of	the	academic	research	,	which	 show 	 ed 	 	the	importance	of	what	's	now	called	 non 	 - 	 cognitive 	 	skills	--	the	skills	of	motivation	,	 re 	 silience 	 	--	and	that	these	are	as	important	as	the	cognitive	skills	--	formal	academic	skills	--	we	came	up	with	an	answer	,	a	very	simple	answer	in	a	way	,	which	we	called	the	Studio	School	.
And	we	called	it	a	studio	school	to	go	back	to	the	original	idea	of	a	studio	in	the	Renaissance	where	work	and	learning	are	integrated	.
You	work	by	learning	,	and	you	learn	by	working	.
And	the	design	we	came	up	with	had	the	following	characteristics	.
First	of	all	,	we	wanted	small	schools	--	about	300	,	400	 pupil 	 s 	 	--	14	to	19	 year 	 - 	 olds 	 	,	and	 critical 	 ly 	 	,	about	80	percent	of	the	curriculum	done	not	through	sitting	in	 classroom 	 s 	 	,	but	through	 real 	 - 	 life 	 	,	practical	projects	,	working	on	commission	to	businesses	,	NGO	's	and	others	.
That	every	pupil	would	have	a	coach	,	as	well	as	teachers	,	who	would	have	 timetable 	 s 	 	much	more	like	a	work	environment	in	a	business	.
And	all	of	this	will	be	done	within	the	public	system	,	funded	by	public	money	,	but	 independent 	 ly 	 	run	.
And	all	at	no	extra	cost	,	no	selection	,	and	 a 	 llowing 	 	the	 pupil 	 s 	 	the	route	into	university	,	even	if	many	of	them	would	want	to	become	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	and	have	manual	jobs	as	well	.
Underlying	it	was	some	very	simple	ideas	that	large	numbers	of	 teenager 	 s 	 	learn	best	by	 do 	 ing 	 	things	,	they	learn	best	in	teams	and	they	learn	best	by	 do 	 ing 	 	things	for	real	--	all	the	opposite	of	what	mainstream	 school 	 ing 	 	actually	does	.
Now	that	was	a	nice	idea	,	so	we	moved	into	the	rapid	 prototyp 	 ing 	 	phase	.
We	tried	it	out	,	first	in	Luton	--	famous	for	its	airport	and	not	much	else	,	I	fear	--	and	in	Blackpool	--	famous	for	its	beaches	and	leisure	.
And	what	we	found	--	and	we	got	quite	a	lot	of	things	wrong	and	then	 improv 	 ed 	 	them	--	but	we	found	that	the	young	people	loved	it	.
They	found	it	much	more	 motivation 	 al 	 	,	much	more	 excit 	 ing 	 	than	traditional	education	.
And	 perhap 	 s 	 	most	important	of	all	,	two	years	later	when	the	exam	results	came	through	,	the	 pupil 	 s 	 	who	had	been	put	on	these	field	trials	who	were	in	the	 lo 	 west 	 	performing	groups	had	 jump 	 ed 	 	right	to	the	top	--	in	fact	,	pretty	much	at	the	top	 deci 	 le 	 	of	performance	in	terms	of	GCSE	's	,	which	is	the	British	marking	system	.
Now	not	 s 	 urprisingly 	 	,	that	 influence 	 d 	 	some	people	to	think	we	were	onto	something	.
The	minister	of	education	down	south	in	London	described	himself	as	a	``	big	fan	.	''
And	the	business	organizations	thought	we	were	onto	something	in	terms	of	a	way	of	preparing	children	much	better	for	 real 	 - 	 life 	 	work	today	.
And	 inde 	 ed 	 	,	the	head	of	the	Chambers	of	Commerce	is	now	the	chairman	of	the	Studio	Schools	Trust	and	 help 	 ing 	 	it	,	not	just	with	big	businesses	,	but	small	businesses	all	over	the	country	.
We	started	with	two	schools	.
That	's	grown	this	year	to	about	10	.
And	next	year	,	we	're	 expect 	 ing 	 	about	35	schools	open	across	England	,	and	another	40	areas	want	to	have	their	own	schools	opening	--	a	pretty	rapid	spread	of	this	idea	.
Interestingly	,	it	's	happened	almost	 entire 	 ly 	 	without	media	coverage	.
It	's	happened	almost	 entire 	 ly 	 	without	big	money	behind	it	.
It	spread	almost	 entire 	 ly 	 	through	word	of	mouth	,	 vir 	 ally 	 	,	across	teachers	,	parents	,	people	involved	in	education	.
And	it	spread	because	of	the	power	of	an	idea	--	so	the	very	,	very	simple	idea	about	turning	education	on	its	head	and	putting	the	things	which	were	marginal	,	things	like	working	in	teams	,	 do 	 ing 	 	practical	projects	,	and	putting	them	right	at	the	heart	of	learning	,	rather	than	on	the	edges	.
Now	there	's	a	whole	set	of	new	schools	opening	up	this	autumn	.
This	is	one	from	Yorkshire	where	,	in	fact	,	my	nephew	,	I	hope	,	will	be	able	to	attend	it	.
And	this	one	is	focused	on	creative	and	media	industries	.
Other	ones	have	a	focus	on	health	care	,	tourism	,	engineering	and	other	fields	.
We	think	we	're	onto	something	.
It	's	not	perfect	yet	,	but	we	think	this	is	one	idea	which	can	transform	the	lives	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	,	possibly	 million 	 s 	 	,	of	 teenager 	 s 	 	who	are	 re 	 ally 	 	bored	by	 school 	 ing 	 	.
It	does	n't	animate	them	.
They	're	not	like	all	of	you	who	can	sit	in	rows	and	hear	things	said	to	you	for	hour	after	hour	.
They	want	to	do	things	,	they	want	to	get	their	hands	dirty	,	they	want	education	to	be	for	real	.
And	my	hope	is	that	some	of	you	out	there	may	be	able	to	help	us	.
We	feel	we	're	on	the	beginning	of	a	journey	of	experiment	and	improvement	to	turn	the	Studio	School	idea	into	something	which	is	present	,	not	as	a	universal	answer	for	every	child	,	but	at	least	as	an	answer	for	some	children	in	every	part	of	the	world	.
And	I	hope	that	a	few	of	you	at	least	can	help	us	make	that	happen	.
Thank	you	very	much	.

Jimmy	Wales	 recall 	 s 	 	how	he	assembled	``	a	 rag 	 tag 	 	band	of	volunteers	,	''	gave	them	tools	for	 collabora 	 ting 	 	and	created	Wikipedia	,	the	 self 	 - 	 organizing 	 	,	 self 	 - 	 correct 	 ing 	 	,	 never 	 - 	 finished 	 	online	encyclopedia	.

Jimmy	Wales	on	the	birth	of	Wikipedia
In	1962	,	Charles	Van	Doren	,	who	was	later	a	senior	editor	of	Britannica	,	said	the	ideal	encyclopedia	should	be	radical	--	it	should	stop	being	safe	.
But	if	you	know	anything	about	the	history	of	Britannica	since	1962	,	it	was	anything	but	radical	:	still	a	very	 complete 	 ly 	 	safe	,	 stodg 	 y 	 	type	of	encyclopedia	.
Wikipedia	,	on	the	other	hand	,	begins	with	a	very	radical	idea	,	and	that	's	for	all	of	us	to	imagine	a	world	in	which	every	single	person	on	the	planet	is	given	free	access	to	the	sum	of	all	human	knowledge	.
And	that	's	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	.	So	Wikipedia	--	you	just	saw	the	little	demonstration	of	it	--	it	's	a	 free 	 ly 	 	licensed	encyclopedia	.	It	's	written	by	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	volunteers	all	over	the	world	in	many	,	many	languages	.
It	's	written	 us 	 ing 	 	Wiki	software	--	which	is	the	type	of	software	he	just	 demonstrat 	 ed 	 	--	so	 any 	 one 	 	can	quickly	edit	and	save	,	and	it	goes	live	on	the	Internet	 immediate 	 ly 	 	.
And	everything	about	Wikipedia	is	managed	by	 virtual 	 ly 	 	an	 all 	 - 	 volunteer 	 	staff	.
So	when	 Yocha 	 i 	 	is	talking	about	new	methods	of	organization	,	he	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	 describ 	 ing 	 	Wikipedia	.	And	what	I	'm	going	to	do	today	is	tell	you	a	little	bit	more	about	how	it	 re 	 ally 	 	works	on	the	inside	.
So	Wikipedia	's	owned	by	the	 Wiki 	 media 	 	Foundation	,	which	I	founded	,	a	 non 	 profit 	 	organization	.	And	our	goal	,	the	core	aim	of	the	 Wiki 	 media 	 	Foundation	,	is	to	get	a	free	encyclopedia	to	every	single	person	on	the	planet	.
And	so	if	you	think	about	what	that	means	,	it	means	a	lot	more	than	just	building	a	cool	website	.
We	're	 re 	 ally 	 	interested	in	all	the	issues	of	the	digital	divide	,	poverty	worldwide	,	 empower 	 ing 	 	people	everywhere	to	have	the	information	that	they	need	to	make	good	decisions	.
And	so	we	're	going	to	have	to	do	a	lot	of	work	that	goes	beyond	just	the	Internet	.
And	so	that	's	a	big	part	of	why	we	've	chosen	the	free	licensing	model	,	because	that	 empower 	 s 	 	local	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	--	or	 any 	 one 	 	who	 want 	 s 	 	to	,	can	take	our	content	and	do	anything	they	like	with	it	--	you	can	copy	it	,	 re 	 distribute 	 	it	and	you	can	do	it	 commercial 	 ly 	 	or	 non 	 - 	 commercial 	 ly 	 	.
So	there	's	a	lot	of	opportunities	that	are	going	to	 aris 	 e 	 	around	Wikipedia	all	over	the	world	.
We	're	funded	by	 donation 	 s 	 	from	the	public	,	and	one	of	the	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	things	about	that	is	how	little	money	it	actually	takes	to	run	Wikipedia	.
So	 Yocha 	 i 	 	 show 	 ed 	 	you	the	graph	of	what	the	cost	of	a	printing	press	was	.
And	I	'm	going	to	tell	you	what	the	cost	of	Wikipedia	is	,	but	first	I	'll	show	you	how	big	it	is	.
So	we	've	got	over	600,000	articles	in	English	.
We	've	got	two	million	total	articles	across	many	,	many	different	languages	.
The	biggest	languages	are	German	,	Japanese	,	French	--	all	the	Western	European	languages	are	quite	big	.
But	only	around	 one 	 - 	 third 	 	of	all	of	our	traffic	to	our	web	 cluster 	 s 	 	to	the	English	Wikipedia	,	which	is	 surpris 	 ing 	 	to	a	lot	of	people	.
A	lot	of	people	think	in	a	very	 English 	 - 	 centric 	 	way	on	the	Internet	,	but	for	us	,	we	're	 tru 	 ly 	 	global	.	We	're	in	many	,	many	languages	.
How	popular	we	've	gotten	to	be	--	we	're	a	top	50	website	and	we	're	more	popular	than	the	New	York	Times	.
So	this	is	where	we	get	to	 Yocha 	 i 	 	's	discussion	.
This	shows	the	growth	of	Wikipedia	--	we	're	the	blue	line	there	--	and	then	this	is	the	New	York	Times	over	there	.
And	what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	about	this	is	the	New	York	Times	website	is	a	huge	,	 e 	 normous 	 	corporate	operation	with	--	I	have	no	idea	how	many	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	employees	.
We	have	 exact 	 ly 	 	one	employee	,	and	that	employee	is	our	lead	software	developer	.
And	he	's	only	been	our	employee	since	January	2005	,	all	the	other	growth	before	that	.
So	the	servers	are	managed	by	a	 rag 	 - 	 tag 	 	band	of	volunteers	;	all	the	editing	is	done	by	volunteers	.
And	the	way	that	we	're	organized	is	not	like	any	traditional	organization	you	can	imagine	.
People	are	always	 as 	 king 	 	,	``	Well	,	who	's	in	charge	of	this	?	''
or	``	Who	does	that	?	''	And	the	answer	is	:	 any 	 body 	 	who	 want 	 s 	 	to	pitch	in	.
It	's	a	very	unusual	and	chaotic	thing	.
We	've	got	over	90	servers	now	in	three	locations	.
These	are	managed	by	volunteer	system	 administrator 	 s 	 	who	are	online	.
I	can	go	online	any	time	of	the	day	or	night	and	see	eight	to	10	people	waiting	for	me	to	ask	a	question	or	something	,	anything	about	the	servers	.
You	could	never	afford	to	do	this	in	a	company	.
You	could	never	afford	to	have	a	standby	crew	of	people	24	hours	a	day	and	do	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	at	Wikipedia	.
So	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	around	1.4	billion	page	views	monthly	,	so	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	gotten	to	be	a	huge	thing	.
And	everything	is	managed	by	the	volunteers	.
And	the	total	monthly	cost	for	our	 band 	 width 	 	is	about	5,000	dollars	.
And	that	's	 essential 	 ly 	 	our	main	cost	.
We	could	actually	do	without	the	employee	.	We	actually	--	we	hired	Brian	because	he	was	working	 part 	 - 	 time 	 	for	two	years	and	 full 	 - 	 time 	 	at	Wikipedia	,	so	we	actually	hired	him	so	he	could	get	a	life	and	go	to	the	movies	sometimes	.
So	the	big	question	when	you	've	got	this	 re 	 ally 	 	chaotic	organization	is	,	why	is	n't	it	all	rubbish	?	Why	is	the	website	as	good	as	it	is	?
First	of	all	,	how	good	is	it	?	Well	,	it	's	pretty	good	.	It	is	n't	perfect	,	but	it	's	much	,	much	better	than	you	would	expect	,	given	our	 complete 	 ly 	 	chaotic	model	.
So	when	you	saw	him	make	a	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	edit	to	the	page	about	me	,	you	think	,	oh	,	this	is	 obvious 	 ly 	 	just	going	to	degenerate	into	rubbish	.
But	when	we	've	seen	quality	tests	--	and	there	have	n't	been	enough	of	these	yet	and	I	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 encourag 	 ing 	 	people	to	do	more	,	 compar 	 ing 	 	Wikipedia	to	traditional	things	--	we	win	hands	down	.
So	a	German	magazine	compared	German	Wikipedia	,	which	is	 re 	 ally 	 	much	,	much	 small 	 er 	 	than	English	,	to	Microsoft	 Encar 	 ta 	 	and	to	 Brock 	 haus 	 	Multimedia	,	and	we	won	across	the	board	.
They	hired	experts	to	come	and	look	at	articles	and	compare	the	quality	,	and	we	were	very	 please 	 d 	 	with	that	result	.
So	a	lot	of	people	have	heard	about	the	Wikipedia	 Bush 	 - 	 Kerry 	 	controversy	.
The	media	has	covered	this	somewhat	 extensive 	 ly 	 	.
It	started	out	with	an	article	in	Red	Herring	.
The	 reporter 	 s 	 	called	me	up	and	they	--	I	mean	,	I	have	to	say	they	spelled	my	name	right	,	but	they	 re 	 ally 	 	wanted	to	say	,	the	 Bush 	 - 	 Kerry 	 	election	is	so	 content 	 ious 	 	,	it	's	 tear 	 ing 	 	apart	the	Wikipedia	community	.	And	so	they	quote	me	as	saying	,	``	They	're	the	most	 content 	 ious 	 	in	the	history	of	Wikipedia	.	''
What	I	actually	said	is	,	they	're	not	 content 	 ious 	 	at	all	.
So	it	's	a	 s 	 light 	 	 mis 	 quote 	 	.	The	articles	were	edited	quite	heavily	.
And	it	is	true	that	we	did	have	to	lock	the	articles	on	a	couple	of	 occasion 	 s 	 	.
Time	magazine	 recent 	 ly 	 	reported	that	``	Extreme	action	sometimes	has	to	be	taken	,	and	Wales	locked	the	entries	on	Kerry	and	Bush	for	most	of	2004	.	''
This	came	after	I	told	the	reporter	that	we	had	to	lock	it	for	--	 occasion 	 ally 	 	a	little	bit	here	and	there	.
So	the	truth	in	general	is	that	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	controversies	that	you	would	probably	think	we	have	within	the	Wikipedia	community	are	not	 re 	 ally 	 	controversies	at	all	.
Articles	on	 controversia 	 l 	 	topics	are	edited	a	lot	,	but	they	do	n't	cause	much	controversy	within	the	community	.
And	the	reason	for	this	is	that	most	people	understand	the	need	for	neutrality	.
The	real	struggle	is	not	between	the	right	and	the	left	--	that	's	where	most	people	assume	--	but	it	's	between	the	party	of	the	 thought 	 ful 	 	and	the	party	of	the	 jerk 	 s 	 	.
And	no	side	of	the	political	spectrum	has	a	 mono 	 poly 	 	on	either	of	those	qualities	.
The	actual	truth	about	the	specific	 Bush 	 - 	 Kerry 	 	incident	is	that	the	 Bush 	 - 	 Kerry 	 	articles	were	locked	less	than	one	percent	of	the	time	in	2004	,	and	it	was	n't	because	they	were	 content 	 ious 	 	;	it	was	just	because	there	was	routine	 vandal 	 ism 	 	--	which	 happen 	 s 	 	sometimes	even	on	stage	,	people	--	sometimes	even	 reporter 	 s 	 	have	reported	to	me	that	they	 vandal 	 ize 	 	Wikipedia	and	were	 amaz 	 ed 	 	that	it	was	fixed	so	quickly	.
And	I	said	--	you	know	,	I	always	say	,	please	do	n't	do	that	;	that	's	not	a	good	thing	.
So	how	do	we	do	this	?
How	do	we	manage	the	quality	control	?
How	does	it	work	?
So	there	's	a	few	elements	,	mostly	social	policies	and	some	elements	of	the	software	.
So	the	biggest	and	the	most	important	thing	is	our	neutral	 point 	 - 	 of 	 - 	 view 	 	policy	.
This	is	something	that	I	set	down	from	the	very	beginning	,	as	a	core	principle	of	the	community	that	's	 complete 	 ly 	 	not	 debat 	 able 	 	.
It	's	a	social	concept	of	cooperation	,	so	we	do	n't	talk	a	lot	about	truth	and	 objectiv 	 ity 	 	.
The	reason	for	this	is	if	we	say	we	're	only	going	to	write	the	``	truth	''	about	some	topic	,	that	does	n't	do	us	a	damn	bit	of	good	of	figuring	out	what	to	write	,	because	I	do	n't	agree	with	you	about	what	's	the	truth	.
But	we	have	this	jargon	term	of	neutrality	,	which	has	its	own	long	history	within	the	community	,	which	 bas 	 ically 	 	says	,	any	time	there	's	a	 controversia 	 l 	 	issue	,	Wikipedia	itself	should	not	take	a	stand	on	the	issue	.
We	should	 mere 	 ly 	 	report	on	what	reputable	parties	have	said	about	it	.
So	this	neutrality	policy	is	 re 	 ally 	 	important	for	us	,	because	it	 empower 	 s 	 	a	community	that	is	very	diverse	to	come	together	and	actually	get	some	work	done	.
So	we	have	very	diverse	 contributor 	 s 	 	in	terms	of	political	,	religious	,	cultural	 background 	 s 	 	.
By	having	this	firm	neutrality	policy	,	which	is	 non 	 - 	 negoti 	 able 	 	from	the	beginning	,	we	ensure	that	people	can	work	together	and	that	the	entries	do	n't	become	simply	a	war	back	and	forth	between	the	left	and	the	right	.
If	you	engage	in	that	type	of	behavior	,	you	'll	be	asked	to	leave	the	community	.
So	 real 	 - 	 time 	 	peer	review	.
Every	single	change	on	the	site	goes	to	the	recent	changes	page	.
So	as	soon	as	he	made	his	change	,	it	went	to	the	recent	changes	page	.
That	recent	changes	page	was	also	fed	into	IRC	channel	,	which	is	an	Internet	chat	channel	that	people	are	monitoring	with	various	software	tools	.
And	people	can	get	RSS	feeds	--	they	can	get	 e 	 - 	 mail 	 	 notification 	 s 	 	of	changes	.
And	then	users	can	set	up	their	own	personal	watch	list	.
So	my	page	is	on	quite	a	few	volunteers	'	watch	lists	,	because	it	is	sometimes	 vandal 	 ized 	 	.
And	therefore	,	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	someone	will	notice	the	change	very	quickly	,	and	then	they	'll	just	simply	revert	the	change	.
There	's	a	new	pages	feed	,	for	example	,	so	you	can	go	to	a	certain	page	of	Wikipedia	and	see	every	new	page	as	it	's	created	.
This	is	 re 	 ally 	 	important	,	because	a	lot	of	new	pages	that	get	created	are	just	garbage	that	have	to	be	 delete 	 d 	 	,	you	know	,	 ASDF 	 ASDF 	 	.
But	also	that	's	some	of	the	most	 interest 	 ing 	 	and	fun	things	at	Wikipedia	,	some	of	the	new	articles	.
People	will	start	an	article	on	some	 interest 	 ing 	 	topic	,	other	people	will	find	that	 i 	 ntriguing 	 	and	jump	in	and	help	and	make	it	much	better	.
So	we	do	have	 edit 	 s 	 	by	anonymous	users	,	which	is	one	of	the	most	 controversia 	 l 	 	and	 i 	 ntriguing 	 	things	about	Wikipedia	.
So	Chris	was	able	to	do	his	change	--	he	did	n't	have	to	log	in	or	anything	;	he	just	went	on	the	website	and	made	a	change	.
But	it	turns	out	that	only	about	18	percent	of	all	the	 edit 	 s 	 	to	the	website	are	done	by	anonymous	users	.
And	that	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	important	thing	to	understand	,	is	that	the	vast	majority	of	the	 edit 	 s 	 	that	go	on	on	the	website	are	from	a	very	 close 	 - 	 knit 	 	community	of	maybe	600	to	1,000	people	who	are	in	constant	communication	.
And	we	have	over	40	IRC	channels	,	40	 mail 	 ing 	 	lists	.
All	these	people	know	each	other	.	They	communicate	;	we	have	 off 	 line 	 	meetings	.
These	are	the	people	who	are	 do 	 ing 	 	the	bulk	of	the	site	,	and	they	are	,	in	a	sense	,	 semi 	 - 	 professionals 	 	at	what	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	,	that	the	standards	we	set	for	 our 	 selves 	 	are	equal	to	or	higher	than	professional	standards	of	quality	.
We	do	n't	always	meet	those	standards	,	but	that	's	what	we	're	 striv 	 ing 	 	for	.
And	so	that	tight	community	is	who	 re 	 ally 	 	 care 	 s 	 	for	the	site	,	and	these	are	some	of	the	 smart 	 est 	 	people	I	've	ever	met	.
Of	course	,	it	's	my	job	to	say	that	,	but	it	's	actually	true	.
The	type	of	people	who	were	drawn	to	writing	an	encyclopedia	for	fun	tend	to	be	pretty	smart	people	.
The	tools	and	the	software	:	there	's	lots	of	tools	that	allow	us	--	allow	us	,	meaning	the	community	--	to	 self 	 - 	 monitor 	 	and	to	monitor	all	the	work	.
This	is	an	example	of	a	page	history	on	``	flat	earth	,	''	and	you	can	see	some	changes	that	were	made	.
What	's	nice	about	this	page	is	you	can	 immediate 	 ly 	 	take	a	look	at	this	and	see	,	oh	OK	,	I	understand	now	.
When	 some 	 body 	 	goes	and	looks	at	--	they	see	that	someone	,	an	anonymous	IP	number	,	made	an	edit	to	my	page	--	that	sounds	 suspicio 	 us 	 	--	who	is	this	person	?	 Some 	 body 	 	looks	at	it	--	they	can	 immediate 	 ly 	 	see	 highlight 	 ed 	 	in	red	all	of	the	changes	that	took	place	,	to	see	,	OK	,	well	,	these	words	have	changed	,	things	like	this	.
So	that	's	one	tool	that	we	can	use	to	very	quickly	monitor	the	history	of	a	page	.
Another	thing	that	we	do	within	the	community	is	we	leave	everything	very	 open 	 - 	 ended 	 	.
Most	of	the	social	rules	and	the	methods	of	work	are	left	 complete 	 ly 	 	 open 	 - 	 ended 	 	in	the	software	.
All	of	that	stuff	is	just	on	Wiki	pages	.
And	so	there	's	nothing	in	the	software	that	 enforce 	 s 	 	the	rules	.
The	example	I	've	got	up	here	is	a	Votes	For	Deletion	page	.
So	,	I	mentioned	earlier	,	people	type	 ASDF 	 ASDF 	 	--	it	needs	to	be	 delete 	 d 	 	.	Cases	like	that	,	the	 administrator 	 s 	 	just	delete	it	.
There	's	no	reason	to	have	a	big	argument	about	it	.
But	you	can	imagine	there	's	a	lot	of	other	areas	where	the	question	is	,	is	this	notable	enough	to	go	in	an	encyclopedia	?
Is	the	information	 veri 	 fiable 	 	?	Is	it	a	hoax	?	Is	it	true	?	Is	it	what	?
So	we	needed	a	social	method	for	figuring	out	the	answer	to	this	.
And	so	the	method	that	 a 	 rose 	 	 organic 	 ally 	 	within	the	community	is	the	Votes	For	Deletion	page	.
And	in	the	particular	example	we	have	here	,	it	's	a	film	,	``	Twisted	Issues	,	''	and	the	first	person	says	,	``	Now	this	is	 suppos 	 edly 	 	a	film	.	It	 fail 	 s 	 	the	Google	test	 miser 	 ably 	 	.	''
The	Google	test	is	,	you	look	in	Google	and	see	if	it	's	there	,	because	if	something	's	not	even	in	Google	,	it	probably	does	n't	exist	at	all	.
It	's	not	a	perfect	rule	,	but	it	's	a	nice	starting	point	for	quick	research	.
So	 some 	 body 	 	says	,	``	Delete	it	,	please	.	Delete	it	--	it	's	not	notable	.	''
And	then	 some 	 body 	 	says	,	``	Wait	,	wait	,	wait	,	wait	,	I	found	it	.
I	found	it	in	a	book	,	'Film	Threat	Video	Guide	:	the	20	Underground	Films	You	Must	See	.	'	''	Oh	,	OK	.	So	the	next	persons	says	,	``	Clean	it	up	.	''
 Some 	 body 	 	says	,	``	I	've	found	it	on	IMDB	.	Keep	,	keep	,	keep	.	''
And	what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	about	this	is	that	the	software	is	--	these	votes	are	just	--	they	're	just	text	typed	into	a	page	.
This	is	not	 re 	 ally 	 	a	vote	so	much	as	it	is	a	dialogue	.
Now	it	is	true	that	at	the	end	of	the	day	an	administrator	can	go	through	here	and	take	a	look	at	this	and	say	,	OK	,	18	 delete 	 s 	 	,	two	keeps	:	we	'll	delete	it	.
But	in	other	cases	,	this	could	be	18	 delete 	 s 	 	and	two	keeps	,	and	we	would	keep	it	,	because	if	those	last	two	keeps	say	,	``	Wait	a	minute	,	wait	a	minute	.
Nobody	else	saw	this	but	I	found	it	in	a	book	,	and	I	found	a	link	to	a	page	that	describes	it	,	and	I	'm	going	to	clean	it	up	tomorrow	,	so	please	do	n't	delete	it	,	''	then	it	would	survive	.
And	it	also	matters	who	the	people	are	who	are	voting	.
Like	I	say	,	it	's	a	tight	knit	community	.
Down	here	at	the	bottom	,	``	Keep	,	real	movie	,	''	Rick	Kay	.
Rick	Kay	is	a	very	famous	 Wikipedia 	 n 	 	who	does	an	 e 	 normous 	 	amount	of	work	with	 vandal 	 ism 	 	,	 hoax 	 es 	 	and	votes	for	deletion	.
His	voice	carries	a	lot	of	weight	within	the	community	because	he	knows	what	he	's	 do 	 ing 	 	.
So	how	's	all	this	 govern 	 ed 	 	?
People	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	know	about	,	OK	,	 administrator 	 s 	 	,	things	like	that	.
So	the	Wikipedia	governance	model	,	the	governance	of	the	community	,	is	a	very	 confus 	 ing 	 	,	but	a	 work 	 able 	 	mix	of	consensus	--	meaning	we	try	not	to	vote	on	the	content	of	articles	,	because	the	majority	view	is	not	 necessar 	 ily 	 	neutral	.
Some	amount	of	democracy	,	all	of	the	 administrator 	 s 	 	--	these	are	the	people	who	have	the	ability	to	delete	pages	,	that	does	n't	mean	that	they	have	the	right	to	delete	pages	;	they	still	have	to	follow	all	the	rules	--	but	they	're	elected	;	they	're	elected	by	the	community	.	Sometimes	people	--	random	 troll 	 s 	 	on	the	Internet	--	like	to	accuse	me	of	 hand 	 picking 	 	the	 administrator 	 s 	 	to	bias	the	content	of	the	encyclopedia	.
I	always	laugh	at	this	,	because	I	have	no	idea	how	they	're	elected	,	actually	.
There	's	a	certain	amount	of	 arist 	 ocracy 	 	.
And	so	you	've	got	a	hint	of	that	when	I	mentioned	,	like	,	Rick	Kay	's	voice	would	carry	a	lot	more	weight	than	someone	we	do	n't	know	.
I	give	this	talk	sometimes	with	Angela	,	who	was	just	 re 	 - 	 elected 	 	to	the	Board	from	the	community	--	to	the	Board	of	the	Foundation	,	with	more	than	twice	the	votes	of	the	person	who	did	n't	make	it	.
And	I	always	embarrass	her	because	I	say	,	well	,	Angela	,	for	example	,	could	get	away	with	 do 	 ing 	 	 absolute 	 ly 	 	anything	within	Wikipedia	,	because	she	's	so	 admir 	 ed 	 	and	so	powerful	.
But	the	 iron 	 y 	 	is	,	of	course	,	that	Angela	can	do	this	because	she	's	the	one	person	who	you	know	would	never	,	ever	,	ever	break	any	rules	of	Wikipedia	.
And	I	also	like	to	say	she	's	the	only	person	who	actually	knows	all	the	rules	of	Wikipedia	,	so	...
And	then	there	's	 monarch 	 y 	 	and	that	's	my	role	on	the	community	,	so	...
I	was	 describ 	 ing 	 	this	in	Berlin	once	and	the	next	day	in	the	newspaper	the	headline	said	,	``	I	am	the	Queen	of	England	.	''
And	that	's	not	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	I	said	,	but	--	the	point	is	my	role	in	the	community	--	within	the	free	software	world	there	's	been	a	 long 	 standing 	 	tradition	of	the	``	benevolent	dictator	''	model	.
So	if	you	look	at	most	of	the	major	free	software	projects	,	they	have	one	single	person	in	charge	who	everyone	 agree 	 s 	 	is	the	benevolent	dictator	.
Well	,	I	do	n't	like	the	term	``	benevolent	dictator	,	''	and	I	do	n't	think	that	it	's	my	job	or	my	role	in	the	world	of	ideas	to	be	the	dictator	of	the	future	of	all	human	knowledge	compiled	by	the	world	.
It	just	is	n't	appropriate	.
But	there	is	a	need	still	for	a	certain	amount	of	 monarch 	 y 	 	,	a	certain	amount	of	--	sometimes	we	have	to	make	a	decision	,	and	we	do	n't	want	to	get	 bogg 	 ed 	 	down	too	heavily	in	formal	 decision 	 - 	 making 	 	processes	.
So	as	an	example	of	why	this	has	been	--	or	how	this	can	be	important	:	we	 recent 	 ly 	 	had	a	situation	where	a	 neo 	 - 	 Nazi 	 	website	discovered	Wikipedia	,	and	they	said	,	``	Oh	,	well	,	this	is	 h 	 orrible 	 	,	this	Jewish	conspiracy	of	a	website	and	we	're	going	to	get	certain	articles	 delete 	 d 	 	that	we	do	n't	like	.
And	we	see	they	have	a	voting	process	,	so	we	're	going	to	send	--	we	have	40,000	members	and	we	're	going	to	send	them	over	and	they	're	all	going	to	vote	and	get	these	pages	 delete 	 d 	 	.	''
Well	,	they	managed	to	get	18	people	to	show	up	.
That	's	 neo 	 - 	 Nazi 	 	math	for	you	.
They	always	think	they	've	got	40,000	members	when	they	've	got	18	.
But	they	managed	to	get	18	people	to	come	and	vote	in	a	 fair 	 ly 	 	absurd	way	to	delete	a	 perfect 	 ly 	 	valid	article	.
Of	course	,	the	vote	ended	up	being	about	85	to	18	,	so	there	was	no	real	danger	to	our	democratic	processes	.
On	the	other	hand	,	people	said	,	``	But	what	are	we	going	to	do	?
I	mean	,	this	could	happen	and	what	if	some	group	 get 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 serious 	 ly 	 	organized	and	comes	in	and	 want 	 s 	 	to	vote	?	''
Then	I	said	,	``	Well	fuck	it	,	we	'll	just	change	the	rules	.	''
That	's	my	job	in	the	community	:	to	say	we	wo	n't	allow	our	 open 	 ness 	 	and	freedom	to	 under 	 mine 	 	the	quality	of	the	content	.
And	so	as	long	as	people	trust	me	in	my	role	,	then	that	's	a	valid	place	for	me	.
Of	course	,	because	of	the	free	licensing	,	if	I	do	a	bad	job	,	the	volunteers	are	more	than	happy	to	take	and	leave	--	I	ca	n't	tell	 any 	 one 	 	what	to	do	.
So	the	final	point	here	is	that	to	understand	how	Wikipedia	works	,	it	's	important	to	understand	that	our	Wiki	model	is	the	way	we	work	,	but	we	are	not	 fanatic 	 al 	 	web	 anarchist 	 s 	 	.	In	fact	,	we	're	very	flexible	about	the	social	methodology	,	because	it	's	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	the	passion	of	the	community	is	for	the	quality	of	the	work	,	not	 necessar 	 ily 	 	for	the	process	that	we	use	to	generate	it	.
Thank	you	.
Ben	Saunders	:	Yeah	,	hi	,	Ben	Saunders	.
Jimmy	,	you	mentioned	 impartial 	 ity 	 	being	a	key	to	Wikipedia	's	success	.
It	strikes	me	that	much	of	the	 textbook 	 s 	 	that	are	used	to	educate	our	children	are	 inhere 	 ntly 	 	biased	.
Have	you	found	Wikipedia	being	used	by	teachers	,	and	how	do	you	see	Wikipedia	changing	education	?
Jimmy	Wales	:	Yeah	,	so	,	a	lot	of	teachers	are	beginning	to	use	Wikipedia	.
There	's	a	media	storyline	about	Wikipedia	,	which	I	think	is	false	.
It	 build 	 s 	 	on	the	storyline	of	bloggers	versus	 newspaper 	 s 	 	.
And	the	storyline	is	,	there	's	this	crazy	thing	,	Wikipedia	,	but	 academic 	 s 	 	hate	it	and	teachers	hate	it	.	And	that	turns	out	to	not	be	true	.
The	last	time	I	got	an	 e 	 - 	 mail 	 	from	a	journalist	saying	,	``	Why	do	 academic 	 s 	 	hate	Wikipedia	?	''
I	sent	it	from	my	Harvard	email	address	,	because	I	was	 recent 	 ly 	 	appointed	a	fellow	there	.
And	I	said	,	``	Well	,	they	do	n't	all	hate	it	.	''
But	I	think	there	's	going	to	be	huge	 impact 	 s 	 	.
And	we	actually	have	a	project	that	I	'm	 personal 	 ly 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	excited	about	,	which	is	the	Wiki	books	project	,	which	is	an	effort	to	create	 textbook 	 s 	 	in	all	the	languages	.
And	that	's	a	much	 bigg 	 er 	 	project	;	it	's	going	to	take	20	years	or	so	to	come	to	 fruit 	 ion 	 	.
But	part	of	that	is	to	fulfill	our	mission	of	giving	an	encyclopedia	to	every	single	person	on	the	planet	.
We	do	n't	mean	we	're	going	to	spam	them	with	 AOL 	 - 	 style 	 	 CD 	 s 	 	.
We	mean	we	're	going	to	give	them	a	tool	that	they	can	use	.
And	for	a	lot	of	people	in	the	world	,	if	I	give	you	an	encyclopedia	that	's	written	at	a	university	level	,	it	does	n't	do	you	any	good	without	a	whole	host	of	literacy	materials	to	build	you	up	to	the	point	where	you	can	actually	use	it	.
And	so	the	Wiki	books	project	is	an	effort	to	do	that	.
And	I	think	that	we	're	going	to	 re 	 ally 	 	see	a	huge	--	it	may	not	even	come	from	us	;	there	's	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	innovation	going	on	.
But	 free 	 ly 	 	licensed	 textbook 	 s 	 	are	the	next	big	thing	in	education	.

Brewster	Kahle	 build 	 s 	 	a	free	digital	library
We	 re 	 ally 	 	need	to	put	the	best	we	have	to	offer	within	reach	of	our	children	.
If	we	do	n't	do	that	,	we	're	going	to	get	the	generation	we	 de 	 serve 	 	.
They	're	going	to	learn	from	whatever	it	is	they	have	around	them	.
And	we	,	as	now	the	elite	,	parents	,	 librarian 	 s 	 	,	professionals	,	whatever	it	is	,	a	bunch	of	our	activities	are	,	in	fact	,	in	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	the	best	we	have	to	offer	within	reach	of	those	around	us	,	or	as	 broad 	 ly 	 	as	we	can	.
I	'm	going	to	start	and	end	this	talk	with	a	couple	things	that	are	carved	in	stone	.
One	is	what	's	on	the	Boston	Public	Library	.
Carved	above	their	door	is	,	``	Free	to	All	.	''
It	's	kind	of	an	 inspir 	 ing 	 	statement	,	and	I	'll	go	back	at	the	end	of	this	.
I	'm	a	librarian	,	and	what	I	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	is	bring	all	of	the	works	of	knowledge	to	as	many	people	as	want	to	read	it	.
And	the	idea	of	 us 	 ing 	 	technology	is	perfect	for	us	.
I	think	we	have	the	opportunity	to	 one 	 - 	 up 	 	the	 Greek 	 s 	 	.
It	's	not	easy	to	 one 	 - 	 up 	 	the	 Greek 	 s 	 	.	But	with	the	 industri 	 ousness 	 	of	the	 Egyptian 	 s 	 	,	they	were	able	to	build	the	Library	of	Alexandria	--	the	idea	of	a	copy	of	every	book	of	all	the	 people 	 s 	 	of	the	world	.
The	problem	was	you	actually	had	to	go	to	Alexandria	to	go	to	it	.
On	the	other	hand	,	if	you	did	,	then	great	things	happened	.
I	think	we	can	 one 	 - 	 up 	 	the	 Greek 	 s 	 	and	achieve	something	.
And	I	'm	going	to	try	to	argue	only	one	point	today	:	that	universal	access	to	all	knowledge	is	within	our	grasp	.
So	if	I	'm	successful	,	then	you	'll	actually	come	away	thinking	,	yeah	,	we	could	actually	achieve	the	great	vision	of	everything	ever	published	,	everything	that	was	ever	meant	for	distribution	,	available	to	 any 	 body 	 	in	the	world	that	's	ever	wanted	to	have	access	to	it	.
Yes	,	there	's	issues	about	how	money	should	be	distributed	,	and	that	's	still	being	 re 	 figured 	 	out	.
But	I	'd	say	there	's	plenty	of	money	,	and	there	's	plenty	of	demand	,	so	we	can	actually	achieve	that	.
But	I	'm	going	to	go	over	the	technological	,	social	and	sort	of	where	are	we	as	a	whole	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	to	that	particular	vision	.
And	the	way	I	'm	going	to	try	to	do	this	is	do	it	like	the	Amazon.com	website	,	the	books	,	music	,	video	and	just	go	step	--	media	type	by	media	type	,	just	go	and	say	,	all	right	,	how	're	we	 do 	 ing 	 	on	this	?
So	if	we	start	with	books	,	you	know	,	sort	of	where	are	we	?
Well	,	first	you	have	to	,	as	an	engineer	,	scope	the	problem	.	How	big	is	it	?
If	you	wanted	to	put	all	of	the	published	works	online	so	that	 any 	 body 	 	could	have	it	available	,	well	,	how	big	a	problem	is	it	?
Well	,	we	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	know	,	but	the	largest	print	library	in	the	world	is	the	Library	of	Congress	.	It	's	26	million	volumes	,	26	million	volumes	.
It	is	,	by	far	and	away	,	the	largest	print	library	in	the	world	.
And	a	book	,	if	you	had	a	book	,	is	about	a	 mega 	 byte 	 	,	so	--	you	know	,	if	you	had	it	in	Microsoft	Word	.
So	a	 mega 	 byte 	 	,	26	million	 mega 	 bytes 	 	is	26	 tera 	 bytes 	 	--	it	goes	 mega 	 - 	 	,	 giga 	 - 	 	,	 tera 	 - 	 	.	26	 tera 	 bytes 	 	.
26	 tera 	 bytes 	 	fits	in	a	computer	system	that	's	about	this	big	,	on	spinning	Linux	drives	,	and	it	costs	about	60,000	dollars	.
So	for	the	cost	of	a	house	--	or	around	here	,	a	garage	--	you	can	put	,	you	can	have	spinning	all	of	the	words	in	the	Library	of	Congress	.
That	's	pretty	neat	.
Then	the	question	is	,	what	do	you	get	?
You	know	,	is	it	worth	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	there	?
Do	you	actually	want	it	online	?
Some	of	the	first	things	that	people	do	is	they	make	book	readers	that	allow	you	to	search	inside	the	books	,	and	that	's	kind	of	fun	.
And	you	can	download	these	things	,	and	look	around	them	in	new	and	different	ways	.
And	you	can	get	at	them	 remote 	 ly 	 	,	if	you	happen	to	have	a	laptop	.
There	's	starting	to	be	some	of	these	sort	of	page	 turn 	 - 	 y 	 	 interface 	 s 	 	that	look	a	whole	lot	like	books	in	certain	ways	,	and	you	can	search	them	,	make	little	tabs	,	and	it	's	kind	of	cute	--	still	very	 book 	 - 	 like 	 	--	on	your	laptop	.
But	I	do	n't	know	,	reading	things	on	a	laptop	--	whenever	I	pull	up	my	laptop	,	it	always	 feel 	 s 	 	like	work	.
I	think	that	's	one	of	the	reasons	why	the	Kindle	is	so	great	.
I	do	n't	have	to	feel	like	I	'm	at	work	to	read	a	Kindle	.
It	's	starting	to	be	a	little	bit	more	specified	.
But	I	have	to	say	that	there	's	older	technologies	that	I	tend	to	like	.
I	like	the	physical	book	.
And	I	think	we	can	go	and	use	our	technology	to	go	and	 digit 	 ize 	 	things	,	put	them	on	the	Net	,	and	then	download	,	print	them	and	bind	them	,	and	end	up	with	books	again	.
And	we	sort	of	said	,	well	,	how	hard	is	this	?
And	it	turns	out	to	not	be	very	hard	.
We	actually	went	off	to	make	a	 book 	 mobile 	 	.
And	a	 book 	 mobile 	 	--	the	size	of	a	van	with	a	satellite	dish	,	a	printer	,	binder	and	cutter	,	and	kids	make	their	own	books	.
It	costs	about	three	dollars	to	download	,	print	and	bind	a	normal	,	old	book	.
And	they	actually	come	out	kind	of	nice	looking	.
You	can	actually	get	 re 	 ally 	 	 good 	 - 	 looking 	 	books	for	on	the	order	of	one	penny	per	page	,	sort	of	the	parts	cost	for	 do 	 ing 	 	this	.
So	the	idea	of	--	this	technology	actually	may	end	up	putting	books	back	in	people	's	hands	again	.
There	are	some	other	 book 	 mobiles 	 	running	around	.
This	is	Eric	Eldred	making	books	at	Walden	Pond	--	 Thor 	 eau 	 	's	works	.
This	is	just	before	he	got	kicked	out	by	the	Parks	Services	,	for	 compet 	 ing 	 	with	the	bookstore	there	.
In	India	,	they	've	got	another	couple	 book 	 mobiles 	 	running	around	.
And	this	is	the	opening	day	at	the	Library	of	Alexandria	,	the	new	Library	of	Alexandria	,	in	Egypt	.
It	was	quite	 popular 	 ly 	 	attended	.
And	kids	starting	to	make	their	own	books	,	and	a	happy	kid	with	the	first	book	that	he	's	ever	owned	.
So	the	idea	of	being	able	to	use	this	technology	to	end	up	with	paper	where	I	can	handle	sort	of	sounds	a	little	retro	,	but	I	think	it	still	has	its	place	.
And	being	from	the	Silicon	Valley	,	sort	of	utopian	sort	of	world	,	we	thought	,	if	we	can	make	this	technology	work	in	rural	Uganda	,	we	might	have	something	.
So	we	actually	got	some	funding	from	the	World	Bank	to	try	it	out	.
And	we	found	in	about	30	days	we	could	go	and	take	a	couple	folks	from	Silicon	Valley	,	fly	them	to	Uganda	,	buy	a	car	,	set	up	the	first	Internet	connection	at	the	National	Library	of	Uganda	,	figure	out	what	they	wanted	,	and	get	a	program	going	making	books	in	rural	Uganda	.
And	it	actually	--	so	 technological 	 ly 	 	,	it	works	.
What	we	found	out	of	this	is	we	did	n't	have	the	right	books	.
So	the	books	were	in	the	library	.	We	could	get	it	to	people	,	if	they	're	 digit 	 ized 	 	,	but	we	did	n't	know	how	to	quite	get	them	 digit 	 ized 	 	.
Everybody	thought	the	answer	is	,	send	things	to	India	and	China	.
And	so	we	've	tried	that	,	and	I	'll	go	over	that	in	a	moment	.
There	are	some	 new 	 er 	 	technologies	for	 deliver 	 ing 	 	that	have	happened	that	are	actually	quite	 excit 	 ing 	 	as	well	.
One	is	a	 print 	 - 	 on 	 - 	 demand 	 	machine	that	looks	like	a	Rube	Goldberg	machine	.
We	have	one	of	these	things	now	.	It	's	 complete 	 ly 	 	cool	.
It	's	all	 convey 	 or 	 	belt	,	and	it	makes	a	book	.
And	it	's	called	the	``	Espresso	Book	Machine	,	''	and	in	about	10	minutes	,	you	can	press	a	button	and	make	a	book	.
Something	else	I	'm	quite	excited	about	in	this	particular	domain	,	beyond	these	sort	of	 kiosk 	 - 	 y 	 	things	where	you	can	get	books	on	demand	,	is	some	of	these	new	little	screens	that	are	coming	out	.
And	one	of	my	 favorit 	 es 	 	in	this	is	the	$	100	laptop	.
And	I	do	n't	mean	to	steal	any	thunder	here	,	but	we	've	gone	and	used	one	of	these	things	to	be	an	 e 	 - 	 book 	 	reader	.
So	here	's	one	of	the	beta	units	and	you	can	--	it	actually	turns	out	to	be	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 good 	 - 	 looking 	 	 e 	 - 	 book 	 	reader	.
And	we	have	a	quick	hack	that	we	did	to	try	to	put	one	of	our	books	on	it	,	and	it	turns	out	that	200	dots	per	inch	means	that	you	can	put	scanned	books	on	them	that	look	 re 	 ally 	 	good	.
At	200	dots	per	inch	,	it	's	kind	of	the	equivalent	of	a	300	dot	print	laser	printer	.
We	're	in	good	enough	shape	.
You	actually	can	go	and	read	scanned	books	quite	easily	.
So	the	idea	of	electronic	books	is	starting	to	come	about	.
But	how	do	you	go	about	 do 	 ing 	 	all	this	scanning	?
So	we	thought	,	okay	,	well	,	let	's	try	out	this	send	books	to	India	thing	.
And	there	was	a	project	with	,	funded	by	the	National	Science	Foundation	--	sent	a	bunch	of	scanners	,	and	the	American	libraries	were	 s 	 upposed 	 	to	send	books	.
Well	,	they	did	n't	.	They	did	n't	want	to	send	their	books	.
So	we	bought	100,000	books	and	sent	them	to	India	.
And	then	we	learned	why	you	do	n't	want	to	send	books	to	India	.
The	lesson	we	learned	out	of	this	is	,	scan	your	own	books	.
If	you	 re 	 ally 	 	care	about	books	,	you	're	going	to	scan	them	better	,	especially	if	they	're	valuable	books	.
If	they	're	new	books	and	you	can	just	,	you	know	,	butcher	them	,	because	you	could	just	buy	another	one	,	that	's	not	such	a	big	deal	in	terms	of	 do 	 ing 	 	 high 	 - 	 quality 	 	scanning	.
But	do	things	that	you	love	.
But	the	Indians	have	been	scanning	a	lot	of	their	own	books	--	about	300,000	now	--	 do 	 ing 	 	very	well	.
The	Chinese	did	over	a	million	,	and	the	 Egyptian 	 s 	 	are	about	30,000	.
But	we	sent	--	thought	,	OK	,	if	we	're	going	to	need	to	do	this	,	let	's	do	it	 in 	 - 	 library 	 	.
How	do	we	go	and	do	this	,	and	how	do	we	get	it	down	so	that	it	's	a	cost	point	that	we	could	afford	?
And	we	sort	of	picked	the	price	point	of	10	cents	a	page	.
If	it	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	the	cost	of	 xerox 	 ing 	 	to	 bas 	 ically 	 	 digit 	 ize 	 	,	OCR	,	package	it	up	,	make	it	so	that	you	could	download	,	print	and	bind	it	--	the	whole	 she 	 bang 	 	--	we	would	have	achieved	something	.
So	we	started	out	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	.	How	do	we	get	to	10	cents	?
And	we	tried	these	robot	things	,	and	they	worked	pretty	well	--	sort	of	these	 auto 	 - 	 page 	 - 	 turning 	 	things	.
If	we	can	have	Mars	Rovers	,	you	'd	think	you	could	turn	pages	.
But	it	actually	turns	out	to	be	pretty	hard	to	turn	pages	,	and	the	volume	is	n't	there	.
So	 any 	 way 	 	--	so	we	ended	up	making	our	own	book	scanner	,	and	with	two	digital	,	 high 	 - 	 grade 	 	,	professional	digital	cameras	,	controlled	museum	lighting	,	so	even	if	it	's	a	black	and	white	book	,	you	can	go	and	get	the	proper	intonation	.
So	you	 bas 	 ically 	 	do	a	beautiful	,	respectful	job	.
This	is	not	a	fax	,	this	is	--	the	idea	is	to	do	a	beautiful	job	as	you	're	going	through	these	libraries	.
And	we	've	been	able	to	achieve	10	cents	a	page	if	we	run	things	in	volume	.
This	is	what	it	looks	like	at	the	University	of	Toronto	.
And	actually	,	it	turns	out	to	,	you	know	,	pay	a	living	wage	.
People	seem	to	love	it	.
Yes	,	it	's	a	little	boring	,	but	some	people	kind	of	get	into	the	Zen	of	it	.
And	especially	if	it	's	kind	of	 interest 	 ing 	 	books	that	you	care	about	,	in	languages	that	you	can	read	.
We	actually	have	been	able	to	do	a	pretty	good	job	of	this	,	at	getting	10	cents	a	page	.
So	10	cents	a	page	,	300	pages	in	your	average	book	,	30	dollars	a	book	.
The	Library	of	Congress	,	if	you	did	the	whole	darn	thing	--	26	million	books	--	is	about	750	million	dollars	,	right	?
But	a	million	books	,	I	think	,	actually	would	be	a	pretty	good	start	,	and	that	would	cost	30	million	dollars	.	That	's	not	that	big	a	bill	.
And	what	we	've	been	able	to	do	is	get	into	libraries	.
We	've	now	got	eight	of	these	scanning	centers	in	three	countries	,	and	libraries	are	up	for	having	their	books	scanned	.
The	Getty	here	is	moving	their	books	to	the	UCLA	,	which	is	where	we	have	one	these	scanning	centers	,	and	scanning	their	 out 	 - 	 of 	 - 	 copyright 	 	books	,	which	is	fabulous	.
So	we	're	starting	to	get	the	institutional	responsibility	.
The	thing	we	're	missing	is	the	10	cents	.
If	we	can	get	the	10	cents	,	all	the	rest	of	it	flows	.
We	've	scanned	about	200,000	books	.
Now	we	're	scanning	about	15,000	books	a	month	,	and	it	's	starting	to	gear	up	another	factor	of	two	from	there	.
So	all	in	all	,	that	's	going	very	well	.
And	we	're	starting	to	move	out	of	the	just	 out 	 - 	 of 	 - 	 copyright 	 	into	the	 out 	 - 	 of 	 - 	 print 	 	world	.
So	I	think	of	--	we	're	kind	of	going	from	the	 out 	 - 	 of 	 - 	 copyright 	 	,	library	stuff	,	and	Amazon.com	is	coming	from	the	 in 	 - 	 print 	 	world	.
And	I	think	we	'll	meet	in	the	middle	some	place	,	and	have	the	classic	thing	that	you	have	,	which	is	a	publishing	system	and	a	library	system	working	in	parallel	.
And	so	we	're	starting	up	a	program	to	do	 out 	 - 	 of 	 - 	 print 	 	works	,	but	 loan 	 ing 	 	them	.
Exactly	what	 loan 	 ing 	 	means	,	I	'm	not	quite	sure	.
But	 any 	 way 	 	,	 loan 	 ing 	 	 out 	 - 	 of 	 - 	 print 	 	works	from	the	Boston	Public	Library	,	the	Woods	Hole	 Ocean 	 ographic 	 	Institute	and	a	few	other	libraries	that	are	starting	to	participate	in	this	program	,	to	try	out	this	model	of	where	does	a	library	stop	and	where	does	the	bookstore	take	over	.
So	all	in	all	,	it	's	possible	to	do	this	in	large	scale	.
We	're	also	going	back	over	 micro 	 film 	 	and	getting	that	online	.
So	,	we	can	do	10	cents	a	page	,	we	're	going	15,000	books	a	month	and	we	've	got	about	250,000	books	online	,	counting	all	the	other	projects	that	are	starting	to	add	in	.
So	what	I	wanted	to	argue	is	,	books	are	within	our	grasp	.
The	idea	of	taking	on	the	whole	ball	of	wax	is	not	that	big	a	deal	.
Yes	,	it	costs	tens	of	 million 	 s 	 	,	low	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	,	but	one	time	shot	and	we	've	got	 bas 	 ically 	 	the	history	of	printed	literature	online	.
And	then	,	there	's	business	model	issues	about	how	to	try	to	 effective 	 ly 	 	market	it	and	get	it	to	people	.
But	it	is	within	our	grasp	,	 technological 	 ly 	 	and	 law 	 - 	 wise 	 	,	at	least	for	the	out	of	print	and	out	of	copyright	,	we	suggest	,	to	be	able	to	get	the	whole	darn	thing	online	.
Now	let	's	go	for	audio	,	and	I	'm	going	to	go	through	these	.
So	how	much	is	there	?
Well	,	as	best	we	can	tell	,	there	are	about	two	to	three	million	disks	having	been	published	--	so	78s	,	 long 	 - 	 playing 	 	records	and	 CD 	 s 	 	--	or	at	least	that	's	the	largest	archives	of	published	materials	we	've	been	able	to	sort	of	point	at	.
It	costs	about	10	dollars	a	piece	to	go	and	take	a	disk	and	put	it	online	,	if	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	things	in	volume	.
But	we	've	found	that	the	rights	issues	are	 re 	 ally 	 	quite	 thorn 	 y 	 	.
This	is	a	 fair 	 ly 	 	heavily	 litigate 	 d 	 	area	,	so	we	've	found	that	there	are	 niche 	 s 	 	in	the	music	world	that	are	n't	served	 terri 	 bly 	 	well	by	the	classic	commercial	publishing	system	.
And	we	've	been	starting	to	make	these	available	by	going	and	offering	shelf	space	on	the	Net	.
In	the	United	States	,	it	does	n't	cost	you	to	give	something	away	.	Right	?
If	you	give	something	to	a	charity	or	to	the	public	,	you	get	a	pat	on	the	back	and	a	tax	donation	--	except	on	the	Net	,	where	you	can	go	broke	.
If	you	put	up	a	video	of	your	garage	band	,	and	it	starts	getting	heavily	 access 	 ed 	 	,	you	can	lose	your	guitars	or	your	house	.
This	does	n't	make	any	sense	.
So	we	've	offered	unlimited	storage	,	unlimited	 band 	 width 	 	,	forever	,	for	free	,	to	 any 	 body 	 	that	has	something	to	share	that	 belong 	 s 	 	in	a	library	.
And	we	've	been	getting	a	lot	of	takers	.	One	is	the	rock	'n	'	 roller 	 s 	 	.
The	rock	'n	'	 roller 	 s 	 	had	a	tradition	of	sharing	,	as	long	as	nobody	made	any	money	.	You	could	--	concert	recordings	,	it	's	not	the	commercial	recordings	,	but	concert	recordings	,	started	by	the	Grateful	Dead	.
And	we	get	about	two	or	three	bands	a	day	signing	up	.
They	give	permission	,	and	we	get	about	40	or	50	concerts	a	day	.
We	have	about	40,000	concerts	,	everything	the	Grateful	Dead	ever	did	,	up	on	the	Net	,	so	that	people	can	see	it	and	listen	to	this	material	.
So	audio	is	possible	to	put	up	,	but	the	rights	issues	are	 re 	 ally 	 	pretty	 thorn 	 y 	 	.
We	've	got	a	lot	of	collections	now	--	a	couple	hundred	thousand	items	--	and	it	's	growing	over	time	.
Moving	images	:	if	you	think	of	theatrical	releases	,	there	are	not	that	many	of	them	.
As	best	we	can	tell	,	there	are	about	150,000	to	200,000	movies	ever	that	are	 re 	 ally 	 	meant	for	a	 large 	 - 	 scale 	 	theatrical	distribution	.	It	's	just	not	that	many	.
But	half	of	those	were	Indian	.
But	 any 	 way 	 	,	it	's	 do 	 able 	 	,	but	we	've	only	found	about	a	thousand	of	these	things	that	--	to	be	out	of	copyright	.
So	we	've	 digit 	 ized 	 	those	and	made	those	available	.
But	we	've	found	that	there	's	lots	of	other	types	of	movies	that	have	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	seen	the	light	of	day	--	 archiv 	 al 	 	films	.
We	've	found	,	also	,	a	lot	of	political	films	,	a	lot	of	amateur	films	,	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	things	that	are	 bas 	 ically 	 	 need 	 ing 	 	a	home	,	a	permanent	home	.
So	we	've	been	starting	to	make	these	available	and	it	's	grown	to	be	very	popular	.
We	're	not	quite	a	YouTube	.
We	tended	towards	 long 	 er 	 - 	 term 	 	things	and	also	things	that	people	can	reuse	and	make	into	new	movies	,	which	has	just	been	great	fun	.
Television	comes	quite	a	bit	larger	.
We	started	recording	20	channels	of	television	24	hours	a	day	.
It	's	sort	of	the	biggest	TiVo	box	you	've	ever	seen	.
It	's	about	a	 peta 	 byte 	 	,	so	far	,	of	worldwide	television	--	Russian	,	Chinese	,	Japanese	,	Iraqi	,	Al	Jazeera	,	BBC	,	CNN	,	ABC	,	CBS	,	NBC	--	24	hours	a	day	.
We	only	put	one	week	up	,	which	is	mostly	for	cost	reasons	,	which	is	the	9/11	,	sort	of	from	9/11/2001	.	For	one	week	,	what	did	the	world	see	?
CNN	was	saying	that	 Palestinian 	 s 	 	were	dancing	in	the	streets	.
Were	they	?	Let	's	look	at	the	Palestinian	television	and	find	out	.
How	can	we	have	critical	thinking	without	being	able	to	quote	and	being	able	to	compare	what	happened	in	the	past	?
And	television	is	 dreadful 	 ly 	 	 un 	 recorded 	 	and	 un 	 quot 	 able 	 	,	except	by	Jon	Stewart	,	who	does	a	fabulous	job	.
So	 any 	 way 	 	,	television	is	,	I	would	suggest	,	within	our	grasp	.
So	15	dollars	per	video	hour	,	and	also	about	100	dollars	to	150	dollars	per	 cellulo 	 id 	 	hour	,	we	're	able	to	go	and	get	materials	online	very	 in 	 expensive 	 ly 	 	and	have	them	up	on	the	Net	.
And	we	've	got	,	now	,	a	lot	of	these	materials	.
So	we	've	got	about	100,000	pieces	up	there	.
So	books	,	music	,	video	,	software	.	There	's	only	50,000	titles	of	it	.
Mostly	the	issues	there	are	legal	issues	and	breaking	copy	 protection 	 s 	 	.
But	we	've	worked	through	some	of	those	,	but	we	've	still	got	real	problems	in	Washington	.
Well	,	we	're	best	known	as	the	World	Wide	Web	.
We	've	been	 archiv 	 ing 	 	the	World	Wide	Web	since	1996	.
We	take	a	snapshot	of	every	website	and	all	of	the	pages	on	it	,	every	two	months	.
And	actually	,	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	been	 pioneer 	 ed 	 	by	Alexa	Internet	,	which	 donate 	 s 	 	this	collection	to	the	Internet	Archive	.
And	it	's	been	growing	along	for	the	last	11	years	,	and	it	's	a	fantastic	resource	.
And	we	've	made	a	 Way 	 back 	 	Machine	that	you	can	then	go	and	see	old	 website 	 s 	 	kind	of	the	way	they	were	.
If	you	go	and	search	on	something	--	this	is	 Google 	 .com 	 	,	the	different	versions	of	it	that	we	have	,	this	is	what	it	looks	like	when	it	was	an	alpha	release	,	and	this	is	what	it	looked	like	at	Stanford	.
So	 any 	 way 	 	,	you	've	got	 bas 	 ically 	 	an	idea	of	where	things	came	from	.
Mostly	,	people	want	to	see	their	old	stuff	out	of	this	.
If	there	's	one	thing	that	we	want	to	learn	from	the	Library	of	Alexandria	version	one	,	which	is	probably	best	known	for	burning	,	is	,	do	n't	just	have	one	copy	.
So	we	've	started	to	--	we	've	made	another	copy	of	all	of	this	and	we	actually	put	it	back	in	the	Library	of	Alexandria	.
So	this	is	a	picture	of	the	Internet	Archive	at	the	Library	of	Alexandria	.
And	we	now	have	also	another	copy	building	up	in	Amsterdam	.
So	,	we	should	put	it	in	the	San	Andreas	Fault	Line	in	San	Francisco	,	flood	zone	in	Amsterdam	and	in	the	Middle	East	.	Right	,	so	 any 	 way 	 	...
so	we	're	hedging	our	bets	here	.
If	we	go	and	put	it	in	a	couple	more	places	,	I	think	we	'll	be	in	good	shape	.
There	's	a	political	and	social	question	out	of	this	.
Is	all	of	this	,	as	we	go	digital	,	is	it	going	to	be	public	or	private	?
There	's	some	large	companies	that	have	seen	this	vision	,	that	are	 do 	 ing 	 	 large 	 - 	 scale 	 	 digit 	 ization 	 	,	but	they	're	locking	up	the	public	domain	.
The	question	is	,	is	that	the	world	that	we	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	live	in	?
What	's	the	role	of	the	public	versus	the	private	as	things	go	forward	?
How	do	we	go	and	have	a	world	where	we	both	have	libraries	and	publishing	in	the	future	,	just	as	we	 bas 	 ically 	 	 benefit 	 ed 	 	as	we	were	growing	up	?
So	universal	access	to	all	knowledge	--	I	think	it	can	be	one	of	the	greatest	 achievement 	 s 	 	of	 human 	 kind 	 	,	like	the	man	on	the	moon	,	or	the	Gutenberg	Bible	,	or	the	Library	of	Alexandria	.
It	could	be	something	that	we	're	remembered	for	,	for	 millenni 	 a 	 	,	for	having	achieved	.
And	as	I	said	before	,	I	'll	end	with	something	that	's	carved	above	the	door	of	the	Carnegie	Library	.
Carnegie	--	one	of	the	great	 capitalist 	 s 	 	of	this	country	--	carved	above	his	legacy	,	``	Free	to	the	People	.	''
Thank	you	very	much	.

All	over	the	planet	,	giant	 telescope 	 s 	 	and	detectors	are	looking	for	clues	to	the	 working 	 s 	 	of	the	universe	.	At	the	INK	Conference	,	science	writer	Anil	 Anantha 	 swamy 	 	tours	us	around	these	amazing	 installation 	 s 	 	,	taking	us	to	some	of	the	most	remote	and	silent	places	on	Earth	.

Anil	 Anantha 	 swamy 	 	:	What	it	takes	to	do	extreme	 astro 	 physics 	 
I	would	like	to	talk	today	about	what	I	think	is	one	of	the	greatest	 adventure 	 s 	 	human	beings	have	 embark 	 ed 	 	upon	,	which	is	the	quest	to	understand	the	universe	and	our	place	in	it	.
My	own	interest	in	this	subject	,	and	my	passion	for	it	,	began	rather	 accidental 	 ly 	 	.
I	had	bought	a	copy	of	this	book	,	``	The	Universe	and	Dr.	Einstein	''	--	a	used	paperback	from	a	 second 	 hand 	 	bookstore	in	Seattle	.
A	few	years	after	that	,	in	Bangalore	,	I	was	finding	it	hard	to	fall	 a 	 sleep 	 	one	night	,	and	I	picked	up	this	book	,	thinking	it	would	put	me	to	sleep	in	10	minutes	.
And	as	it	happened	,	I	read	it	from	midnight	to	five	in	the	morning	in	one	shot	.
And	I	was	left	with	this	intense	feeling	of	awe	and	 exhila 	 ration 	 	at	the	universe	and	our	own	ability	to	understand	as	much	as	we	do	.
And	that	feeling	has	n't	left	me	yet	.
That	feeling	was	the	trigger	for	me	to	actually	change	my	career	--	from	being	a	software	engineer	to	become	a	science	writer	--	so	that	I	could	partake	in	the	joy	of	science	,	and	also	the	joy	of	communicating	it	to	others	.
And	that	feeling	also	led	me	to	a	pilgrimage	of	 sort 	 s 	 	,	to	go	literally	to	the	ends	of	the	earth	to	see	 telescope 	 s 	 	,	detectors	,	instruments	that	people	are	building	,	or	have	built	,	in	order	to	probe	the	cosmos	in	greater	and	greater	detail	.
So	it	took	me	from	places	like	Chile	--	the	Atacama	Desert	in	Chile	--	to	Siberia	,	to	underground	mines	in	the	Japanese	Alps	,	in	Northern	America	,	all	the	way	to	Antarctica	and	even	to	the	South	Pole	.
And	today	I	would	like	to	share	with	you	some	images	,	some	stories	of	these	trips	.
I	have	been	 bas 	 ically 	 	spending	the	last	few	years	 document 	 ing 	 	the	efforts	of	some	 extreme 	 ly 	 	intrepid	men	and	women	who	are	putting	,	literally	at	times	,	their	lives	at	stake	working	in	some	very	remote	and	very	 hostil 	 e 	 	places	so	that	they	may	gather	the	 fain 	 test 	 	signals	from	the	cosmos	in	order	for	us	to	understand	this	universe	.
And	I	first	begin	with	a	pie	chart	--	and	I	promise	this	is	the	only	pie	chart	in	the	whole	presentation	--	but	it	sets	up	the	state	of	our	knowledge	of	the	cosmos	.
All	the	theories	in	physics	that	we	have	today	properly	explain	what	is	called	normal	matter	--	the	stuff	that	we	're	all	made	of	--	and	that	's	four	percent	of	the	universe	.
 Astronomer 	 s 	 	and	 cosm 	 ologists 	 	and	 physicist 	 s 	 	think	that	there	is	something	called	dark	matter	in	the	universe	,	which	makes	up	23	percent	of	the	universe	,	and	something	called	dark	energy	,	which	 permeat 	 es 	 	the	fabric	of	 space 	 - 	 time 	 	,	that	makes	up	another	73	percent	.
So	if	you	look	at	this	pie	chart	,	96	percent	of	the	universe	,	at	this	point	in	our	exploration	of	it	,	is	unknown	or	not	well	understood	.
And	most	of	the	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	 telescope 	 s 	 	that	I	went	to	see	are	in	some	way	 address 	 ing 	 	this	question	,	these	two	twin	 mysterie 	 s 	 	of	dark	matter	and	dark	energy	.
I	will	take	you	first	to	an	underground	mine	in	Northern	Minnesota	where	people	are	looking	for	something	called	dark	matter	.
And	the	idea	here	is	that	they	are	looking	for	a	sign	of	a	dark	matter	particle	hitting	one	of	their	detectors	.
And	the	reason	why	they	have	to	go	underground	is	that	,	if	you	did	this	experiment	on	the	surface	of	the	Earth	,	the	same	experiment	would	be	 swamp 	 ed 	 	by	signals	that	could	be	created	by	things	like	cosmic	rays	,	ambient	radio	activity	,	even	our	own	bodies	.	You	might	not	believe	it	,	but	even	our	own	bodies	are	 radioactiv 	 e 	 	enough	to	disturb	this	experiment	.
So	they	go	deep	inside	mines	to	find	a	kind	of	environmental	silence	that	will	allow	them	to	hear	the	ping	of	a	dark	matter	particle	hitting	their	detector	.
And	I	went	to	see	one	of	these	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	and	this	is	actually	--	you	can	 bare 	 ly 	 	see	it	,	and	the	reason	for	that	is	it	's	 entire 	 ly 	 	dark	in	there	--	this	is	a	cavern	that	was	left	behind	by	the	miners	who	left	this	mine	in	1960	.
And	 physicist 	 s 	 	came	and	started	 us 	 ing 	 	it	 some 	 time 	 	in	the	1980s	.
And	the	miners	in	the	early	part	of	the	last	century	worked	,	literally	,	in	 candle 	 light 	 	.
And	today	,	you	would	see	this	inside	the	mine	,	half	a	mile	underground	.
This	is	one	of	the	largest	underground	labs	in	the	world	.
And	,	among	other	things	,	they	're	looking	for	dark	matter	.
There	is	another	way	to	search	for	dark	matter	,	which	is	 in 	 directly 	 	.
If	dark	matter	exists	in	our	universe	,	in	our	galaxy	,	then	these	particles	should	be	 smash 	 ing 	 	together	and	producing	other	particles	that	we	know	about	--	one	of	them	being	 neutrino 	 s 	 	.
And	 neutrino 	 s 	 	you	can	detect	by	the	signature	they	leave	when	they	hit	water	molecules	.
When	a	neutrino	hits	a	water	molecule	it	 emit 	 s 	 	a	kind	of	blue	light	,	a	flash	of	blue	light	,	and	by	looking	for	this	blue	light	,	you	can	 essential 	 ly 	 	understand	something	about	the	neutrino	and	then	,	 in 	 directly 	 	,	something	about	the	dark	matter	that	might	have	created	this	neutrino	.
But	you	need	very	,	very	large	volumes	of	water	in	order	to	do	this	.
You	need	something	like	tens	of	 mega 	 tons 	 	of	water	--	almost	a	 giga 	 ton 	 	of	water	--	in	order	to	have	any	chance	of	catching	this	neutrino	.
And	where	in	the	world	would	you	find	such	water	?
Well	the	 Russian 	 s 	 	have	a	tank	in	their	own	backyard	.
This	is	Lake	Baikal	.
It	is	the	largest	lake	in	the	world	.	It	's	800	km	long	.
It	's	about	40	to	50	km	wide	in	most	places	,	and	one	to	two	kilometers	deep	.
And	what	the	 Russian 	 s 	 	are	 do 	 ing 	 	is	they	're	building	these	detectors	and	 immers 	 ing 	 	them	about	a	kilometer	beneath	the	surface	of	the	lake	so	that	they	can	watch	for	these	flashes	of	blue	light	.
And	this	is	the	scene	that	 greet 	 ed 	 	me	when	I	 land 	 ed 	 	there	.
This	is	Lake	Baikal	in	the	peak	of	the	Siberian	winter	.
The	lake	is	 entire 	 ly 	 	frozen	.
And	the	line	of	black	dots	that	you	see	in	the	background	,	that	's	the	ice	camp	where	the	 physicist 	 s 	 	are	working	.
The	reason	why	they	have	to	work	in	winter	is	because	they	do	n't	have	the	money	to	work	in	summer	and	spring	,	which	,	if	they	did	that	,	they	would	need	ships	and	 submersible 	 s 	 	to	do	their	work	.
So	they	wait	until	winter	--	the	lake	is	 complete 	 ly 	 	frozen	over	--	and	they	use	this	 meter 	 - 	 thick 	 	ice	as	a	platform	on	which	to	establish	their	ice	camp	and	do	their	work	.
So	this	is	the	 Russian 	 s 	 	working	on	the	ice	in	the	peak	of	the	Siberian	winter	.
They	have	to	drill	holes	in	the	ice	,	dive	down	into	the	water	--	cold	,	cold	water	--	to	get	hold	of	the	instrument	,	bring	it	up	,	do	any	 repair 	 s 	 	and	maintenance	that	they	need	to	do	,	put	it	back	and	get	out	before	the	ice	melts	.
Because	that	phase	of	solid	ice	 last 	 s 	 	for	two	months	and	it	's	full	of	cracks	.
And	you	have	to	imagine	,	there	's	an	entire	 sea 	 - 	 like 	 	lake	I	still	do	n't	understand	this	one	Russian	man	working	in	his	bare	chest	,	but	that	 tell 	 s 	 	you	how	hard	he	was	working	.
And	these	people	,	a	 hand 	 ful 	 	of	people	,	have	been	working	for	20	years	,	looking	for	particles	that	may	or	may	not	exist	.
And	they	have	dedicated	their	lives	to	it	.
And	just	to	give	you	an	idea	,	they	have	spent	20	million	over	20	years	.
It	's	very	harsh	conditions	.
They	work	on	a	 shoe 	 string 	 	budget	.
The	 toilet 	 s 	 	there	are	literally	holes	in	the	ground	covered	with	a	wooden	shack	.
And	it	's	that	basic	,	but	they	do	this	every	year	.
From	Siberia	to	the	Atacama	Desert	in	Chile	,	to	see	something	called	The	Very	Large	Telescope	.
The	Very	Large	Telescope	is	one	of	these	things	that	 astronomer 	 s 	 	do	--	they	name	their	 telescope 	 s 	 	rather	 un 	 imaginative 	 ly 	 	.
I	can	tell	you	for	a	fact	,	that	the	next	one	that	they	're	planning	is	called	The	 Extreme 	 ly 	 	Large	Telescope	.
And	you	would	n't	believe	it	,	but	the	one	after	that	is	going	to	be	called	The	 Overwhelm 	 ingly 	 	Large	Telescope	.
But	 none 	 theless 	 	,	it	's	an	 extraordinar 	 y 	 	piece	of	engineering	.
These	are	four	8.2	meter	 telescope 	 s 	 	.
And	these	 telescope 	 s 	 	,	among	other	things	,	they	're	being	used	to	study	how	the	expansion	of	the	universe	is	changing	with	time	.
And	the	more	you	understand	that	,	the	better	you	would	understand	what	this	dark	energy	that	the	universe	is	made	of	is	all	about	.
And	one	piece	of	engineering	that	I	want	to	leave	you	with	as	 regard 	 s 	 	this	telescope	is	the	mirror	.
Each	mirror	,	there	are	four	of	them	,	is	made	of	a	single	piece	of	glass	,	a	 mono 	 lithic 	 	piece	of	 high 	 - 	 tech 	 	ceramic	,	that	has	been	ground	down	and	polished	to	such	accuracy	that	the	only	way	to	understand	what	that	is	is	[	to	]	imagine	a	city	like	Paris	,	with	all	its	buildings	and	the	Eiffel	Tower	,	if	you	grind	down	Paris	to	that	kind	of	accuracy	,	you	would	be	left	with	 bump 	 s 	 	that	are	one	millimeter	high	.
And	that	's	the	kind	of	polishing	that	these	 mirror 	 s 	 	have	 endur 	 ed 	 	.
An	 extraordinar 	 y 	 	set	of	 telescope 	 s 	 	.
Here	's	another	view	of	the	same	.
The	reason	why	you	have	to	build	these	 telescope 	 s 	 	in	places	like	the	Atacama	Desert	is	because	of	the	high	altitude	desert	.
The	dry	air	is	 re 	 ally 	 	good	for	 telescope 	 s 	 	,	and	also	,	the	cloud	cover	is	below	the	summit	of	these	mountains	so	that	the	 telescope 	 s 	 	have	about	300	days	of	clear	 skie 	 s 	 	.
Finally	,	I	want	to	take	you	to	Antarctica	.
I	want	to	spend	most	of	my	time	on	this	part	of	the	world	.
This	is	cosmology	's	final	frontier	.
Some	of	the	most	amazing	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	some	of	the	most	extreme	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	are	being	done	in	Antarctica	.
I	was	there	to	view	something	called	a	 long 	 - 	 duration 	 	balloon	flight	,	which	 bas 	 ically 	 	takes	 telescope 	 s 	 	and	instruments	all	the	way	to	the	upper	atmosphere	,	the	upper	 strato 	 sphere 	 	,	40	km	up	.
And	that	's	where	they	do	their	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	and	then	the	balloon	,	the	payload	,	is	brought	down	.
So	this	is	us	landing	on	the	Ross	Ice	Shelf	in	Antarctica	.
That	's	an	American	 C 	 - 	 17 	 	cargo	plane	that	flew	us	from	New	Zealand	to	 McMur 	 do 	 	in	Antarctica	.
And	here	we	are	about	to	board	our	bus	.
And	I	do	n't	know	if	you	can	read	the	 letter 	 ing 	 	,	but	it	says	,	``	Ivan	the	 Terri 	 bus 	 	.	''
And	that	's	taking	us	to	 McMur 	 do 	 	.
And	this	is	the	scene	that	 greet 	 s 	 	you	in	 McMur 	 do 	 	.
And	you	 bare 	 ly 	 	might	be	able	to	make	out	this	hut	here	.
This	hut	was	built	by	Robert	Falcon	Scott	and	his	men	when	they	first	came	to	Antarctica	on	their	first	expedition	to	go	to	the	South	Pole	.
Because	it	's	so	cold	,	the	entire	 content 	 s 	 	of	that	hut	is	still	as	they	left	it	,	with	the	 re 	 mnants 	 	of	the	last	meal	they	cooked	still	there	.
It	's	an	 extraordinar 	 y 	 	place	.
This	is	 McMur 	 do 	 	itself	.	About	a	thousand	people	work	here	in	summer	,	and	about	200	in	winter	when	it	's	 complete 	 ly 	 	dark	for	six	months	.
I	was	here	to	see	the	launch	of	this	particular	type	of	instrument	.
This	is	a	cosmic	ray	experiment	that	has	been	launched	all	the	way	to	the	 upper 	 - 	 strato 	 sphere 	 	to	an	altitude	of	40	km	.
What	I	want	you	to	imagine	is	this	is	two	tons	in	weight	.
So	you	're	 us 	 ing 	 	a	balloon	to	carry	something	that	is	two	tons	all	the	way	to	an	altitude	of	40	km	.
And	the	 engineer 	 s 	 	,	the	 technician 	 s 	 	,	the	 physicist 	 s 	 	have	all	got	to	assemble	on	the	Ross	Ice	Shelf	,	because	Antarctica	--	I	wo	n't	go	into	the	reasons	why	--	but	it	's	one	of	the	most	favorable	places	for	 do 	 ing 	 	these	balloon	launches	,	except	for	the	weather	.
The	weather	,	as	you	can	imagine	,	this	is	summer	,	and	you	're	standing	on	200	ft	of	ice	.
And	there	's	a	volcano	behind	,	which	has	 glacier 	 s 	 	at	the	very	top	.
And	what	they	have	to	do	is	they	have	to	assemble	the	entire	balloon	--	the	fabric	,	parachute	and	everything	--	on	the	ice	and	then	fill	it	up	with	helium	.
And	that	process	takes	about	two	hours	.
And	the	weather	can	change	as	they	're	putting	together	this	whole	assembly	.
For	instance	,	here	they	are	laying	down	the	balloon	fabric	behind	,	which	is	 eventual 	 ly 	 	going	to	be	filled	up	with	helium	.
Those	two	trucks	you	see	at	the	very	end	carry	12	tanks	each	of	compressed	helium	.
Now	,	in	case	the	weather	changes	before	the	launch	,	they	have	to	actually	pack	everything	back	up	into	their	boxes	and	take	it	out	back	to	 McMur 	 do 	 	Station	.
And	this	particular	balloon	,	because	it	has	to	launch	two	tons	of	weight	,	is	an	 extreme 	 ly 	 	huge	balloon	.
The	fabric	alone	 weigh 	 s 	 	two	tons	.
In	order	to	minimize	the	weight	,	it	's	very	thin	,	it	's	as	thin	as	a	sandwich	wrapper	.
And	if	they	have	to	pack	it	back	,	they	have	to	put	it	into	boxes	and	stamp	on	it	so	that	it	fits	into	the	box	again	--	except	,	when	they	did	it	first	,	it	would	have	been	done	in	Texas	.
Here	,	they	ca	n't	do	it	with	the	kind	shoes	they	're	wearing	,	so	they	have	to	take	their	shoes	off	,	get	barefoot	into	the	boxes	,	in	this	cold	,	and	do	that	kind	of	work	.
That	's	the	kind	of	dedication	these	people	have	.
Here	's	the	balloon	being	filled	up	with	helium	,	and	you	can	see	it	's	a	 gorge 	 ous 	 	sight	.
Here	's	a	scene	that	shows	you	the	balloon	and	the	payload	 end 	 - 	 to 	 - 	 end 	 	.
So	the	balloon	is	being	filled	up	with	helium	on	the	 left 	 - 	 hand 	 	side	,	and	the	fabric	actually	runs	all	the	way	to	the	middle	where	there	's	a	piece	of	electronics	and	 explosive 	 s 	 	being	connected	to	a	parachute	,	and	then	the	parachute	is	then	connected	to	the	payload	.
And	remember	,	all	this	wiring	is	being	done	by	people	in	extreme	cold	,	in	 sub 	 - 	 zero 	 	 temperature 	 s 	 	.
They	're	wearing	about	15	kg	of	clothing	and	stuff	,	but	they	have	to	take	their	gloves	off	in	order	to	do	that	.
And	I	would	like	to	share	with	you	a	launch	.
Radio	:	Okay	,	release	the	balloon	,	release	the	balloon	,	release	the	balloon	.
Anil	 Anantha 	 swamy 	 	:	And	I	'll	finally	like	to	leave	you	with	two	images	.
This	is	an	observatory	in	the	 Himalaya 	 s 	 	,	in	Ladakh	in	India	.
And	the	thing	I	want	you	to	look	at	here	is	the	telescope	on	the	 right 	 - 	 hand 	 	side	.
And	on	the	far	left	there	is	a	400	 year 	 - 	 old 	 	Buddhist	monastery	.
This	is	a	 close 	 - 	 up 	 	of	the	Buddhist	monastery	.
And	I	was	struck	by	the	 juxta 	 position 	 	of	these	two	 e 	 normous 	 	disciplines	that	humanity	has	.
One	is	 explor 	 ing 	 	the	cosmos	on	the	outside	,	and	the	other	one	is	 explor 	 ing 	 	our	interior	being	.
And	both	require	silence	of	some	sort	.
And	what	struck	me	was	every	place	that	I	went	to	to	see	these	 telescope 	 s 	 	,	the	 astronomer 	 s 	 	and	 cosm 	 ologists 	 	are	in	search	of	a	certain	kind	of	silence	,	whether	it	's	silence	from	radio	pollution	or	light	pollution	or	whatever	.
And	it	was	very	obvious	that	,	if	we	destroy	these	silent	places	on	Earth	,	we	will	be	stuck	on	a	planet	without	the	ability	to	look	 outward 	 s 	 	,	because	we	will	not	be	able	to	understand	the	signals	that	come	from	outer	space	.
Thank	you	.

Paul	 Stam 	 ets 	 	on	6	ways	 mushroom 	 s 	 	can	save	the	world
I	love	a	challenge	,	and	saving	the	Earth	is	probably	a	good	one	.
We	all	know	the	Earth	is	in	trouble	.
We	have	now	entered	in	the	6X	,	the	sixth	major	extinction	on	this	planet	.
I	often	 wonder 	 ed 	 	,	if	there	was	a	United	Organization	of	 Organism 	 s 	 	--	otherwise	known	as	``	 Uh 	 - 	 Oh 	 	''	--	--	and	every	organism	had	a	right	to	vote	,	would	we	be	voted	on	the	planet	,	or	off	the	planet	?
I	think	that	vote	is	occurring	right	now	.
I	want	to	present	to	you	a	suite	of	six	 mycologic 	 al 	 	solutions	,	 us 	 ing 	 	fungi	,	and	these	solutions	are	based	on	mycelium	.
The	mycelium	 infus 	 es 	 	all	 landscape 	 s 	 	,	it	holds	soils	together	,	it	's	 extreme 	 ly 	 	 ten 	 acious 	 	.
This	holds	up	to	30,000	times	its	mass	.
They	're	the	grand	molecular	 disassemble 	 rs 	 	of	nature	--	the	soil	 magician 	 s 	 	.
They	generate	the	humus	soils	across	the	 land 	 masses 	 	of	Earth	.
We	have	now	discovered	that	there	is	a	 multi 	 - 	 directional 	 	transfer	of	 nutrient 	 s 	 	between	plants	,	mitigated	by	the	 mcy 	 elium 	 	--	so	the	mycelium	is	the	mother	that	is	giving	 nutrient 	 s 	 	from	alder	and	birch	trees	to	 hem 	 locks 	 	,	 cedar 	 s 	 	and	Douglas	firs	.
Dusty	and	I	,	we	like	to	say	,	on	Sunday	,	this	is	where	we	go	to	church	.
I	'm	in	love	with	the	 old 	 - 	 growth 	 	forest	,	and	I	'm	a	patriotic	American	because	we	have	those	.
Most	of	you	are	familiar	with	 Porto 	 bello 	 	 mushroom 	 s 	 	.
And	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	I	face	a	big	obstacle	.
When	I	mention	 mushroom 	 s 	 	to	 some 	 body 	 	,	they	 immediate 	 ly 	 	think	 Porto 	 bello 	 s 	 	or	magic	 mushroom 	 s 	 	,	their	eyes	glaze	over	,	and	they	think	I	'm	a	little	crazy	.
So	,	I	hope	to	pierce	that	prejudice	forever	with	this	group	.
We	call	it	 myco 	 phobia 	 	,	the	irrational	fear	of	the	unknown	,	when	it	comes	to	fungi	.
 Mushroom 	 s 	 	are	very	fast	in	their	growth	.
Day	21	,	day	23	,	day	25	.
 Mushroom 	 s 	 	produce	strong	 antibiotic 	 s 	 	.
In	fact	,	we	're	more	 close 	 ly 	 	related	to	fungi	than	we	are	to	any	other	kingdom	.
A	group	of	20	 eu 	 karyotic 	 	 micro 	 biologists 	 	published	a	paper	two	years	ago	 erect 	 ing 	 	 opistho 	 konta 	 	--	a	 super 	 - 	 kingdom 	 	that	 join 	 s 	 	 animal 	 ia 	 	and	fungi	together	.
We	share	in	common	the	same	pathogens	.
Fungi	do	n't	like	to	rot	from	bacteria	,	and	so	our	best	 antibiotic 	 s 	 	come	from	fungi	.
But	here	is	a	mushroom	that	's	past	its	prime	.
After	they	 spor 	 ulate 	 	,	they	do	rot	.
But	I	propose	to	you	that	the	sequence	of	 micro 	 bes 	 	that	occur	on	 rott 	 ing 	 	 mushroom 	 s 	 	are	essential	for	the	health	of	the	forest	.
They	give	rise	to	the	trees	,	they	create	the	debris	fields	that	feed	the	mycelium	.
And	so	we	see	a	mushroom	here	 spor 	 ulating 	 	.
And	the	spores	are	 germina 	 ting 	 	,	and	the	mycelium	forms	and	goes	underground	.
In	a	single	cubic	inch	of	soil	,	there	can	be	more	than	eight	miles	of	these	cells	.
My	foot	is	covering	approximately	300	miles	of	mycelium	.
This	is	 photo 	 micrograph 	 s 	 	from	Nick	Read	and	Patrick	Hickey	.
And	notice	that	as	the	mycelium	 grow 	 s 	 	,	it	 conquer 	 s 	 	territory	and	then	it	begins	the	net	.
I	've	been	a	scanning	electron	 microscop 	 ist 	 	for	many	years	,	I	have	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	electron	 micrograph 	 s 	 	,	and	when	I	'm	 star 	 ing 	 	at	the	mycelium	,	I	 realiz 	 e 	 	that	they	are	 micro 	 filtration 	 	membranes	.
We	 exhal 	 e 	 	carbon	dioxide	,	so	does	mycelium	.
It	 inha 	 les 	 	oxygen	,	just	like	we	do	.
But	these	are	 essential 	 ly 	 	 external 	 ized 	 	 stomach 	 s 	 	and	lungs	.
And	I	present	to	you	a	concept	that	these	are	extended	 neuro 	 logical 	 	membranes	.
And	in	these	cavities	,	these	 micro 	 - 	 cavities 	 	form	,	and	as	they	fuse	soils	,	they	absorb	water	.
These	are	little	wells	.
And	inside	these	wells	,	then	microbial	communities	begin	to	form	.
And	so	the	 spong 	 y 	 	soil	not	only	 resist 	 s 	 	erosion	,	but	sets	up	a	microbial	universe	that	gives	rise	to	a	 plural 	 ity 	 	of	other	organisms	.
I	first	proposed	,	in	the	early	1990s	,	that	mycelium	is	Earth	's	natural	Internet	.
When	you	look	at	the	mycelium	,	they	're	highly	branched	.
And	if	there	's	one	branch	that	is	broken	,	then	very	quickly	,	because	of	the	nodes	of	crossing	--	Internet	 engineer 	 s 	 	maybe	call	them	hot	points	--	there	are	alternative	 pathway 	 s 	 	for	 channel 	 ing 	 	 nutrient 	 s 	 	and	information	.
The	mycelium	is	sentient	.
It	knows	that	you	are	there	.
When	you	walk	across	 landscape 	 s 	 	,	it	 leap 	 s 	 	up	in	the	aftermath	of	your	 foot 	 steps 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	grab	debris	.
So	,	I	believe	the	invention	of	the	computer	Internet	is	an	 in 	 evitable 	 	consequence	of	a	 previousl 	 y 	 	proven	,	 biological 	 ly 	 	successful	model	.
The	Earth	 invent 	 ed 	 	the	computer	Internet	for	its	own	benefit	,	and	we	now	,	being	the	top	organism	on	this	planet	,	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	allocate	resources	in	order	to	protect	the	 bio 	 sphere 	 	.
Going	way	out	,	dark	matter	 conform 	 s 	 	to	the	same	 mycelia 	 l 	 	archetype	.
I	believe	matter	 beg 	 ets 	 	life	;	life	becomes	single	cells	;	single	cells	become	strings	;	strings	become	chains	;	chains	network	.
And	this	is	the	paradigm	that	we	see	throughout	the	universe	.
Most	of	you	may	not	know	that	fungi	were	the	first	organisms	to	come	to	land	.
They	came	to	land	1.3	billion	years	ago	,	and	plants	followed	several	hundred	million	years	later	.
How	is	that	possible	?
It	's	possible	because	the	mycelium	produces	oxalic	acids	,	and	many	other	acids	and	enzymes	,	 pock 	 marking 	 	rock	and	 grabb 	 ing 	 	calcium	and	other	minerals	and	forming	calcium	 oxalate 	 s 	 	.
Makes	the	rocks	crumble	,	and	the	first	step	in	the	generation	of	soil	.
 Oxal 	 ic 	 	acid	is	two	carbon	dioxide	molecules	joined	together	.
So	,	fungi	and	mycelium	sequester	carbon	dioxide	in	the	form	of	calcium	 oxalate 	 s 	 	.
And	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	other	 oxalate 	 s 	 	are	also	 sequester 	 ing 	 	carbon	dioxide	through	the	minerals	that	are	being	formed	and	taken	out	of	the	rock	matrix	.
This	was	first	discovered	in	1859	.
This	is	a	photograph	by	Franz	 Hueb 	 er 	 	.
This	photograph	's	taken	1950s	in	Saudi	Arabia	.
420	million	years	ago	,	this	organism	existed	.
It	was	called	 Proto 	 tax 	 ites 	 	.
 Proto 	 tax 	 ites 	 	,	laying	down	,	was	about	three	feet	tall	.
The	tallest	plants	on	Earth	at	that	time	were	less	than	two	feet	.
Dr.	Boyce	,	at	the	University	of	Chicago	,	published	an	article	in	the	Journal	of	Geology	this	past	year	 determin 	 ing 	 	that	 Proto 	 tax 	 ites 	 	was	a	giant	fungus	,	a	giant	mushroom	.
Across	the	 landscape 	 s 	 	of	Earth	were	dotted	these	giant	 mushroom 	 s 	 	.
All	across	most	land	masses	.
And	these	existed	for	tens	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	years	.
Now	,	we	've	had	several	extinction	events	,	and	as	we	march	forward	--	65	million	years	ago	--	most	of	you	know	about	it	--	we	had	an	asteroid	impact	.
The	Earth	was	struck	by	an	asteroid	,	a	huge	amount	of	debris	was	 jettison 	 ed 	 	into	the	atmosphere	.
Sunlight	was	cut	off	,	and	fungi	 inherit 	 ed 	 	the	Earth	.
Those	organisms	that	paired	with	fungi	were	rewarded	,	because	fungi	do	not	need	light	.
More	 recent 	 ly 	 	,	at	Einstein	University	,	they	just	determined	that	fungi	use	radiation	as	a	source	of	energy	,	much	like	plants	use	light	.
So	,	the	prospect	of	fungi	existing	on	other	 planet 	 s 	 	elsewhere	,	I	think	,	is	a	 for 	 gone 	 	conclusion	,	at	least	in	my	own	mind	.
The	largest	organism	in	the	world	is	in	Eastern	Oregon	.
I	could	n't	miss	it	.	It	was	2,200	acres	in	size	:	2,200	acres	in	size	,	2,000	years	old	.
The	largest	organism	on	the	planet	is	a	 mycelia 	 l 	 	mat	,	one	cell	wall	thick	.
How	is	it	that	this	organism	can	be	so	large	,	and	yet	be	one	cell	wall	thick	,	whereas	we	have	five	or	six	skin	layers	that	protect	us	?
The	mycelium	,	in	the	right	conditions	,	produces	a	mushroom	--	it	 burst 	 s 	 	through	with	such	 fero 	 city 	 	that	it	can	break	asphalt	.
We	were	involved	with	several	 experiment 	 s 	 	.
I	'm	going	to	show	you	six	,	if	I	can	,	solutions	for	 help 	 ing 	 	to	save	the	world	.
 Battell 	 e 	 	Laboratories	and	I	joined	up	in	 Bell 	 ingham 	 	,	Washington	.
There	were	four	piles	saturated	with	diesel	and	other	petroleum	waste	:	one	was	a	control	pile	;	one	pile	was	treated	with	enzymes	;	one	pile	was	treated	with	bacteria	;	and	our	pile	we	 inoculat 	 ed 	 	with	mushroom	mycelium	.
The	mycelium	 absorb 	 s 	 	the	oil	.
The	mycelium	is	producing	enzymes	--	 peroxidase 	 s 	 	--	that	break	 carbon 	 - 	 hydrogen 	 	bonds	.
These	are	the	same	bonds	that	hold	 hydrocarbon 	 s 	 	together	.
So	,	the	mycelium	becomes	saturated	with	the	oil	,	and	then	,	when	we	returned	six	weeks	later	,	all	the	 tarp 	 s 	 	were	removed	,	all	the	other	piles	were	dead	,	dark	and	 stink 	 y 	 	.
We	came	back	to	our	pile	,	it	was	covered	with	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	pounds	of	oyster	 mushroom 	 s 	 	,	and	the	color	changed	to	a	light	form	.
The	enzymes	 re 	 manufactured 	 	the	 hydrocarbon 	 s 	 	into	 carbo 	 hydrate 	 s 	 	--	fungal	sugars	.
Some	of	these	 mushroom 	 s 	 	are	very	happy	 mushroom 	 s 	 	.
They	're	very	large	.
They	're	showing	how	much	nutrition	that	they	could	've	obtained	.
But	something	else	happened	,	which	was	an	 epi 	 phany 	 	in	my	life	.
They	 spor 	 ulated 	 	,	the	spores	attract	 insect 	 s 	 	,	the	 insect 	 s 	 	laid	eggs	,	eggs	became	larvae	.
Birds	then	came	,	bringing	in	seeds	,	and	our	pile	became	an	oasis	of	life	.
Whereas	the	other	three	piles	were	dead	,	dark	and	 stink 	 y 	 	,	and	the	PAH	's	--	the	aromatic	 hydrocarbon 	 s 	 	--	went	from	10,000	parts	per	million	to	less	than	200	in	eight	weeks	.
The	last	image	we	do	n't	have	.
The	entire	pile	was	a	green	 ber 	 m 	 	of	life	.
These	are	gateway	species	,	vanguard	species	that	open	the	door	for	other	biological	communities	.
So	I	 invent 	 ed 	 	 bur 	 lap 	 	sacks	,	bunker	spawn	--	and	putting	the	mycelium	--	 us 	 ing 	 	storm	blown	debris	,	you	can	take	these	 bur 	 lap 	 	sacks	and	put	them	downstream	from	a	farm	that	's	producing	E.	coli	,	or	other	 waste 	 s 	 	,	or	a	factory	with	chemical	toxins	,	and	it	leads	to	habitat	restoration	.
So	,	we	set	up	a	site	in	Mason	County	,	Washington	,	and	we	've	seen	a	dramatic	decrease	in	the	amount	of	 col 	 iforms 	 	.
And	I	'll	show	you	a	graph	here	.
This	is	a	logarithmic	scale	,	10	to	the	eighth	power	.
There	's	more	than	a	100	million	colonies	per	gram	,	and	10	to	the	third	power	is	around	1,000	.
In	48	hours	to	72	hours	,	these	three	mushroom	species	reduced	the	amount	of	 co 	 liform 	 	bacteria	10,000	times	.
Think	of	the	 implication 	 s 	 	.
This	is	a	 space 	 - 	 conservative 	 	method	that	uses	storm	debris	--	and	we	can	guarantee	that	we	will	have	storms	every	year	.
So	,	this	one	mushroom	,	in	particular	,	has	drawn	our	interest	over	time	.
This	is	my	wife	Dusty	,	with	a	mushroom	called	 Fomit 	 opsis 	 	officinalis	--	 Agar 	 ikon 	 	.
It	's	a	mushroom	exclusive	to	the	 old 	 - 	 growth 	 	forest	that	 Dioscori 	 des 	 	first	described	in	65	A.D	.
as	a	treatment	against	consumption	.
This	mushroom	 grow 	 s 	 	in	Washington	State	,	Oregon	,	northern	California	,	British	Columbia	,	now	thought	to	be	extinct	in	Europe	.
May	not	seem	that	large	--	let	's	get	closer	.
This	is	 extreme 	 ly 	 	rare	fungus	.
Our	team	--	and	we	have	a	team	of	experts	that	go	out	--	we	went	out	20	times	in	the	 old 	 - 	 growth 	 	forest	last	year	.
We	found	one	sample	to	be	able	to	get	into	culture	.
 Preserv 	 ing 	 	the	genome	of	these	fungi	in	the	 old 	 - 	 growth 	 	forest	I	think	is	 absolute 	 ly 	 	critical	for	human	health	.
I	've	been	involved	with	the	U.S.	Defense	Department	 Bio 	 Shield 	 	program	.
We	submitted	over	300	samples	of	 mushroom 	 s 	 	that	were	boiled	in	hot	water	,	and	mycelium	harvesting	these	 extra 	 cellular 	 	 metabolite 	 s 	 	.
And	a	few	years	ago	,	we	received	these	results	.
We	have	three	different	 s 	 trains 	 	of	 Agar 	 ikon 	 	 mushroom 	 s 	 	that	were	highly	active	against	 poxvirus 	 es 	 	.
Dr.	Earl	Kern	,	who	's	a	 small 	 pox 	 	expert	of	the	U.S.	Defense	Department	,	states	that	any	compounds	that	have	a	selectivity	index	of	two	or	more	are	active	.
10	or	greater	are	considered	to	be	very	active	.
Our	mushroom	 s 	 trains 	 	were	in	the	highly	active	range	.
There	's	a	 vette 	 d 	 	press	release	that	you	can	read	--	it	's	 vette 	 d 	 	by	DOD	--	if	you	Google	``	 Stam 	 ets 	 	''	and	``	 small 	 pox 	 	.	''
Or	you	can	go	to	 NPR 	 .org 	 	and	listen	to	a	live	interview	.
So	,	encouraged	by	this	,	 natural 	 ly 	 	we	went	to	flu	viruses	.
And	so	,	for	the	first	time	,	I	am	showing	this	.
We	have	three	different	 s 	 trains 	 	of	 Agar 	 ikon 	 	 mushroom 	 s 	 	highly	active	against	flu	viruses	.
Here	's	the	selectivity	index	numbers	--	against	pox	,	you	saw	10s	and	20s	--	now	against	flu	viruses	,	compared	to	the	ribavirin	controls	,	we	have	an	 extraordinar 	 ily 	 	high	activity	.
And	we	're	 us 	 ing 	 	a	natural	extract	within	the	same	dosage	window	as	a	pure	pharmaceutical	.
We	tried	it	against	flu	A	viruses	--	H1N1	,	 H3N 	 2 	 	--	as	well	as	flu	B	viruses	.
So	then	we	tried	a	blend	,	and	in	a	blend	combination	we	tried	it	against	 H5N 	 1 	 	,	and	we	got	greater	than	1,000	selectivity	index	.
I	then	think	that	we	can	make	the	argument	that	we	should	save	the	 old 	 - 	 growth 	 	forest	as	a	matter	of	national	defense	.
I	became	interested	in	 entomo 	 pathogenic 	 	fungi	--	fungi	that	kill	 insect 	 s 	 	.
Our	house	was	being	destroyed	by	carpenter	ants	.
So	,	I	went	to	the	EPA	homepage	,	and	they	were	 recommend 	 ing 	 	studies	with	 meta 	 rhizi 	 um 	 	species	of	a	group	of	fungi	that	kill	carpenter	ants	,	as	well	as	 termite 	 s 	 	.
I	did	something	that	nobody	else	had	done	.
I	actually	chased	the	mycelium	,	when	it	stopped	producing	spores	.
These	are	spores	--	this	is	in	their	spores	.
I	was	able	to	morph	the	culture	into	a	 non 	 - 	 spor 	 ulating 	 	form	.
And	so	the	industry	has	spent	over	100	million	dollars	 s 	 pecifically 	 	on	bait	stations	to	prevent	 termite 	 s 	 	from	eating	your	house	.
But	the	 insect 	 s 	 	are	n't	stupid	,	and	they	would	avoid	the	spores	when	they	came	close	,	and	so	I	 morph 	 ed 	 	the	cultures	into	a	 non 	 - 	 spor 	 ulating 	 	form	.
And	I	got	my	daughter	's	Barbie	doll	dish	,	I	put	it	right	where	a	bunch	of	carpenter	ants	were	making	debris	fields	,	every	day	,	in	my	house	,	and	the	ants	were	 attract 	 ed 	 	to	the	mycelium	,	because	there	's	no	spores	.
They	gave	it	to	the	queen	.
One	week	later	,	I	had	no	 saw 	 dust 	 	piles	 what 	 soever 	 	.
And	then	--	a	 delicat 	 e 	 	dance	between	dinner	and	death	--	the	mycelium	is	consumed	by	the	ants	,	they	become	 mumm 	 ified 	 	,	and	,	 bo 	 ing 	 	,	a	mushroom	pops	out	of	their	head	.
Now	after	 spor 	 ulation 	 	,	the	spores	repel	.
So	,	the	house	is	no	 long 	 er 	 	suitable	for	invasion	.
So	,	you	have	a	 near 	 - 	 permanent 	 	solution	for	 re 	 invasion 	 	of	 termite 	 s 	 	.
And	so	my	house	came	down	,	I	received	my	first	patent	against	carpenter	ants	,	 termite 	 s 	 	and	fire	ants	.
Then	we	tried	 extract 	 s 	 	,	and	lo	and	behold	,	we	can	steer	 insect 	 s 	 	to	different	 direction 	 s 	 	.
This	has	huge	 implication 	 s 	 	.
I	then	received	my	second	patent	--	and	this	is	a	big	one	.
It	's	been	called	an	Alexander	Graham	Bell	patent	.
It	covers	over	200,000	species	.
This	is	the	most	disruptive	technology	--	I	've	been	told	by	 executive 	 s 	 	of	the	pesticide	industry	--	that	they	have	ever	 witness 	 ed 	 	.
This	could	totally	revamp	the	pesticide	industries	throughout	the	world	.
You	could	fly	100	 Ph 	 .D 	 . 	 	students	under	the	umbrella	of	this	concept	,	because	my	 supposit 	 ion 	 	is	that	 entomo 	 pathogenic 	 	fungi	,	prior	to	 spor 	 ulation 	 	,	attract	the	very	 insect 	 s 	 	that	are	otherwise	 repell 	 ed 	 	by	those	spores	.
And	so	I	came	up	with	a	Life	Box	,	because	I	needed	a	delivery	system	.
The	Life	Box	--	you	're	gon	na	be	getting	a	DVD	of	the	TED	conference	--	you	add	soil	,	you	add	water	,	you	have	 mycorrhiza 	 l 	 	and	 endo 	 phytic 	 	fungi	as	well	as	spores	,	like	of	the	 Agar 	 ikon 	 	mushroom	.
The	seeds	then	are	 mother 	 ed 	 	by	this	mycelium	.
And	then	you	put	tree	seeds	in	here	,	and	then	you	end	up	growing	--	 potential 	 ly 	 	--	an	 old 	 - 	 growth 	 	forest	from	a	 card 	 board 	 	box	.
I	want	to	 re 	 invent 	 	the	delivery	system	,	and	the	use	of	 card 	 board 	 	around	the	world	,	so	they	become	 ec 	 ological 	 	 footprint 	 s 	 	.
If	there	's	a	 YouTube 	 - 	 like 	 	site	that	you	could	put	up	,	you	could	make	it	 i 	 nteractive 	 	,	zip	code	specific	--	where	people	could	join	together	,	and	through	satellite	imaging	systems	,	through	Virtual	Earth	or	Google	Earth	,	you	could	confirm	carbon	credits	are	being	 sequester 	 ed 	 	by	the	trees	that	are	coming	through	Life	Boxes	.
You	could	take	a	 card 	 board 	 	box	 deliver 	 ing 	 	shoes	,	you	could	add	water	--	I	developed	this	for	the	refugee	community	--	 corn 	 s 	 	,	beans	and	squash	and	 onion 	 s 	 	.
I	took	several	 container 	 s 	 	--	my	wife	said	,	if	I	could	do	this	,	 any 	 body 	 	could	--	and	I	ended	up	growing	a	seed	garden	.
Then	you	harvest	the	seeds	--	and	thank	you	,	Eric	Rasmussen	,	for	your	help	on	this	--	and	then	you	're	harvesting	the	seed	garden	.
Then	you	can	harvest	the	 kernel 	 s 	 	,	and	then	you	just	need	a	few	 kernel 	 s 	 	.
I	add	mycelium	to	it	,	and	then	I	 inoculat 	 e 	 	the	 corn 	 cob 	 s 	 	.
Now	,	three	 corn 	 cob 	 s 	 	,	no	other	grain	--	lots	of	 mushroom 	 s 	 	begin	to	form	.
Too	many	 withdrawal 	 s 	 	from	the	carbon	bank	,	and	so	this	population	will	be	shut	down	.
But	watch	what	 happen 	 s 	 	here	.
The	 mushroom 	 s 	 	then	are	 harvest 	 ed 	 	,	but	very	 important 	 ly 	 	,	the	mycelium	has	converted	the	cellulose	into	fungal	sugars	.
And	so	I	thought	,	how	could	we	address	the	energy	crisis	in	this	country	?
And	we	came	up	with	 Econo 	 l 	 	.
Generating	ethanol	from	cellulose	 us 	 ing 	 	mycelium	as	an	 intermedi 	 ary 	 	--	and	you	gain	all	the	benefits	that	I	've	described	to	you	already	.
But	to	go	from	cellulose	to	ethanol	is	 eco 	 logically 	 	 un 	 intelligent 	 	,	and	I	think	that	we	need	to	be	 econo 	 logically 	 	intelligent	about	the	generation	of	fuels	.
So	,	we	build	the	carbon	banks	on	the	planet	,	renew	the	soils	.
These	are	a	species	that	we	need	to	join	with	.
I	think	engaging	mycelium	can	help	save	the	world	.
Thank	you	very	much	.

Stacey	Kramer	:	The	best	gift	I	ever	 surviv 	 ed 	 
Imagine	,	if	you	will	--	a	gift	.
I	'd	like	for	you	to	picture	it	in	your	mind	.
It	's	not	too	big	--	about	the	size	of	a	golf	ball	.
So	 en 	 vision 	 	what	it	looks	like	all	wrapped	up	.
But	before	I	show	you	what	's	inside	,	I	will	tell	you	,	it	's	going	to	do	 incredibl 	 e 	 	things	for	you	.
It	will	bring	all	of	your	family	together	.
You	will	feel	loved	and	appreciated	like	never	before	and	 re 	 connect 	 	with	friends	and	 acquaintance 	 s 	 	you	have	n't	heard	from	in	years	.
Adoration	and	admiration	will	overwhelm	you	.
It	will	 reca 	 librate 	 	what	's	most	important	in	your	life	.
It	will	 re 	 define 	 	your	sense	of	 s 	 pirituality 	 	and	faith	.
You	'll	have	a	new	understanding	and	trust	in	your	body	.
You	'll	have	 un 	 surpassed 	 	 vital 	 ity 	 	and	energy	.
You	'll	expand	your	vocabulary	,	meet	new	people	,	and	you	'll	have	a	 health 	 ier 	 	lifestyle	.
And	get	this	--	you	'll	have	an	 eight 	 - 	 week 	 	vacation	of	 do 	 ing 	 	 absolute 	 ly 	 	nothing	.
You	'll	eat	 count 	 less 	 	gourmet	meals	.
Flowers	will	arrive	by	the	 truck 	 load 	 	.
People	will	say	to	you	,	``	You	look	great	.	Have	you	had	any	work	done	?	''
And	you	'll	have	a	lifetime	supply	of	good	drugs	.
You	'll	be	 challenge 	 d 	 	,	inspired	,	motivated	and	 humble 	 d 	 	.
Your	life	will	have	new	meaning	.
Peace	,	health	,	 seren 	 ity 	 	,	happiness	,	nirvana	.
The	price	?
$	55,000	,	and	that	's	an	 incredibl 	 e 	 	deal	.
By	now	I	know	you	're	dying	to	know	what	it	is	and	where	you	can	get	one	.
Does	Amazon	carry	it	?
Does	it	have	the	Apple	logo	on	it	?
Is	there	a	waiting	list	?
Not	 like 	 ly 	 	.
This	gift	came	to	me	about	five	months	ago	.
It	looked	more	like	this	when	it	was	all	wrapped	up	--	not	quite	so	pretty	.
And	this	,	and	then	this	.
It	was	a	rare	gem	--	a	brain	tumor	,	 hemangioblast 	 oma 	 	--	the	gift	that	keeps	on	giving	.
And	while	I	'm	okay	now	,	I	would	n't	wish	this	gift	for	you	.
I	'm	not	sure	you	'd	want	it	.
But	I	would	n't	change	my	experience	.
It	 profound 	 ly 	 	altered	my	life	in	ways	I	did	n't	expect	in	all	the	ways	I	just	shared	with	you	.
So	the	next	time	you	're	faced	with	something	that	's	unexpected	,	unwanted	and	uncertain	,	consider	that	it	just	may	be	a	gift	.
http	:	//www.ted.com/talks/helen_fisher_studies_the_brain_in_love.html
Why	do	we	crave	love	so	much	,	even	to	the	point	that	we	would	die	for	it	?	To	learn	more	about	our	very	real	,	very	physical	need	for	romantic	love	,	Helen	Fisher	and	her	research	team	took	 MRI 	 s 	 	of	people	in	love	--	and	people	who	had	just	been	 dump 	 ed 	 	.

Helen	Fisher	studies	the	brain	in	love
I	and	my	 colleague 	 s 	 	Art	Aron	and	Lucy	Brown	and	others	,	have	put	37	people	who	are	 mad 	 ly 	 	in	love	into	a	functional	MRI	brain	scanner	.
17	who	were	 happi 	 ly 	 	in	love	,	15	who	had	just	been	 dump 	 ed 	 	,	and	we	're	just	starting	our	third	experiment	:	 study 	 ing 	 	people	who	report	that	they	're	still	in	love	after	10	to	25	years	of	marriage	.
So	,	this	is	the	short	story	of	that	research	.
In	the	 jungle 	 s 	 	of	Guatemala	,	in	Tikal	,	stands	a	temple	.
It	was	built	by	the	 grand 	 est 	 	Sun	King	,	of	the	 grand 	 est 	 	 city 	 - 	 state 	 	,	of	the	 grand 	 est 	 	civilization	of	the	Americas	,	the	 Maya 	 s 	 	.
His	name	was	 Jasa 	 w 	 	Chan	 K' 	 awiil 	 	.
He	stood	over	six	feet	tall	.
He	lived	into	his	80s	,	and	he	was	buried	beneath	this	monument	in	720	AD	.
And	Mayan	 inscription 	 s 	 	proclaim	that	he	was	 deep 	 ly 	 	in	love	with	his	wife	.
So	,	he	built	a	temple	in	her	honor	,	facing	his	.
And	every	spring	and	autumn	,	 exact 	 ly 	 	at	the	equinox	,	the	sun	rises	behind	his	temple	,	and	 perfect 	 ly 	 	 bath 	 es 	 	her	temple	with	his	shadow	.
And	as	the	sun	sets	behind	her	temple	in	the	afternoon	,	it	 perfect 	 ly 	 	 bath 	 es 	 	his	temple	with	her	shadow	.
After	1,300	years	,	these	two	lovers	still	touch	and	kiss	from	their	tomb	.
Around	the	world	,	people	love	.
They	 s 	 ing 	 	for	love	,	they	dance	for	love	,	they	compose	poems	and	stories	about	love	.
They	tell	myths	and	legends	about	love	.
They	pine	for	love	,	they	live	for	love	,	they	kill	for	love	,	and	they	die	for	love	.
As	Walt	Whitman	once	said	,	he	said	,	``	Oh	,	I	would	stake	all	for	you	.	''
 Anthropologist 	 s 	 	have	found	evidence	of	romantic	love	in	170	societies	.
They	've	never	found	a	society	that	did	not	have	it	.
But	love	is	n't	always	a	happy	experience	.
In	one	study	of	college	students	,	they	asked	a	lot	of	questions	about	love	,	but	the	two	that	stood	out	to	me	the	most	were	,	``	Have	you	ever	been	 reject 	 ed 	 	by	 some 	 body 	 	who	you	 re 	 ally 	 	loved	?	''
And	the	second	question	was	,	``	Have	you	ever	 dump 	 ed 	 	 some 	 body 	 	who	 re 	 ally 	 	loved	you	?	''
And	almost	95	percent	of	both	men	and	women	said	yes	to	both	.
Almost	nobody	 get 	 s 	 	out	of	love	alive	.
So	,	before	I	start	telling	you	about	the	brain	,	I	want	to	read	for	you	what	I	think	is	the	most	powerful	love	poem	on	Earth	.
There	's	other	love	poems	that	are	,	of	course	,	just	as	good	,	but	I	do	n't	think	this	one	can	be	surpassed	.
It	was	told	by	an	anonymous	Kwakiutl	Indian	of	southern	Alaska	to	a	 mission 	 ary 	 	in	1896	,	and	here	it	is	.
I	've	never	had	the	opportunity	to	say	it	before	.
``	Fire	runs	through	my	body	with	the	pain	of	loving	you	.
Pain	runs	through	my	body	with	the	fires	of	my	love	for	you	.
Pain	like	a	boil	about	to	burst	with	my	love	for	you	,	consumed	by	fire	with	my	love	for	you	.
I	remember	what	you	said	to	me	.
I	am	thinking	of	your	love	for	me	.
I	am	torn	by	your	love	for	me	.
Pain	and	more	pain	--	where	are	you	going	with	my	love	?
I	am	told	you	will	go	from	here	.
I	am	told	you	will	leave	me	here	.
My	body	is	numb	with	grief	.
Remember	what	I	said	,	my	love	.
Goodbye	,	my	love	,	goodbye	.	''
Emily	Dickinson	once	wrote	,	``	 Part 	 ing 	 	is	all	we	need	to	know	of	hell	.	''
How	many	people	have	 suffer 	 ed 	 	in	all	the	 million 	 s 	 	of	years	of	human	evolution	?
How	many	people	around	the	world	are	dancing	with	 el 	 ation 	 	at	this	very	minute	?
Romantic	love	is	one	of	the	most	powerful	 sensation 	 s 	 	on	Earth	.
So	,	several	years	ago	,	I	decided	to	look	into	the	brain	and	study	this	madness	.
Our	first	study	of	people	who	were	 happi 	 ly 	 	in	love	has	been	 wide 	 ly 	 	 public 	 ized 	 	,	so	I	'm	only	going	to	say	a	very	little	about	it	.
We	found	activity	in	a	tiny	,	little	factory	near	the	base	of	the	brain	called	the	ventral	tegmental	area	.
We	found	activity	in	some	cells	called	the	 A 	 10 	 	cells	,	cells	that	actually	make	dopamine	,	a	natural	stimulant	,	and	spray	it	to	many	brain	regions	.
Indeed	,	this	part	,	the	VTA	,	is	part	of	the	brain	's	reward	system	.
It	's	way	below	your	cognitive	thinking	process	.
It	's	below	your	emotions	.
It	's	part	of	what	we	call	the	reptilian	core	of	the	brain	,	associated	with	 wan 	 ting 	 	,	with	motivation	,	with	focus	and	with	 crav 	 ing 	 	.
In	fact	,	the	same	brain	region	where	we	found	activity	becomes	active	also	when	you	feel	the	rush	of	cocaine	.
But	romantic	love	is	much	more	than	a	cocaine	high	--	at	least	you	come	down	from	cocaine	.
Romantic	love	is	an	obsession	.	It	 possesse 	 s 	 	you	.
You	lose	your	sense	of	self	.
You	ca	n't	stop	thinking	about	another	human	being	.
 Some 	 body 	 	is	camping	in	your	head	.
As	an	 eighth 	 - 	 century 	 	Japanese	poet	said	,	``	My	 long 	 ing 	 	had	no	time	when	it	 cease 	 s 	 	.	''
Wild	is	love	.
And	the	obsession	can	get	worse	when	you	've	been	 reject 	 ed 	 	.
So	,	right	now	,	Lucy	Brown	and	I	,	the	 neuro 	 scientist 	 	on	our	project	,	are	looking	at	the	data	of	the	people	who	were	put	into	the	machine	after	they	had	just	been	 dump 	 ed 	 	.
It	was	very	difficult	actually	,	putting	these	people	in	the	machine	,	because	they	were	in	such	bad	shape	.
So	 any 	 way 	 	,	we	found	activity	in	three	brain	regions	.
We	found	activity	in	the	brain	region	,	in	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	brain	region	associated	with	intense	romantic	love	.
What	a	bad	deal	.
You	know	,	when	you	've	been	 dump 	 ed 	 	,	the	one	thing	you	love	to	do	is	just	forget	about	this	human	being	,	and	then	go	on	with	your	life	--	but	no	,	you	just	love	them	 hard 	 er 	 	.
As	the	poet	Terence	,	the	Roman	poet	once	said	,	he	said	,	``	The	less	my	hope	,	the	 hot 	 ter 	 	my	love	.	''
And	 inde 	 ed 	 	,	we	now	know	why	.
Two	thousand	years	later	,	we	can	explain	this	in	the	brain	.
That	brain	system	--	the	reward	system	for	 wan 	 ting 	 	,	for	motivation	,	for	 crav 	 ing 	 	,	for	focus	--	becomes	more	active	when	you	ca	n't	get	what	you	want	.
In	this	case	,	life	's	greatest	prize	:	an	appropriate	mating	partner	.
We	found	activity	in	other	brain	regions	also	--	in	a	brain	region	associated	with	calculating	 gain 	 s 	 	and	losses	.
You	know	,	you	're	 ly 	 ing 	 	there	,	you	're	looking	at	the	picture	,	and	you	're	in	this	machine	,	and	you	're	calculating	,	you	know	,	what	went	wrong	.
How	,	you	know	,	what	have	I	lost	?
As	a	matter	of	fact	,	Lucy	and	I	have	a	little	joke	about	this	.
It	comes	from	a	David	Mamet	play	,	and	there	's	two	con	artists	in	the	play	,	and	the	woman	is	 con 	 ning 	 	the	man	,	and	the	man	looks	at	the	woman	and	says	,	``	Oh	,	you	're	a	bad	pony	,	I	'm	not	going	to	bet	on	you	.	''
And	 inde 	 ed 	 	,	it	's	this	part	of	the	brain	,	the	core	of	the	nucleus	 accum 	 bens 	 	,	actually	,	that	is	becoming	active	as	you	're	measuring	your	 gain 	 s 	 	and	losses	.
It	's	also	the	brain	region	that	becomes	active	when	you	're	willing	to	take	 e 	 normous 	 	risks	for	huge	 gain 	 s 	 	and	huge	losses	.
Last	but	not	least	,	we	found	activity	in	a	brain	region	associated	with	deep	attachment	to	another	individual	.
No	wonder	people	suffer	around	the	world	,	and	we	have	so	many	crimes	of	passion	.
When	you	've	been	 reject 	 ed 	 	in	love	,	not	only	are	you	 engulf 	 ed 	 	with	 feeling 	 s 	 	of	romantic	love	,	but	you	're	feeling	deep	attachment	to	this	individual	.
Moreover	,	this	brain	circuit	for	reward	is	working	,	and	you	're	feeling	intense	energy	,	intense	focus	,	intense	motivation	and	the	 willing 	 ness 	 	to	risk	it	all	to	win	life	's	greatest	prize	.
So	,	what	have	I	learned	from	this	experiment	that	I	would	like	to	tell	the	world	?
Foremost	,	I	have	come	to	think	that	romantic	love	is	a	drive	,	a	basic	mating	drive	.
Not	the	sex	drive	--	the	sex	drive	 get 	 s 	 	you	out	there	,	looking	for	a	whole	range	of	partners	.
Romantic	love	 en 	 ables 	 	you	to	focus	your	mating	energy	on	just	one	at	a	time	,	 conserv 	 e 	 	your	mating	energy	,	and	start	the	mating	process	with	this	single	individual	.
I	think	of	all	the	poetry	that	I	've	read	about	romantic	love	,	what	 sum 	 s 	 	it	up	best	is	something	that	is	said	by	Plato	,	over	2,000	years	ago	.
He	said	,	``	The	god	of	love	lives	in	a	state	of	need	.
It	is	a	need	.	It	is	an	urge	.
It	is	a	 homeostat 	 ic 	 	 im 	 balance 	 	.
Like	hunger	and	thirst	,	it	's	almost	impossible	to	stamp	out	.	''
I	've	also	come	to	believe	that	romantic	love	is	an	addiction	:	a	 perfect 	 ly 	 	wonderful	addiction	when	it	's	going	well	,	and	a	 perfect 	 ly 	 	 h 	 orrible 	 	addiction	when	it	's	going	 poor 	 ly 	 	.
And	 inde 	 ed 	 	,	it	has	all	of	the	characteristics	of	addiction	.
You	focus	on	the	person	,	you	 obsessive 	 ly 	 	think	about	them	,	you	crave	them	,	you	distort	reality	,	your	 willing 	 ness 	 	to	take	 e 	 normous 	 	risks	to	win	this	person	.
And	it	's	got	the	three	main	characteristics	of	addiction	:	tolerance	,	you	need	to	see	them	more	,	and	more	,	and	more	;	 withdrawal 	 s 	 	;	and	last	,	 re 	 lapse 	 	.
I	've	got	a	girlfriend	who	's	just	getting	over	a	terrible	love	affair	.
It	's	been	about	eight	months	,	she	's	beginning	to	feel	better	.
And	she	was	driving	along	in	her	car	the	other	day	,	and	 sudden 	 ly 	 	she	heard	a	song	on	the	car	radio	that	 re 	 minded 	 	her	of	this	man	.
And	she	--	not	only	did	the	instant	 crav 	 ing 	 	come	back	,	but	she	had	to	pull	over	from	the	side	of	the	road	and	cry	.
So	,	one	thing	I	would	like	the	medical	community	,	and	the	legal	community	,	and	even	the	college	community	,	to	see	if	they	can	understand	,	that	 inde 	 ed 	 	,	romantic	love	is	one	of	the	most	addictive	 substance 	 s 	 	on	Earth	.
I	would	also	like	to	tell	the	world	that	animals	love	.
There	's	not	an	animal	on	this	planet	that	will	 copula 	 te 	 	with	anything	that	comes	along	.
Too	old	,	too	young	,	too	 scruff 	 y 	 	,	too	stupid	,	and	they	wo	n't	do	it	.
Unless	you	're	stuck	in	a	laboratory	cage	--	and	you	know	,	if	you	spend	your	entire	life	in	a	little	box	,	you	're	not	going	to	be	as	 pick 	 y 	 	about	who	you	have	sex	with	--	but	I	've	looked	in	a	hundred	species	,	and	everywhere	in	the	wild	,	animals	have	 favorit 	 es 	 	.
As	a	matter	of	fact	 eth 	 ologists 	 	know	this	.
There	are	over	eight	words	for	what	they	call	``	animal	 favorit 	 ism 	 	:	''	selective	 pro 	 cept 	 ivity 	 	,	mate	choice	,	female	choice	,	sexual	choice	.
And	 inde 	 ed 	 	,	there	are	now	three	academic	articles	in	which	they	've	looked	at	this	attraction	,	which	may	only	last	for	a	second	,	but	it	's	a	definite	attraction	,	and	either	this	same	brain	region	,	this	reward	system	,	or	the	chemicals	of	that	reward	system	are	involved	.
In	fact	,	I	think	animal	attraction	can	be	instant	--	you	can	see	an	elephant	 instant 	 ly 	 	go	for	another	elephant	.
And	I	think	that	this	is	 re 	 ally 	 	the	origin	of	what	you	and	I	call	``	love	at	first	sight	.	''
People	have	often	asked	me	whether	what	I	know	about	love	has	spoiled	it	for	me	.
And	I	just	simply	say	,	``	 Hard 	 ly 	 	.	''
You	can	know	every	single	ingredient	in	a	piece	of	chocolate	cake	,	and	then	when	you	sit	down	and	eat	that	cake	,	you	can	still	feel	that	joy	.
And	 certain 	 ly 	 	,	I	make	all	the	same	 mistake 	 s 	 	that	everybody	else	does	too	,	but	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	deepened	my	understanding	and	compassion	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	for	all	human	life	.
As	a	matter	of	fact	,	in	New	York	,	I	often	catch	myself	looking	in	baby	 carriage 	 s 	 	and	feeling	a	little	sorry	for	the	tot	.
And	in	fact	,	sometimes	I	feel	a	little	sorry	for	the	chicken	on	my	dinner	plate	,	when	I	think	of	how	intense	this	brain	system	is	.
Our	 ne 	 west 	 	experiment	has	been	hatched	by	my	colleague	,	Art	Aron	--	putting	people	who	are	reporting	that	they	are	still	in	love	,	in	a	 long 	 - 	 term 	 	relationship	,	into	the	functional	MRI	.
We	've	put	five	people	in	so	far	,	and	 inde 	 ed 	 	,	we	found	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	thing	.	They	're	not	 ly 	 ing 	 	.
The	brain	areas	associated	with	intense	romantic	love	still	become	active	,	25	years	later	.
There	are	still	many	questions	to	be	answered	and	asked	about	romantic	love	.
The	question	that	I	'm	working	on	right	this	minute	--	and	I	'm	only	going	to	say	it	for	a	second	,	and	then	end	--	is	,	why	do	you	fall	in	love	with	one	person	,	rather	than	another	?
I	never	would	have	even	thought	to	think	of	this	,	but	 Match 	 .com 	 	,	the	 Internet 	 - 	 dating 	 	site	,	came	to	me	three	years	ago	and	asked	me	that	question	.
And	I	said	,	I	do	n't	know	.
I	know	what	 happen 	 s 	 	in	the	brain	,	when	you	do	become	in	love	,	but	I	do	n't	know	why	you	fall	in	love	with	one	person	rather	than	another	.
And	so	,	I	've	spent	the	last	three	years	on	this	.
And	there	are	many	reasons	that	you	fall	in	love	with	one	person	rather	than	another	,	that	 psychologist 	 s 	 	can	tell	you	.
And	we	tend	to	fall	in	love	with	 some 	 body 	 	from	the	same	 socio 	 economic 	 	background	,	the	same	general	level	of	intelligence	,	the	same	general	level	of	good	looks	,	the	same	religious	values	.
Your	childhood	 certain 	 ly 	 	plays	a	role	,	but	nobody	knows	how	.
And	that	's	about	it	,	that	's	all	they	know	.
No	,	they	've	never	found	the	way	two	personalities	fit	together	to	make	a	good	relationship	.
So	,	it	began	to	occur	to	me	that	maybe	your	biology	 pull 	 s 	 	you	towards	some	people	rather	than	another	.
And	I	have	 concoct 	 ed 	 	a	 question 	 naire 	 	to	see	to	what	degree	you	express	dopamine	,	serotonin	,	estrogen	and	testosterone	.
I	think	we	've	evolved	four	very	broad	personality	types	associated	with	the	 ratio 	 s 	 	of	these	four	chemicals	in	the	brain	.
And	on	this	dating	site	that	I	have	created	,	called	 Chemistry 	 .com 	 	,	I	ask	you	first	a	series	of	questions	to	see	to	what	degree	you	express	these	chemicals	,	and	I	'm	watching	who	 choose 	 s 	 	who	to	love	.
And	3.7	million	people	have	taken	the	 question 	 naire 	 	in	America	.
About	600,000	people	have	taken	it	in	33	other	countries	.
I	'm	putting	the	data	together	now	,	and	at	some	point	--	there	will	always	be	magic	to	love	,	but	I	think	I	will	come	closer	to	understanding	why	it	is	you	can	walk	into	a	room	and	everybody	is	from	your	background	,	your	same	general	level	of	intelligence	,	your	same	general	level	of	good	looks	,	and	you	do	n't	feel	 pull 	 ed 	 	towards	all	of	them	.
I	think	there	's	biology	to	that	.
I	think	we	're	going	to	end	up	,	in	the	next	few	years	,	to	understand	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	brain	mechanisms	that	pull	us	to	one	person	rather	than	another	.
So	,	I	will	close	with	this	.	These	are	my	older	people	.
Faulkner	once	said	,	``	The	past	is	not	dead	,	it	's	not	even	the	past	.	''
Indeed	,	we	carry	a	lot	of	luggage	from	our	 yester 	 year 	 	in	the	human	brain	.
And	so	,	there	's	one	thing	that	makes	me	pursue	my	understanding	of	human	nature	,	and	this	 re 	 minds 	 	me	of	it	.
These	are	two	women	.
Women	tend	to	get	intimacy	 different 	 ly 	 	than	men	do	.
Women	get	intimacy	from	 face 	 - 	 to 	 - 	 face 	 	talking	.
We	swivel	towards	each	other	,	we	do	what	we	call	the	``	 anchor 	 ing 	 	gaze	''	and	we	talk	.
This	is	intimacy	to	women	.
I	think	it	comes	from	 million 	 s 	 	of	years	of	holding	that	baby	in	front	of	your	face	,	 cajol 	 ing 	 	it	,	 reprimand 	 ing 	 	it	,	 educat 	 ing 	 	it	with	words	.
Men	tend	to	get	intimacy	from	 side 	 - 	 by 	 - 	 side 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	.
As	soon	as	one	guy	looks	up	,	the	other	guy	will	look	away	.
I	think	it	comes	from	 million 	 s 	 	of	years	of	standing	behind	that	--	sitting	behind	the	bush	,	looking	straight	 a 	 head 	 	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	hit	that	buffalo	on	the	head	with	a	rock	.
I	think	,	for	 million 	 s 	 	of	years	,	men	faced	their	enemies	,	they	sat	side	by	side	with	friends	.
So	my	final	statement	is	:	love	is	in	us	.
It	's	 deep 	 ly 	 	embedded	in	the	brain	.
Our	challenge	is	to	understand	each	other	.	Thank	you	.

It	's	 re 	 ally 	 	quite	an	honor	to	be	here	tonight	,	and	I	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	glad	that	I	stayed	here	and	 listen 	 ed 	 	because	I	've	 re 	 ally 	 	been	inspired	.
And	I	'm	going	to	play	some	songs	for	you	tonight	that	are	,	literally	,	world	 premiere 	 s 	 	.
I	've	been	working	on	my	new	record	and	I	've	never	played	these	songs	for	 any 	 body 	 	except	the	 micro 	 phone 	 	.
This	is	a	song	that	I	wrote	about	the	meaning	of	technology	,	which	goes	 perfect 	 ly 	 	with	this	gathering	.
I	started	thinking	about	--	when	I	was	in	college	,	especially	as	a	blind	person	,	 do 	 ing 	 	a	research	paper	was	a	major	 undertak 	 ing 	 	.
You	had	to	go	to	the	library	,	see	if	you	could	get	them	to	find	the	books	for	you	,	you	know	,	footnotes	and	all	that	.
Now	you	can	just	go	on	Google	.	Just	look	it	up	.
I	wish	I	had	that	when	I	was	in	college	.
Anyway	,	this	is	a	song	about	:	we	have	all	this	,	but	what	are	we	going	to	do	with	it	?
It	's	called	``	All	the	Answers	.	''
 W 	 hew 	 	!	It	's	a	miracle	I	did	n't	make	any	 mistake 	 s 	 	on	that	song	.
That	's	the	first	time	I	've	ever	played	it	.
It	's	a	``	feel	the	fear	and	do	it	 any 	 way 	 	''	kind	of	thing	.
This	next	song	is	a	song	that	started	out	as	a	dream	--	a	childhood	dream	.
It	was	one	of	the	titles	that	I	was	sort	of	thinking	about	calling	my	record	,	except	there	's	a	couple	of	problems	.
One	thing	is	,	it	's	 un 	 pronounce 	 able 	 	.
And	it	's	a	 made 	 - 	 up 	 	word	.
It	's	called	``	 Tembe 	 re 	 rana 	 	.	''
And	the	song	is	based	on	what	I	think	was	my	first	childhood	attempts	to	think	about	invisible	forces	.
So	``	 tember 	 er 	 ana 	 	''	was	these	dreams	,	in	which	I	would	be	running	away	from	bad	 feeling 	 s 	 	--	is	the	only	way	I	can	put	it	.
So	this	is	called	``	 Tembe 	 re 	 rana 	 	.	''
It	's	based	on	an	 Argentini 	 an 	 	rhythm	called	``	 carnival 	 ito 	 	.	''

Jane	 Poynt 	 er 	 	:	Life	in	 Bio 	 sphere 	 	2
I	have	had	the	distinct	pleasure	of	living	inside	two	 bio 	 spheres 	 	.
Of	course	we	all	here	in	this	room	live	in	 Bio 	 sphere 	 	1	.
I	've	also	lived	in	 Bio 	 sphere 	 	2	.
And	the	wonderful	thing	about	that	is	that	I	get	to	compare	 bio 	 spheres 	 	.
And	 hopeful 	 ly 	 	from	that	I	get	to	learn	something	.
So	what	did	I	learn	?	Well	,	here	I	am	inside	 Bio 	 sphere 	 	2	,	making	a	pizza	.
So	I	am	harvesting	the	wheat	,	in	order	to	make	the	dough	.
And	then	of	course	I	have	to	milk	the	goats	and	feed	the	goats	in	order	to	make	the	cheese	.
It	took	me	four	months	in	 Bio 	 sphere 	 	2	to	make	a	pizza	.
Here	in	 Bio 	 sphere 	 	1	,	well	it	takes	me	about	two	minutes	,	because	I	pick	up	the	phone	and	I	call	and	say	,	``	Hey	,	can	you	deliver	the	pizza	?	''
So	 Bio 	 sphere 	 	2	was	 essential 	 ly 	 	a	 three 	 - 	 acre 	 	,	 entire 	 ly 	 	sealed	,	miniature	world	that	I	lived	in	for	two	years	and	20	minutes	.
Over	the	top	it	was	sealed	with	steel	and	glass	,	 u 	 nderneath 	 	it	was	sealed	with	a	pan	of	steel	--	 essential 	 ly 	 	 entire 	 ly 	 	sealed	.
So	we	had	our	own	miniature	rainforest	,	a	private	beach	with	a	coral	reef	.
We	had	a	savanna	,	a	marsh	,	a	desert	.
We	had	our	own	 half 	 - 	 acre 	 	farm	that	we	had	to	grow	everything	.
And	of	course	we	had	our	human	habitat	,	where	we	lived	.
Back	in	the	 mid 	 - 	 ' 	 80 	 s 	 	when	we	were	 design 	 ing 	 	 Bio 	 sphere 	 	2	,	we	had	to	ask	 our 	 selves 	 	some	pretty	basic	questions	.
I	mean	,	what	is	a	 bio 	 sphere 	 	?
Back	then	,	yes	,	I	guess	we	all	know	now	that	it	is	 essential 	 ly 	 	the	sphere	of	life	around	the	Earth	,	right	?
Well	,	you	have	to	get	a	little	more	specific	than	that	if	you	're	going	to	build	one	.
And	so	we	decided	that	what	it	 re 	 ally 	 	is	is	that	it	is	 entire 	 ly 	 	 material 	 ly 	 	closed	--	that	is	,	nothing	goes	in	or	out	at	all	,	no	material	--	and	 energetic 	 ally 	 	open	,	which	is	 essential 	 ly 	 	what	planet	Earth	is	.
This	is	a	chamber	that	was	1/400th	the	size	of	 Bio 	 sphere 	 	2	that	we	called	our	Test	Module	.
And	the	very	first	day	that	this	fellow	,	John	Allen	,	walked	in	,	to	spend	a	couple	of	days	in	there	with	all	the	plants	and	animals	and	bacteria	that	we	'd	put	in	there	to	 hopeful 	 ly 	 	keep	him	alive	,	the	doctors	were	 incredibl 	 y 	 	concerned	that	he	was	going	to	succumb	to	some	dreadful	toxin	,	or	that	his	lungs	were	going	to	get	 chok 	 ed 	 	with	bacteria	or	something	,	fungus	.
But	of	course	none	of	that	happened	.
And	over	the	 en 	 su 	 ing 	 	few	years	,	there	were	great	 saga 	 s 	 	about	 design 	 ing 	 	 Bio 	 sphere 	 	2	.
But	by	1991	we	finally	had	this	thing	built	.
And	it	was	time	for	us	to	go	in	and	give	it	a	go	.
We	needed	to	know	,	is	life	this	 malle 	 able 	 	?
Can	you	take	this	 bio 	 sphere 	 	,	that	has	evolved	on	a	planetary	scale	,	and	jam	it	into	a	little	bottle	,	and	will	it	survive	?
Big	questions	.
And	we	wanted	to	know	this	both	for	being	able	to	go	 s 	 omewhere 	 	else	in	the	universe	--	if	we	were	going	to	go	to	Mars	,	for	instance	,	would	we	take	a	 bio 	 sphere 	 	with	us	,	to	live	in	it	?
We	also	wanted	to	know	so	we	can	understand	more	about	the	Earth	that	we	all	live	in	.
Well	,	in	1991	it	was	finally	time	for	us	to	go	in	and	try	out	this	baby	.
Let	's	take	it	on	a	maiden	voyage	.
Will	it	work	?	Or	will	something	happen	that	we	ca	n't	understand	and	we	ca	n't	fix	,	 there 	 by 	 	 negat 	 ing 	 	the	concept	of	 man 	 - 	 made 	 	 bio 	 spheres 	 	?
So	eight	of	us	went	in	:	four	men	and	four	women	.
More	on	that	later	.
And	this	is	the	world	that	we	lived	in	.
So	,	on	the	top	,	we	had	these	beautiful	 rainforest 	 s 	 	and	an	ocean	,	and	 u 	 nderneath 	 	we	had	all	this	 techno 	 sphere 	 	,	we	called	it	,	which	is	where	all	the	pumps	and	the	valves	and	the	water	tanks	and	the	air	handlers	,	and	all	of	that	.
One	of	the	 Biospherian 	 s 	 	called	it	``	garden	of	Eden	on	top	of	an	aircraft	carrier	.	''
And	then	also	we	had	the	human	habitat	of	course	,	with	the	laboratories	,	and	all	of	that	.
This	is	the	agriculture	.
It	was	 essential 	 ly 	 	an	organic	farm	.
The	day	I	walked	into	 Bio 	 sphere 	 	2	,	I	was	,	for	the	first	time	,	breathing	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	atmosphere	than	everybody	else	in	the	world	,	except	seven	other	people	.
At	that	moment	I	became	part	of	that	 bio 	 sphere 	 	.
And	I	do	n't	mean	that	in	an	abstract	sense	;	I	mean	it	rather	literally	.
When	I	 breath 	 ed 	 	out	,	my	CO2	fed	the	sweet	potatoes	that	I	was	growing	.
And	we	ate	an	awful	lot	of	the	sweet	potatoes	.
And	those	sweet	potatoes	became	part	of	me	.
In	fact	,	we	ate	so	many	sweet	potatoes	I	became	orange	with	sweet	potato	.
I	literally	was	eating	the	same	carbon	over	and	over	again	.
I	was	eating	myself	in	some	strange	sort	of	bizarre	way	.
When	it	came	to	our	atmosphere	,	however	,	it	was	n't	that	much	of	a	joke	over	the	long	term	,	because	it	turned	out	that	we	were	losing	oxygen	,	quite	a	lot	of	oxygen	.
And	we	knew	that	we	were	losing	CO2	.
And	so	we	were	working	to	sequester	carbon	.
Good	lord	--	we	know	that	term	now	.
We	were	growing	plants	like	crazy	.
We	were	taking	their	biomass	,	 s 	 toring 	 	them	in	the	basement	,	growing	plants	,	going	around	,	around	,	around	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	take	all	of	that	carbon	out	of	the	atmosphere	.
We	were	 try 	 ing 	 	to	stop	carbon	from	going	into	the	atmosphere	.
We	stopped	 irrig 	 ating 	 	our	soil	,	as	much	as	we	could	.
We	stopped	tilling	,	so	that	we	could	prevent	 green 	 house 	 	 gasse 	 s 	 	from	going	into	the	air	.
But	our	oxygen	was	going	down	faster	than	our	CO2	was	going	up	,	which	was	quite	unexpected	,	because	we	had	seen	them	going	in	tandem	in	the	test	module	.
And	it	was	like	playing	atomic	 hide 	 - 	 and 	 - 	 seek 	 	.
We	had	lost	seven	tons	of	oxygen	.
And	we	had	no	clue	where	it	was	.
And	I	tell	you	,	when	you	lose	a	lot	of	oxygen	--	and	our	oxygen	went	down	quite	far	;	it	went	from	21	percent	down	to	14.2	percent	--	my	goodness	,	do	you	feel	dreadful	.
I	mean	we	were	 d 	 ragging 	 	 our 	 selves 	 	around	the	 Bio 	 sphere 	 	.
And	we	had	sleep	apnea	at	night	.
So	you	'd	wake	up	 gas 	 ping 	 	with	breath	,	because	your	blood	chemistry	has	changed	.
And	that	you	literally	do	that	.	You	stop	breathing	and	then	you	--	--	take	a	breath	and	it	 wake 	 s 	 	you	up	.	And	it	's	very	 irrit 	 ating 	 	.
And	everybody	outside	thought	we	were	dying	.
I	mean	,	the	media	was	making	it	sound	like	were	were	dying	.
And	I	had	to	call	up	my	mother	every	other	day	saying	,	``	No	,	Mum	,	it	's	fine	,	fine	.
We	're	not	dead	.	We	're	fine	.	We	're	fine	.	''
And	the	doctor	was	,	in	fact	,	checking	us	to	make	sure	we	were	,	in	fact	,	fine	.
But	in	fact	he	was	the	person	who	was	most	 susceptibl 	 e 	 	to	the	oxygen	.
And	one	day	he	could	n't	add	up	a	line	of	figures	.
And	it	was	time	for	us	to	put	oxygen	in	.
And	you	might	think	,	well	,	``	Boy	,	your	life	support	system	was	failing	you	.	Was	n't	that	dreadful	?	''
Yes	.	In	a	sense	it	was	 terr 	 ifying 	 	.
Except	that	I	knew	I	could	walk	out	the	 air 	 lock 	 	door	at	any	time	,	if	it	 re 	 ally 	 	got	bad	,	though	who	was	going	to	say	,	``	I	ca	n't	take	it	 any 	 more 	 	!	``	?
Not	me	,	that	was	for	sure	.
But	on	the	other	hand	,	it	was	the	scientific	gold	of	the	project	,	because	we	could	 re 	 ally 	 	crank	this	baby	up	,	as	a	scientific	tool	,	and	see	if	we	could	,	in	fact	,	find	where	those	seven	tons	of	oxygen	had	gone	.
And	we	did	 inde 	 ed 	 	find	it	.
And	we	found	it	in	the	concrete	.
Essentially	it	had	done	something	very	simple	.
We	had	put	too	much	carbon	in	the	soil	in	the	form	of	compost	.
It	broke	down	;	it	took	oxygen	out	of	the	air	;	it	put	CO2	into	the	air	;	and	it	went	into	the	concrete	.
Pretty	 s 	 traightforward 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	.
So	at	the	end	of	the	two	years	when	we	came	out	,	we	were	 e 	 lated 	 	,	because	,	in	fact	,	although	you	might	say	we	had	discovered	something	that	was	quite	``	uhh	,	''	when	your	oxygen	is	going	down	,	stopped	working	,	 essential 	 ly 	 	,	in	your	life	support	system	,	that	's	a	very	bad	failure	.
Except	that	we	knew	what	it	was	.	And	we	knew	how	to	fix	it	.
And	nothing	else	 e 	 merged 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	was	as	serious	as	that	.
And	we	proved	the	concept	,	more	or	less	.
People	,	on	the	other	hand	,	was	a	different	subject	.
We	were	--	yeah	I	do	n't	know	that	we	were	 fix 	 able 	 	.
We	all	went	quite	nuts	,	I	will	say	.
And	the	day	I	came	out	of	 Bio 	 sphere 	 	2	,	I	was	 thrill 	 ed 	 	I	was	going	to	see	all	my	family	and	my	friends	.
For	two	years	I	'd	been	seeing	people	through	the	glass	.
And	everybody	ran	up	to	me	.
And	I	 recoil 	 ed 	 	.	They	stank	!
People	stink	!
We	stink	of	 hair 	 spray 	 	and	 under 	 arm 	 	 de 	 odorant 	 	,	and	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	stuff	.
Now	we	had	stuff	inside	 Bio 	 sphere 	 	to	keep	 our 	 selves 	 	clean	,	but	nothing	with	 perfum 	 e 	 	.
And	boy	do	we	stink	out	here	.
Not	only	that	,	but	I	lost	touch	of	where	my	food	came	from	.
I	had	been	growing	all	my	own	food	.
I	had	no	idea	what	was	in	my	food	,	where	it	came	from	.
I	did	n't	even	 recogniz 	 e 	 	half	the	names	in	most	of	the	food	that	I	was	eating	.
In	fact	,	I	would	stand	for	hours	in	the	 aisle 	 s 	 	of	shops	,	reading	all	the	names	on	all	of	the	things	.
People	must	have	thought	I	was	nuts	.
It	was	 re 	 ally 	 	quite	 astonish 	 ing 	 	.
And	I	 slow 	 ly 	 	lost	track	of	where	I	was	in	this	big	 bio 	 sphere 	 	,	in	this	big	 bio 	 sphere 	 	that	we	all	live	in	.
In	 Bio 	 sphere 	 	2	I	totally	understood	that	I	had	a	huge	impact	on	my	 bio 	 sphere 	 	,	everyday	,	and	it	had	an	impact	on	me	,	very	 visceral 	 ly 	 	,	very	literally	.
So	I	went	about	my	business	:	Paragon	Space	Development	Corporation	,	a	little	firm	I	started	with	people	while	I	was	in	the	 Bio 	 sphere 	 	,	because	I	had	nothing	else	to	do	.
And	one	of	the	things	we	did	was	try	to	figure	out	:	how	small	can	you	make	these	 bio 	 spheres 	 	,	and	what	can	you	do	with	them	?
And	so	we	sent	one	onto	the	Mir	Space	Station	.
We	had	one	on	the	shuttle	and	one	on	the	International	Space	Station	,	for	16	months	,	where	we	managed	to	produce	the	first	organisms	to	go	through	complete	multiple	life	cycles	in	space	--	 re 	 ally 	 	 push 	 ing 	 	the	envelope	of	understanding	how	 malle 	 able 	 	our	life	systems	are	.
And	I	'm	also	proud	to	announce	that	you	're	getting	a	sneak	preview	--	on	Friday	we	're	going	to	announce	that	we	're	actually	forming	a	team	to	develop	a	system	to	grow	plants	on	the	Moon	,	which	is	going	to	be	pretty	fun	.
And	the	legacy	of	that	is	a	system	that	we	were	 design 	 ing 	 	:	an	 entire 	 ly 	 	sealed	system	to	grow	plants	to	grow	on	Mars	.
And	part	of	that	is	that	we	had	to	model	very	rapid	circulation	of	CO2	and	oxygen	and	water	through	this	plant	system	.
As	a	result	of	that	modeling	I	ended	up	in	all	places	,	in	Eritrea	,	in	the	Horn	of	Africa	.
Eritrea	,	formerly	part	of	Ethiopia	,	is	one	of	those	places	that	is	 astonish 	 ingly 	 	beautiful	,	 incredibl 	 y 	 	stark	,	and	I	have	no	understanding	of	how	people	eke	out	a	living	there	.
It	is	so	dry	.
This	is	what	I	saw	.
But	this	is	also	what	I	saw	.
I	saw	a	company	that	had	taken	 sea 	 water 	 	and	sand	,	and	they	were	growing	a	kind	of	crop	that	will	grow	on	pure	salt	water	without	having	to	treat	it	.
And	it	will	produce	a	food	crop	.
In	this	case	it	was	 oil 	 seed 	 	.
It	was	 astonish 	 ing 	 	.	They	were	also	producing	 mangrove 	 s 	 	in	a	plantation	.
And	the	 mangrove 	 s 	 	were	providing	wood	and	honey	and	leaves	for	the	animals	,	so	that	they	could	produce	milk	and	 what 	 not 	 	,	like	we	had	in	the	 Bio 	 sphere 	 	.
And	all	of	it	was	coming	from	this	:	shrimp	farms	.
Shrimp	farms	are	a	 s 	 courge 	 	on	the	earth	,	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	from	an	environmental	point	of	view	.
They	pour	huge	 amount 	 s 	 	of	 pollutant 	 s 	 	into	the	ocean	.
They	also	 pollut 	 e 	 	their	 next 	 - 	 door 	 	 neighbor 	 s 	 	.
So	they	're	all	 s 	 hitting 	 	each	other	's	ponds	,	quite	literally	.
And	what	this	project	was	 do 	 ing 	 	was	taking	the	effluent	of	these	,	and	turning	them	into	all	of	this	food	.
They	were	literally	turning	pollution	into	abundance	for	a	desert	people	.
They	had	created	an	industrial	ecosystem	,	of	a	sense	.
I	was	there	because	I	was	actually	modeling	the	mangrove	portion	for	a	carbon	credit	program	,	under	the	U.N	.
Kyoto	Protocol	system	.
And	as	I	was	modeling	this	mangrove	swamp	,	I	was	thinking	to	myself	,	``	How	do	you	put	a	box	around	this	?	''
When	I	'm	modeling	a	plant	in	a	box	,	literally	,	I	know	where	to	draw	the	boundary	.
In	a	mangrove	forest	like	this	I	have	no	idea	.
Well	,	of	course	you	have	to	draw	the	boundary	around	the	whole	of	the	Earth	.
And	understand	its	interactions	with	the	entire	Earth	.
And	put	your	project	in	that	context	.
Around	the	world	today	we	're	seeing	an	 incredibl 	 e 	 	transformation	,	from	what	I	would	call	a	 bio 	 cidal 	 	species	,	one	that	--	whether	we	 intentional 	 ly 	 	or	 un 	 intentional 	 ly 	 	--	have	designed	our	systems	to	kill	life	,	a	lot	of	the	time	.
This	is	in	fact	,	this	beautiful	photograph	,	is	in	fact	over	the	Amazon	.
And	here	the	light	green	are	areas	of	massive	 de 	 forestation 	 	.
And	those	beautiful	 wisp 	 y 	 	clouds	are	,	in	fact	,	fires	,	 human 	 - 	 made 	 	fires	.
We	're	in	the	process	of	 transform 	 ing 	 	from	this	,	to	what	I	would	call	a	 bi 	 ophilic 	 	society	,	one	where	we	learn	to	 nurtur 	 e 	 	society	.
Now	it	may	not	seem	like	it	,	but	we	are	.
It	is	happening	all	across	the	world	,	in	every	kind	of	walk	of	life	,	and	every	kind	of	career	and	industry	that	you	can	think	of	.
And	I	think	often	times	people	get	lost	in	that	.
They	go	,	``	But	how	can	I	possibly	find	my	way	in	that	?
It	's	such	a	huge	subject	.	''
And	I	would	say	that	the	small	stuff	counts	.	It	 re 	 ally 	 	does	.
This	is	the	story	of	a	rake	in	my	backyard	.
This	was	my	backyard	,	very	early	on	,	when	I	bought	my	property	.
And	in	Arizona	,	of	course	,	everybody	puts	gravel	down	.
And	they	like	to	keep	everything	 beautiful 	 ly 	 	 rak 	 ed 	 	.	And	they	keep	all	the	leaves	away	.
And	on	Sunday	morning	the	 neighbor 	 s 	 	leaf	blower	comes	out	,	and	I	want	to	throttle	them	.
It	's	a	certain	type	of	aesthetic	.
We	're	very	 un 	 comfortabl 	 e 	 	with	 un 	 tid 	 iness 	 	.
And	I	threw	away	my	rake	.
And	I	let	all	of	the	leaves	fall	from	the	trees	that	I	have	on	my	property	.
And	over	time	,	 essential 	 ly 	 	what	have	I	been	 do 	 ing 	 	?
I	've	been	building	 top 	 soil 	 	.
And	so	now	all	the	birds	come	in	.	And	I	have	hawks	.
And	I	have	an	oasis	.
This	is	what	 happen 	 s 	 	every	spring	.	For	six	weeks	,	six	to	eight	weeks	,	I	have	this	flush	of	green	oasis	.
This	is	actually	in	a	 ripar 	 ian 	 	area	.
And	all	of	Tucson	could	be	like	this	if	everybody	would	just	revolt	and	throw	away	the	rake	.
The	small	stuff	counts	.
The	Industrial	Revolution	--	and	Prometheus	--	has	given	us	this	,	the	ability	to	light	up	the	world	.
It	has	also	given	us	this	,	the	ability	to	look	at	the	world	from	the	outside	.
Now	we	may	not	all	have	another	 bio 	 sphere 	 	that	we	can	run	to	,	and	compare	it	to	this	 bio 	 sphere 	 	.
But	we	can	look	at	the	world	,	and	try	to	understand	where	we	are	in	its	context	,	and	how	we	choose	to	interact	with	it	.
And	if	you	lose	where	you	are	in	your	 bio 	 sphere 	 	,	or	are	 perhap 	 s 	 	having	a	 difficult 	 y 	 	 connect 	 ing 	 	with	where	you	are	in	the	 bio 	 sphere 	 	,	I	would	say	to	you	,	take	a	deep	breath	.
The	 yogi 	 s 	 	had	it	right	.
Breath	does	,	in	fact	,	connect	us	all	in	a	very	literal	way	.
Take	a	breath	now	.
And	as	you	breathe	,	think	about	what	is	in	your	breath	.
There	 perhap 	 s 	 	is	the	CO2	from	the	person	sitting	 next 	 - 	 door 	 	to	you	.
Maybe	there	is	a	little	bit	of	oxygen	from	some	algae	on	the	beach	not	far	from	here	.
It	also	 connect 	 s 	 	us	in	time	.
There	may	be	some	carbon	in	your	breath	from	the	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	.
There	could	also	be	carbon	that	you	are	 exhal 	 ing 	 	now	that	will	be	in	the	breath	of	your	 great 	 - 	 great 	 - 	 great 	 - 	 grandchildren 	 	.
Thank	you	.

Dennis	 van 	 Engel 	 sdorp 	 	:	a	plea	for	bees
What	I	'd	like	you	to	do	is	,	just	 re 	 ally 	 	quickly	,	is	just	,	sort	of	,	nod	to	the	person	on	your	right	,	and	then	nod	to	the	person	on	your	left	.
Now	,	 chance 	 s 	 	are	that	over	the	last	winter	,	if	you	had	been	a	beehive	,	either	you	or	one	of	the	two	people	you	just	 no 	 dded 	 	at	would	have	died	.
Now	,	that	's	an	awful	lot	of	bees	.
And	this	is	the	second	year	in	a	row	we	have	lost	over	30	percent	of	the	colonies	,	or	we	estimate	we	've	lost	30	percent	of	the	colonies	over	the	winter	.
Now	,	that	's	a	lot	,	a	lot	of	bees	,	and	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	important	.
And	most	of	those	losses	are	because	of	things	we	know	.
We	know	that	there	are	these	 var 	 roa 	 	mites	that	have	introduced	and	caused	a	lot	of	losses	,	and	we	also	have	this	new	phenomenon	,	which	I	talked	about	last	year	,	Colony	Collapse	Disorder	.
And	here	we	see	a	picture	on	top	of	a	hill	in	Central	Valley	last	December	.
And	below	,	you	can	see	all	these	out	yards	,	or	temporary	yards	,	where	the	colonies	are	brought	in	until	February	,	and	then	they	're	shipped	out	to	the	 almond 	 s 	 	.
And	one	documentary	writer	,	who	was	here	and	looked	at	this	two	months	after	I	was	here	,	described	this	not	as	 beehive 	 s 	 	but	as	a	graveyard	,	with	these	empty	white	boxes	with	no	bees	left	in	them	.
Now	,	I	'm	going	to	sum	up	a	year	's	worth	of	work	in	two	 sentence 	 s 	 	to	say	that	we	have	been	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	what	the	cause	of	this	is	.
And	what	we	know	is	that	it	's	as	if	the	bees	have	caught	a	flu	.
And	this	flu	has	wiped	through	the	population	of	bees	.
In	some	cases	,	and	in	fact	in	most	cases	in	one	year	,	this	flu	was	caused	by	a	new	virus	to	us	,	or	newly	identified	by	us	,	called	Israeli	Acute	 Para 	 lysis 	 	virus	.
It	was	called	that	because	a	guy	in	Israel	first	found	it	,	and	he	now	 regret 	 s 	 	 profound 	 ly 	 	calling	it	that	disease	,	because	,	of	course	,	there	's	the	implication	.
But	we	think	this	virus	is	pretty	 ubiquit 	 ous 	 	.
It	's	also	pretty	clear	that	the	bees	sometimes	catch	other	viruses	or	other	 flu 	 s 	 	,	and	so	the	question	we	're	still	 strugg 	 ling 	 	with	,	and	the	question	that	keeps	us	up	at	night	,	is	why	have	the	bees	 sudden 	 ly 	 	become	so	 susceptibl 	 e 	 	to	this	flu	,	and	why	are	they	so	 susceptibl 	 e 	 	to	these	other	diseases	?
And	we	do	n't	have	the	answer	to	that	yet	,	and	we	spend	a	lot	of	time	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	that	out	.
We	think	 perhap 	 s 	 	it	's	a	combination	of	factors	.
We	know	from	the	work	of	a	very	large	and	dynamic	working	team	that	,	you	know	,	we	're	finding	a	lot	of	different	 pesticide 	 s 	 	in	the	hive	,	and	 s 	 urprisingly 	 	,	sometimes	the	 health 	 iest 	 	 hive 	 s 	 	have	the	most	 pesticide 	 s 	 	.	And	so	we	discover	all	these	very	strange	things	that	we	ca	n't	begin	to	understand	.
And	so	this	opens	up	the	whole	idea	of	looking	at	colony	health	.
Now	of	course	,	if	you	lose	a	lot	of	colonies	,	 bee 	 keepers 	 	can	replace	them	very	quickly	.
And	that	's	why	we	've	been	able	to	recover	from	a	lot	of	loss	.
If	we	lost	one	in	every	three	cows	in	the	winter	,	you	know	,	the	National	Guard	would	be	out	.
But	what	 bee 	 keepers 	 	can	do	is	,	if	they	have	one	 surviv 	 ing 	 	colony	,	they	can	split	that	colony	in	two	.
And	then	the	one	half	that	does	n't	have	a	queen	,	they	can	buy	a	queen	.
It	comes	in	the	mail	;	it	can	come	from	Australia	or	Hawaii	or	Florida	,	and	you	can	 introduc 	 e 	 	that	queen	.
And	in	fact	,	America	was	the	first	country	that	ever	did	 mail 	 - 	 delivery 	 	queens	and	in	fact	,	it	's	part	of	the	postal	code	that	you	have	to	deliver	queens	by	mail	in	order	to	make	sure	that	we	have	enough	bees	in	this	country	.
If	you	do	n't	just	want	a	queen	,	you	can	buy	,	actually	,	a	 three 	 - 	 pound 	 	package	of	bees	,	which	comes	in	the	mail	,	and	of	course	,	the	Postal	Office	is	always	very	concerned	when	they	get	,	you	know	,	your	 three 	 - 	 pound 	 	 package 	 s 	 	of	bees	.
And	you	can	install	this	in	your	hive	and	replace	that	 dead 	 - 	 out 	 	.
So	it	means	that	 bee 	 keepers 	 	are	very	good	at	 replac 	 ing 	 	 dead 	 - 	 outs 	 	,	and	so	they	've	been	able	to	cover	those	losses	.
So	even	though	we	've	lost	30	percent	of	the	colonies	every	year	,	the	same	number	of	colonies	have	existed	in	the	country	,	at	about	2.4	million	colonies	.
Now	,	those	losses	are	tragic	on	many	 front 	 s 	 	,	and	one	of	those	 front 	 s 	 	is	for	the	 bee 	 keeper 	 	.
And	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	important	to	talk	about	 bee 	 keepers 	 	first	,	because	 bee 	 keepers 	 	are	among	the	most	 fascina 	 ting 	 	people	you	'll	ever	meet	.
If	this	was	a	group	of	 bee 	 keepers 	 	,	you	would	have	everyone	from	the	 card 	 - 	 carrying 	 	NRA	member	who	's	,	you	know	,	live	free	or	die	,	to	the	,	you	know	,	the	 self 	 - 	 expressed 	 	 quirk 	 y 	 	San	Francisco	backyard	pig	farmer	.
And	you	get	all	of	these	people	in	the	same	room	,	and	they	're	all	engaged	and	they	're	getting	along	,	and	they	're	all	there	because	of	the	passion	for	bees	.
Now	,	there	's	another	part	of	that	community	which	are	the	commercial	 bee 	 keepers 	 	,	the	ones	who	make	their	 live 	 lihood 	 	from	 bee 	 keeping 	 	alone	.
And	these	tend	to	be	some	of	the	most	independent	,	 ten 	 acious 	 	,	intuitive	,	you	know	,	 in 	 ventive 	 	people	you	will	ever	meet	.
They	're	just	 fascina 	 ting 	 	.	And	they	're	like	that	all	over	the	world	.
I	had	the	privilege	of	working	in	Haiti	just	for	two	weeks	earlier	this	year	.
And	Haiti	,	if	you	've	ever	been	there	,	is	just	a	tragedy	.
I	mean	,	there	may	be	100	 explanation 	 s 	 	for	why	Haiti	is	the	 impoverish 	 ed 	 	nation	it	is	,	but	there	is	no	excuse	to	see	that	sort	of	squalor	.
But	you	meet	this	 bee 	 keeper 	 	,	and	I	met	this	 bee 	 keeper 	 	here	,	and	he	is	one	of	the	most	 knowledge 	 able 	 	 bee 	 keepers 	 	I	've	ever	met	.
No	formal	education	,	but	very	 knowledge 	 able 	 	.
We	needed	 bees 	 wax 	 	for	a	project	we	were	working	on	;	he	was	so	capable	,	he	was	able	to	render	the	 nice 	 st 	 	block	of	 bees 	 wax 	 	I	have	ever	seen	from	cow	dung	,	tin	cans	and	his	veil	,	which	he	used	as	a	screening	,	right	in	this	meadow	.	And	so	that	 in 	 genuity 	 	is	 inspir 	 ing 	 	.
We	also	have	Dave	 Hack 	 enberg 	 	,	who	is	the	poster	child	of	CCD	.
He	's	the	one	who	first	identified	this	condition	and	raised	the	alarm	bells	.
And	he	has	a	history	of	these	trucks	,	and	he	's	moved	these	bees	up	and	down	the	coast	.
And	a	lot	of	people	talk	about	trucks	and	moving	bees	,	and	that	being	bad	,	but	we	've	done	that	for	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	years	.
The	ancient	 Egyptian 	 s 	 	used	to	move	bees	up	and	down	the	Nile	on	rafts	,	so	this	idea	of	a	movable	bee	force	is	not	new	at	all	.
And	one	of	our	real	 wor 	 ries 	 	with	Colony	Collapse	Disorder	is	the	fact	that	it	costs	so	much	money	to	replace	those	 dead 	 - 	 out 	 	colonies	.
And	you	can	do	that	one	year	in	a	row	,	you	may	be	able	to	do	it	two	years	in	a	row	.
But	if	you	're	losing	50	percent	to	80	percent	of	your	colonies	,	you	ca	n't	survive	three	years	in	a	row	.	And	we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	worried	about	losing	this	segment	of	our	industry	.
And	that	's	important	for	many	 front 	 s 	 	,	and	one	of	them	is	because	of	that	culture	that	's	in	agriculture	.
And	these	migratory	 bee 	 keepers 	 	are	the	last	nomads	of	America	.
You	know	,	they	pick	up	their	 hive 	 s 	 	;	they	move	their	families	once	or	twice	in	a	year	.
And	if	you	look	at	Florida	,	in	Dade	City	,	Florida	,	that	's	where	all	the	Pennsylvania	 bee 	 keepers 	 	go	.
And	then	20	miles	down	the	road	is	 Grove 	 land 	 	,	and	that	's	where	all	the	Wisconsin	 bee 	 keepers 	 	go	.
And	if	you	're	ever	in	Central	Valley	in	February	,	you	go	to	this	café	at	10	o'clock	in	the	morning	,	Kathy	and	Kate	's	.
And	that	's	where	all	the	 bee 	 keepers 	 	come	after	a	night	of	moving	bees	into	the	almond	 grove 	 s 	 	.
They	all	have	their	breakfast	and	complain	about	everyone	right	there	.	And	it	's	a	great	experience	,	and	I	 re 	 ally 	 	encourage	you	to	drop	in	at	that	diner	during	that	time	,	because	that	's	quite	essential	American	experience	.
And	we	see	these	families	,	these	nomadic	families	,	you	know	,	father	to	son	,	father	to	son	,	and	these	guys	are	 hurt 	 ing 	 	.
And	they	're	not	people	who	like	to	ask	for	help	,	although	they	are	the	most	helpful	people	ever	.
If	there	's	one	guy	who	 lose 	 s 	 	all	his	bees	because	of	a	truck	overhaul	,	everyone	pitches	in	and	gives	20	 hive 	 s 	 	to	help	him	replace	those	lost	colonies	.
And	so	,	it	's	a	very	dynamic	,	and	I	think	,	historic	and	 excit 	 ing 	 	community	to	be	involved	with	.
Of	course	,	the	real	importance	for	bees	is	not	the	honey	.
And	although	I	highly	encourage	you	,	all	use	honey	.
I	mean	,	it	's	the	most	ethical	 sweeten 	 er 	 	,	and	you	know	,	it	's	a	dynamic	and	fun	 sweeten 	 er 	 	.
But	we	estimate	that	about	one	in	three	bites	of	food	we	eat	is	directly	or	 in 	 directly 	 	 pollinat 	 ed 	 	by	 honey 	 bees 	 	.
So	if	we	did	not	have	bees	,	it	's	not	like	we	would	 star 	 ve 	 	,	but	 clear 	 ly 	 	our	diet	would	be	diminished	.
It	's	said	that	for	bees	,	the	flower	is	the	fountain	of	life	,	and	for	flowers	bees	are	the	 messenger 	 s 	 	of	love	.
And	that	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	great	expression	,	because	 re 	 ally 	 	,	bees	are	the	sex	workers	for	flowers	.	They	are	,	you	know	--	they	get	paid	for	their	services	.
They	get	paid	by	pollen	and	nectar	,	to	move	that	male	sperm	,	the	pollen	,	from	flower	to	flower	.
And	there	are	flowers	that	are	 self 	 - 	 in 	 fertile 	 	.	That	means	they	ca	n't	--	the	pollen	in	their	bloom	ca	n't	 fertil 	 ize 	 	themselves	.
So	in	an	apple	orchard	,	for	instance	,	you	'll	have	rows	of	10	 apple 	 s 	 	of	one	variety	,	and	then	you	have	another	apple	tree	that	's	a	different	type	of	pollen	.
And	bees	are	very	faithful	.
When	they	're	out	 pollinat 	 ing 	 	or	gathering	pollen	from	one	flower	,	they	stay	to	that	crop	 exclusive 	 ly 	 	,	in	order	to	help	generate	.
And	of	course	,	they	're	made	to	carry	this	pollen	.
They	build	up	a	static	electric	charge	and	the	pollen	jumps	on	them	and	 help 	 s 	 	spread	that	pollen	from	bloom	to	bloom	.
However	,	 honey 	 bees 	 	are	a	minority	.
 Honey 	 bees 	 	are	not	native	to	America	;	they	were	introduced	with	the	 colonial 	 ists 	 	.
And	there	are	actually	more	species	of	bees	than	there	are	mammals	and	birds	combined	.
In	Pennsylvania	alone	,	we	have	been	surveying	bees	for	150	years	,	and	very	 intense 	 ly 	 	in	the	last	three	years	.
We	have	identified	over	400	species	of	bees	in	Pennsylvania	.
 Thirty 	 - 	 two 	 	species	have	not	been	identified	or	found	in	the	state	since	1950	.
Now	,	that	could	be	because	we	have	n't	been	sampling	right	,	but	it	does	,	I	think	,	suggest	that	something	's	wrong	with	the	 pollinat 	 or 	 	force	.	And	these	bees	are	 fascina 	 ting 	 	.
We	have	 bumblebee 	 s 	 	on	the	top	.
And	 bumblebee 	 s 	 	are	what	we	call	 eu 	 social 	 	:	they	're	not	 tru 	 ly 	 	social	,	because	only	the	queen	is	,	over	winter	.
We	also	have	the	sweat	bees	,	and	these	are	little	gems	flying	around	.
They	're	like	tiny	little	flies	and	they	fly	around	.
And	then	you	have	another	type	of	bee	,	which	we	call	 klepto 	 parasites 	 	,	which	is	a	very	fancy	way	of	saying	,	 bad 	 - 	 minded 	 	,	 murder 	 ing 	 	--	what	's	the	word	I	'm	looking	for	?	 Murder 	 ing 	 	--	Audience	:	Bee	?
Dennis	 van 	 Engel 	 sdorp 	 	:	Bee	.	Okay	,	thanks	.
What	these	bees	do	is	,	they	sit	there	.	These	 sol 	 itary 	 	bees	,	they	drill	a	hole	in	the	ground	or	drill	a	hole	in	a	branch	,	and	they	collect	pollen	and	make	it	into	a	ball	,	and	they	lay	an	egg	on	it	.
Well	,	these	bees	hang	out	at	that	hole	,	and	they	wait	for	that	mother	to	fly	away	,	they	go	in	,	eat	the	egg	,	and	lay	their	own	egg	there	.	So	they	do	n't	do	any	work	.
And	so	,	in	fact	,	if	you	know	you	have	these	 klepto 	 parasitic 	 	bees	,	you	know	that	your	environment	is	healthy	,	because	they	're	 top 	 - 	 of 	 - 	 the 	 - 	 food 	 - 	 chain 	 	bees	.
And	in	fact	,	there	is	now	a	red	list	of	 pollinat 	 ors 	 	that	we	're	worried	have	 disappear 	 ed 	 	,	and	on	top	of	that	list	are	a	lot	of	these	 klepto 	 parasites 	 	,	but	also	these	 bumblebee 	 s 	 	.
And	in	fact	,	if	you	guys	live	on	the	West	Coast	,	go	to	these	 website 	 s 	 	here	,	and	they	're	 re 	 ally 	 	looking	for	people	to	look	for	some	of	these	 bumblebee 	 s 	 	,	because	we	think	some	have	gone	extinct	.	Or	some	,	the	population	has	declined	.
And	so	it	's	not	just	 honey 	 bees 	 	that	are	in	trouble	,	but	we	do	n't	understand	these	native	 pollinat 	 ors 	 	or	all	those	other	parts	of	our	community	.
And	of	course	,	bees	are	not	the	only	important	factor	here	.
There	are	other	animals	that	 pollinat 	 e 	 	,	like	bats	,	and	bats	are	in	trouble	too	.
And	I	'm	glad	I	'm	a	bee	man	and	not	a	bat	man	,	because	there	's	no	money	to	research	the	bat	problems	.
And	bats	are	dying	at	an	 extraordinar 	 y 	 	rate	.
 White 	 - 	 nose 	 	syndrome	has	wiped	out	 population 	 s 	 	of	bats	.
If	there	's	a	cave	in	New	York	that	had	15,000	bats	in	it	,	and	there	are	1,000	left	.	That	's	like	San	Francisco	becoming	the	population	of	half	of	this	county	in	three	years	.
And	so	that	's	 incredibl 	 e 	 	.	And	there	's	no	money	to	do	that	.
But	I	'm	glad	to	say	that	I	think	we	know	the	cause	of	all	these	conditions	,	and	that	cause	is	NDD	:	Nature	Deficit	Disorder	.
And	that	is	that	I	think	that	what	we	have	in	our	society	is	,	we	forgot	our	connection	with	nature	.
And	I	think	if	we	 re 	 connect 	 	to	nature	,	we	'll	be	able	to	have	the	resources	and	that	interest	to	solve	these	problems	.
And	I	think	that	there	is	an	easy	cure	for	NDD	.
And	that	is	,	make	 meadow 	 s 	 	and	not	 lawn 	 s 	 	.
And	I	think	we	have	lost	our	connection	,	and	this	is	a	wonderful	way	of	 re 	 connect 	 ing 	 	to	our	environment	.
I	've	had	the	privilege	of	living	by	a	meadow	for	the	last	little	while	,	and	it	is	 terri 	 bly 	 	engaging	.
And	if	we	look	at	the	history	of	 lawn 	 s 	 	,	it	's	actually	rather	tragic	.
It	used	to	be	,	two	,	three	hundred	years	ago	,	that	a	lawn	was	a	symbol	of	prestige	,	and	so	it	was	only	the	very	rich	that	could	keep	these	green	actually	,	 desert 	 s 	 	:	they	're	totally	sterile	.
Americans	spent	,	in	2001	--	11	percent	of	all	pesticide	use	was	done	on	 lawn 	 s 	 	.
Five	percent	of	our	 green 	 house 	 	gases	are	produced	by	 mow 	 ing 	 	our	 lawn 	 s 	 	.
And	so	it	's	 incredibl 	 e 	 	the	amount	of	resources	we	've	spent	keeping	our	 lawn 	 s 	 	,	which	are	these	useless	 bio 	 systems 	 	.
And	so	we	need	to	 re 	 think 	 	this	idea	.
In	fact	,	you	know	,	the	White	House	used	to	have	sheep	in	front	in	order	to	help	fund	the	war	effort	in	World	War	I	,	which	probably	is	not	a	bad	idea	;	it	would	n't	be	a	bad	idea	.
I	want	to	say	this	not	because	I	'm	opposed	 complete 	 ly 	 	to	 mow 	 ing 	 	 lawn 	 s 	 	.
I	think	that	there	is	 perhap 	 s 	 	some	advantage	to	keeping	 lawn 	 s 	 	at	a	limited	scale	,	and	I	think	we	're	encouraged	to	do	that	.
But	I	also	want	to	reinforce	some	of	the	ideas	we	've	heard	here	,	because	having	a	meadow	or	living	by	a	meadow	is	 transformation 	 al 	 	.
That	it	is	amazing	that	connection	we	can	have	with	what	's	there	.
These	 milk 	 weed 	 	plants	have	grown	up	in	my	meadow	over	the	last	four	years	.	Add	to	watch	the	different	plants	,	or	 insect 	 s 	 	,	that	come	to	these	flowers	,	to	watch	that	--	and	we	've	heard	about	,	you	know	,	this	relationship	you	can	have	with	wine	,	this	companion	you	can	have	as	it	 mature 	 s 	 	and	as	it	has	these	different	 fragrance 	 s 	 	.
And	this	is	a	companion	,	and	this	is	a	relationship	that	never	dries	up	.
You	never	run	out	of	that	companion	as	you	drink	this	wine	,	too	.
And	I	encourage	you	to	look	at	that	.
Now	,	not	all	of	us	have	 meadow 	 s 	 	,	or	 lawn 	 s 	 	that	we	can	convert	,	and	so	you	can	always	,	of	course	,	grow	a	meadow	in	a	pot	.
Bees	 apparent 	 ly 	 	,	can	be	the	gateway	to	,	you	know	,	other	things	.
So	I	'm	not	saying	that	you	should	plant	a	meadow	of	pot	,	but	a	pot	in	a	meadow	.
But	you	can	also	have	this	great	community	of	city	or	 building 	 - 	 top 	 	 bee 	 keepers 	 	,	these	 bee 	 keepers 	 	that	live	--	This	is	in	Paris	where	these	 bee 	 keepers 	 	live	.
And	everyone	should	open	a	beehive	,	because	it	is	the	most	amazing	,	 incredibl 	 e 	 	thing	.
And	if	we	want	to	cure	 our 	 selves 	 	of	NDD	,	or	Nature	Deficit	Disorder	,	I	think	this	is	a	great	way	of	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
Get	a	beehive	and	grow	a	meadow	,	and	watch	that	life	come	back	into	your	life	.
And	so	with	that	,	I	think	that	what	we	can	do	,	if	we	do	this	,	we	can	make	sure	that	our	future	--	our	more	perfect	future	--	includes	 bee 	 keepers 	 	and	it	includes	bees	and	it	includes	those	 meadow 	 s 	 	.
And	that	journey	--	that	journey	of	transformation	that	occurs	as	you	grow	your	meadow	and	as	you	keep	your	bees	or	you	watch	those	native	bees	there	--	is	an	 extreme 	 ly 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	one	.
And	I	hope	that	you	experience	it	and	I	hope	you	tell	me	about	it	one	day	.
So	thank	you	very	much	for	being	here	.	Thank	you	very	much	.

David	Deutsch	:	A	new	way	to	explain	explanation
I	'm	sure	that	,	throughout	the	 hundred 	 - 	 thousand 	 - 	 odd 	 	years	of	our	species	'	existence	,	and	even	before	,	our	 ancestor 	 s 	 	looked	up	at	the	night	sky	,	and	 wonder 	 ed 	 	what	stars	are	.
 Wonder 	 ing 	 	,	therefore	,	how	to	explain	what	they	saw	in	terms	of	things	unseen	.
Okay	,	so	,	most	people	only	 wonder 	 ed 	 	that	 occasion 	 ally 	 	,	like	today	,	in	breaks	from	whatever	 normal 	 ly 	 	 pre 	 occupied 	 	them	.
But	what	 normal 	 ly 	 	 pre 	 occupied 	 	them	also	involved	 y 	 earning 	 	to	know	.
They	 wish 	 ed 	 	they	knew	how	to	prevent	their	food	supply	from	sometimes	failing	,	and	how	they	could	rest	when	they	were	tired	without	 risk 	 ing 	 	 star 	 vation 	 	,	be	warmer	,	cooler	,	 sa 	 fer 	 	,	in	less	pain	.
I	bet	those	 pre 	 historic 	 	cave	artists	would	have	loved	to	know	how	to	draw	better	.
In	every	aspect	of	their	lives	,	they	 wish 	 ed 	 	for	progress	,	just	as	we	do	.
But	they	failed	,	almost	 complete 	 ly 	 	,	to	make	any	.
They	did	n't	know	how	to	.
Discoveries	like	fire	happened	so	 rare 	 ly 	 	,	that	from	an	individual	's	point	of	view	,	the	world	never	 improv 	 ed 	 	.
Nothing	new	was	learned	.
The	first	clue	to	the	origin	of	 star 	 light 	 	happened	as	 recent 	 ly 	 	as	1899	:	 radio 	 activity 	 	.
Within	40	years	,	 physicist 	 s 	 	discovered	the	whole	explanation	,	expressed	,	as	usual	,	in	elegant	symbols	.
But	never	mind	the	symbols	.
Think	how	many	 discoverie 	 s 	 	they	represent	.
Nuclei	and	nuclear	reactions	,	of	course	.
But	 isotope 	 s 	 	,	particles	of	electricity	,	 a 	 ntimatter 	 	,	 neutrino 	 s 	 	,	the	conversion	of	mass	to	energy	--	that	's	 E 	 = 	 mc 	 ^ 	 2 	 	--	gamma	rays	,	transmutation	.
That	ancient	dream	that	had	always	 e 	 luded 	 	the	 al 	 chemist 	 s 	 	was	achieved	through	these	same	theories	that	explained	 star 	 light 	 	and	other	ancient	 mysterie 	 s 	 	,	and	new	,	unexpected	phenomena	.
That	all	that	,	discovered	in	40	years	,	had	not	been	in	the	previous	hundred	thousand	,	was	not	for	lack	of	thinking	about	stars	,	and	all	those	other	urgent	problems	they	had	.
They	even	 arriv 	 ed 	 	at	answers	,	such	as	myths	,	that	dominated	their	lives	,	yet	bore	almost	no	 re 	 semblance 	 	to	the	truth	.
The	tragedy	of	that	 protract 	 ed 	 	 stagn 	 ation 	 	is	n't	 sufficient 	 ly 	 	recognized	,	I	think	.
These	were	people	with	brains	of	 essential 	 ly 	 	the	same	design	that	 eventual 	 ly 	 	did	discover	all	those	things	.
But	that	ability	to	make	progress	remained	almost	 un 	 used 	 	,	until	the	event	that	 revolution 	 ized 	 	the	human	condition	and	changed	the	universe	.
Or	so	we	should	hope	.
Because	that	event	was	the	Scientific	Revolution	,	ever	since	which	our	knowledge	of	the	physical	world	,	and	of	how	to	adapt	it	to	our	wishes	,	has	been	growing	 relentless 	 ly 	 	.
Now	,	what	had	changed	?
What	were	people	now	 do 	 ing 	 	for	the	first	time	that	made	that	difference	between	 stagn 	 ation 	 	and	rapid	,	 open 	 - 	 ended 	 	discovery	?
How	to	make	that	difference	is	 sure 	 ly 	 	the	most	important	universal	truth	that	it	is	possible	to	know	.
 Worry 	 ingly 	 	,	there	is	no	consensus	about	what	it	is	.
So	,	I	'll	tell	you	.
But	I	'll	have	to	backtrack	a	little	first	.
Before	the	Scientific	Revolution	,	they	believed	that	everything	important	,	 know 	 able 	 	,	was	already	known	,	 enshrine 	 d 	 	in	ancient	 writing 	 s 	 	,	institutions	,	and	in	some	 genuine 	 ly 	 	useful	rules	of	thumb	--	which	were	,	however	,	 entrench 	 ed 	 	as	 dogma 	 s 	 	,	along	with	many	 falsehood 	 s 	 	.
So	they	believed	that	knowledge	came	from	authorities	that	actually	knew	very	little	.
And	therefore	progress	 depend 	 ed 	 	on	learning	how	to	reject	the	authority	of	learned	men	,	priests	,	traditions	and	 ruler 	 s 	 	.
Which	is	why	the	Scientific	Revolution	had	to	have	a	wider	context	.
The	Enlightenment	,	a	revolution	in	how	people	sought	knowledge	,	 try 	 ing 	 	not	to	 re 	 ly 	 	on	authority	.
``	Take	no	one	's	word	for	it	.	''
But	that	ca	n't	be	what	made	the	difference	.
Authorities	had	been	 reject 	 ed 	 	before	,	many	times	.
And	that	 rare 	 ly 	 	,	if	ever	,	caused	anything	like	the	Scientific	Revolution	.
At	the	time	,	what	they	thought	 distinguish 	 ed 	 	science	was	a	radical	idea	about	things	unseen	,	known	as	empiricism	.
All	knowledge	 derive 	 s 	 	from	the	senses	.
Well	,	we	've	seen	that	that	ca	n't	be	true	.
It	did	help	by	 promot 	 ing 	 	observation	and	experiment	.
But	,	from	the	 out 	 set 	 	,	it	was	obvious	that	there	was	something	 horr 	 ibly 	 	wrong	with	it	.
Knowledge	comes	from	the	senses	.
In	what	language	?	 Certain 	 ly 	 	not	the	language	of	mathematics	,	in	which	,	Galileo	 right 	 ly 	 	said	,	the	book	of	nature	is	written	.
Look	at	the	world	.	You	do	n't	see	equations	carved	on	to	the	 mountain 	 sides 	 	.
If	you	did	,	it	would	be	because	people	had	carved	them	.
By	the	way	,	why	do	n't	we	do	that	?
What	's	wrong	with	us	?
 Empiric 	 ism 	 	is	 in 	 adequate 	 	because	,	well	,	scientific	theories	explain	the	seen	in	terms	of	the	unseen	.
And	the	unseen	,	you	have	to	admit	,	does	n't	come	to	us	through	the	senses	.
We	do	n't	see	those	nuclear	reactions	in	stars	.
We	do	n't	see	the	origin	of	species	.
We	do	n't	see	the	curvature	of	 space 	 - 	 time 	 	,	and	other	 universe 	 s 	 	.
But	we	know	about	those	things	.
How	?
Well	,	the	classic	 empiric 	 ist 	 	answer	is	induction	.
The	unseen	 resembl 	 es 	 	the	seen	.
But	it	does	n't	.
You	know	what	the	 clinch 	 ing 	 	evidence	was	that	 space 	 - 	 time 	 	is	curved	?
It	was	a	photograph	,	not	of	 space 	 - 	 time 	 	,	but	of	an	eclipse	,	with	a	dot	there	rather	than	there	.
And	the	evidence	for	evolution	?
Some	rocks	and	some	finches	.
And	parallel	 universe 	 s 	 	?	Again	:	dots	there	,	rather	than	there	,	on	a	screen	.
What	we	see	,	in	all	these	cases	,	bears	no	 re 	 semblance 	 	to	the	reality	that	we	 conclud 	 e 	 	is	 responsibl 	 e 	 	--	only	a	long	chain	of	theoretical	reasoning	and	interpretation	 connect 	 s 	 	them	.
``	Ah	!	''	say	 creation 	 ists 	 	.
``	So	you	admit	it	's	all	interpretation	.
No	one	has	ever	seen	evolution	.
We	see	rocks	.
You	have	your	interpretation	.	We	have	ours	.
 Your 	 s 	 	comes	from	 guess 	 work 	 	,	ours	from	the	Bible	.	''
But	what	 creation 	 ist 	 	and	 empiric 	 ists 	 	both	ignore	is	that	,	in	that	sense	,	no	one	has	ever	seen	a	bible	either	,	that	the	eye	only	 detect 	 s 	 	light	,	which	we	do	n't	 perceiv 	 e 	 	.
Brains	only	detect	nerve	 impulse 	 s 	 	.
And	they	do	n't	 perceiv 	 e 	 	even	those	as	what	they	 re 	 ally 	 	are	,	 name 	 ly 	 	electrical	 crackle 	 s 	 	.
So	we	 perceiv 	 e 	 	nothing	as	what	it	 re 	 ally 	 	is	.
Our	connection	to	reality	is	never	just	perception	.
It	's	always	,	as	Karl	Popper	put	it	,	 theory 	 - 	 laden 	 	.
Scientific	knowledge	is	n't	derived	from	anything	.
It	's	like	all	knowledge	.	It	's	 conject 	 ural 	 	,	 guess 	 work 	 	,	tested	by	observation	,	not	derived	from	it	.
So	,	were	 test 	 able 	 	 conjecture 	 s 	 	the	great	innovation	that	opened	the	intellectual	prison	gates	?
No	.	Contrary	to	what	's	usually	said	,	 test 	 ability 	 	is	common	,	in	myths	and	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	other	irrational	modes	of	thinking	.
Any	crank	claiming	the	sun	will	go	out	next	Tuesday	has	got	a	 test 	 able 	 	prediction	.
Consider	the	ancient	Greek	myth	 explain 	 ing 	 	seasons	.
 Hade 	 s 	 	,	God	of	the	Underworld	,	 kidnap 	 s 	 	 Persephon 	 e 	 	,	the	Goddess	of	Spring	,	and	 negotiat 	 es 	 	a	forced	marriage	contract	,	 requir 	 ing 	 	her	to	return	regularly	,	and	lets	her	go	.
And	each	year	,	she	is	 magic 	 ally 	 	 compell 	 ed 	 	to	return	.
And	her	mother	,	Demeter	,	Goddess	of	the	Earth	,	is	sad	,	and	makes	it	cold	and	barren	.
That	myth	is	 test 	 able 	 	.
If	winter	is	caused	by	Demeter	's	 sad 	 ness 	 	,	then	it	must	happen	everywhere	on	Earth	 simultaneous 	 ly 	 	.
So	if	the	ancient	 Greek 	 s 	 	had	only	known	that	Australia	is	at	its	 war 	 mest 	 	when	Demeter	is	at	her	 sad 	 dest 	 	,	they	'd	have	known	that	their	theory	is	false	.
So	what	was	wrong	with	that	myth	,	and	with	all	 pre 	 - 	 scientific 	 	thinking	,	and	what	,	then	,	made	that	 moment 	 ous 	 	difference	?
I	think	there	is	one	thing	you	have	to	care	about	.
And	that	 impli 	 es 	 	 test 	 ability 	 	,	the	scientific	method	,	the	Enlightenment	,	and	everything	.
And	here	is	the	crucial	thing	.
There	is	such	a	thing	as	a	defect	in	a	story	.
I	do	n't	just	mean	a	logical	defect	.	I	mean	a	bad	explanation	.
What	does	that	mean	?	Well	,	explanation	is	an	assertion	about	what	's	there	,	unseen	,	that	accounts	for	what	's	seen	.
Because	the	 explanator 	 y 	 	role	of	 Persephon 	 e 	 	's	marriage	contract	could	be	played	 e 	 qually 	 	well	by	 in 	 finitely 	 	many	other	ad	hoc	entities	.
Why	a	marriage	contract	and	not	any	other	reason	for	regular	annual	action	?
Here	is	one	.	 Persephon 	 e 	 	was	n't	released	.
She	 escape 	 d 	 	,	and	returns	every	spring	to	take	revenge	on	 Hade 	 s 	 	,	with	her	Spring	powers	.
She	 cool 	 s 	 	his	domain	with	Spring	air	,	venting	heat	up	to	the	surface	,	creating	summer	.
That	accounts	for	the	same	phenomena	as	the	original	myth	.
It	's	 e 	 qually 	 	 test 	 able 	 	.
Yet	what	it	 assert 	 s 	 	about	reality	is	,	in	many	ways	,	the	opposite	.
And	that	is	possible	because	the	details	of	the	original	myth	are	 un 	 related 	 	to	seasons	,	except	via	the	myth	itself	.
This	easy	variability	is	the	sign	of	a	bad	explanation	,	because	,	without	a	functional	reason	to	prefer	one	of	 count 	 less 	 	variants	,	 advocat 	 ing 	 	one	of	them	,	in	preference	to	the	others	,	is	irrational	.
So	,	for	the	essence	of	what	makes	the	difference	to	 en 	 able 	 	progress	,	seek	good	 explanation 	 s 	 	,	the	ones	that	ca	n't	be	easily	 vari 	 ed 	 	,	while	still	 explain 	 ing 	 	the	phenomena	.
Now	,	our	current	explanation	of	seasons	is	that	the	Earth	's	axis	is	tilted	like	that	,	so	each	 hemi 	 sphere 	 	 tilt 	 s 	 	toward	the	sun	for	half	the	year	,	and	away	for	the	other	half	.
Better	put	that	up	.
That	's	a	good	explanation	:	hard	to	vary	,	because	every	detail	plays	a	functional	role	.
For	instance	,	we	know	,	 independent 	 ly 	 	of	seasons	,	that	surfaces	tilted	away	from	radiant	heat	are	heated	less	,	and	that	a	spinning	sphere	,	in	space	,	points	in	a	constant	direction	.
And	the	tilt	also	 explain 	 s 	 	the	sun	's	angle	of	elevation	at	different	times	of	year	,	and	 predict 	 s 	 	that	the	seasons	will	be	out	of	phase	in	the	two	 hemi 	 spheres 	 	.
If	they	'd	been	observed	in	phase	,	the	theory	would	have	been	 refut 	 ed 	 	.
But	now	,	the	fact	that	it	's	also	a	good	explanation	,	hard	to	vary	,	makes	the	crucial	difference	.
If	the	ancient	 Greek 	 s 	 	had	found	out	about	seasons	in	Australia	,	they	could	have	easily	 vari 	 ed 	 	their	myth	to	predict	that	.
For	instance	,	when	Demeter	is	upset	,	she	 banish 	 es 	 	heat	from	her	vicinity	,	into	the	other	 hemi 	 sphere 	 	,	where	it	makes	summer	.
So	,	being	proved	wrong	by	observation	,	and	changing	their	theory	 according 	 ly 	 	,	still	would	n't	have	got	the	ancient	 Greek 	 s 	 	one	jot	closer	to	understanding	seasons	,	because	their	explanation	was	bad	:	easy	to	vary	.
And	it	's	only	when	an	explanation	is	good	that	it	even	matters	whether	it	's	 test 	 able 	 	.
If	the	 axis 	 - 	 tilt 	 	theory	had	been	 refut 	 ed 	 	,	its	 defender 	 s 	 	would	have	had	nowhere	to	go	.
No	easily	implemented	change	could	make	that	tilt	cause	the	same	seasons	in	both	 hemi 	 spheres 	 	.
The	search	for	 hard 	 - 	 to 	 - 	 vary 	 	 explanation 	 s 	 	is	the	origin	of	all	progress	.
It	's	the	basic	regulating	principle	of	the	Enlightenment	.
So	,	in	science	,	two	false	approaches	blight	progress	.
One	is	well	known	:	 unte 	 stable 	 	theories	.
But	the	more	important	one	is	 explanation 	 less 	 	theories	.
Whenever	you	're	told	that	some	existing	statistical	trend	will	continue	,	but	you	are	n't	given	a	 hard 	 - 	 to 	 - 	 vary 	 	account	of	what	causes	that	trend	,	you	're	being	told	a	wizard	did	it	.
When	you	are	told	that	 carrot 	 s 	 	have	human	rights	because	they	share	half	our	genes	--	but	not	how	gene	 percentage 	 s 	 	confer	rights	--	wizard	.
When	someone	 announce 	 s 	 	that	the	 nature 	 - 	 nurtur 	 e 	 	debate	has	been	settled	because	there	is	evidence	that	a	given	percentage	of	our	political	opinions	are	genetically	 inherit 	 ed 	 	,	but	they	do	n't	explain	how	genes	cause	opinions	,	they	've	settled	nothing	.	They	are	saying	that	our	opinions	are	caused	by	wizards	,	and	 presum 	 ably 	 	so	are	their	own	.
That	the	truth	 consist 	 s 	 	of	hard	to	vary	 assertion 	 s 	 	about	reality	is	the	most	important	fact	about	the	physical	world	.
It	's	a	fact	that	is	,	itself	,	unseen	,	yet	impossible	to	vary	.	Thank	you	.

Yves	 Ross 	 y 	 	:	Fly	with	the	 Jet 	 man 	 
Text	:	 Jet 	 man 	 	-	Yves	 Ross 	 y 	 	Grand	Canyon	Narrator	:	Many	of	the	tests	are	conducted	while	Yves	is	 s 	 trapped 	 	onto	the	wing	,	because	Yves	'	body	is	an	integral	part	of	the	aircraft	.
Text	:	Wind	tunnel	tests	Narrator	:	The	wing	has	no	steering	controls	,	no	flaps	,	no	rudder	.
Yves	uses	his	body	to	steer	the	wing	.
Stefan	von	Bergen	:	Well	he	turns	by	just	putting	his	head	on	one	or	the	other	side	.
And	sometimes	he	assists	that	with	his	hands	,	sometimes	even	with	the	leg	.
He	's	acting	as	a	human	fuselage	,	so	to	say	.
And	that	's	quite	unique	.
Narrator	:	When	he	arches	his	back	,	he	 gain 	 s 	 	altitude	.
When	he	 push 	 es 	 	his	 shoulder 	 s 	 	forward	,	he	goes	into	a	dive	.
Text	:	Swiss	Alps	Strait	of	Gibraltar	crossing	English	Channel	crossing	Commentator	:	There	he	goes	.
There	is	Yves	 Ross 	 y 	 	.
And	I	think	the	wing	is	open	,	the	wing	is	open	.
So	our	first	critical	moment	,	it	's	open	.
He	is	down	.	Is	he	flying	?
Commentator	Two	:	It	looks	like	he	's	stabilized	.
He	's	starting	to	make	his	climb	.
Commentator	:	There	's	that	90	degree	turn	you	're	talking	about	,	taking	him	out	.
He	's	out	over	the	channel	.
There	is	Yves	 Ross 	 y 	 	.
There	is	no	turning	back	now	.
He	is	over	the	English	Channel	and	 under 	 way 	 	.
Ladies	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	,	an	historic	flight	has	begun	.
Commentator	Two	:	And	what	he	's	going	to	do	as	he	approaches	the	ground	is	pull	down	on	those	 toggle 	 s 	 	to	flare	,	slow	himself	down	just	a	little	bit	,	and	then	come	in	for	a	nice	landing	.
Commentator	:	There	he	is	.
Yves	 Ross 	 y 	 	has	 land 	 ed 	 	in	England	.
Bruno	 Gius 	 sani 	 	:	And	now	he	's	in	Edinburgh	.	Yves	 Ross 	 y 	 	.
And	his	equipment	as	well	.
Yves	,	welcome	.	It	is	quite	amazing	.
Those	sequences	were	shot	over	the	last	three	years	in	various	 moment 	 s 	 	of	your	activities	.
And	there	were	many	,	many	others	.
So	it	's	possible	to	fly	almost	like	a	bird	.
What	is	it	[	like	]	to	be	up	there	?
Yves	 Ross 	 y 	 	:	It	's	fun	.	It	's	fun	.
I	do	n't	have	feathers	.
But	I	feel	like	a	bird	sometimes	.
It	's	 re 	 ally 	 	an	unreal	feeling	,	because	 normal 	 ly 	 	you	have	a	big	thing	,	a	plane	,	around	you	.
And	when	I	strap	just	these	little	 harness 	 es 	 	,	this	little	wing	,	I	 re 	 ally 	 	have	the	feeling	of	being	a	bird	.
BG	:	How	did	you	start	to	become	 Jet 	 man 	 	?
YR	:	It	was	about	20	years	ago	when	I	discovered	free	 fall 	 ing 	 	.
When	you	go	out	of	an	airplane	you	are	almost	naked	.
You	take	a	position	like	that	.
And	especially	when	you	take	a	tracking	position	,	you	have	the	feeling	that	you	are	flying	.
And	that	's	the	 near 	 est 	 	thing	to	the	dream	.
You	have	no	machine	around	you	.
You	are	just	in	the	element	.
It	's	very	short	and	only	in	one	direction	.
So	the	idea	was	,	okay	,	keep	that	feeling	of	freedom	,	but	change	the	vector	and	increase	the	time	.
BG	:	So	I	'm	kind	of	curious	,	what	's	your	top	speed	?
YR	:	It	's	about	300	km	per	hour	before	 loop 	 ing 	 	.
That	means	about	190	miles	per	hour	.
BG	:	And	what	's	the	weight	of	the	equipment	you	're	carrying	?
YR	:	When	I	exit	full	of	 ke 	 rosene 	 	,	I	'm	about	55	 kilo 	 s 	 	.
I	have	55	 kilo 	 s 	 	on	my	back	.
BG	:	And	you	're	not	 pilot 	 ing 	 	?
There	is	no	handle	,	no	steering	nothing	?
It	is	 pur 	 ely 	 	your	body	,	and	the	wings	become	part	of	the	body	and	vice	versa	?
YR	:	That	's	 re 	 ally 	 	the	goal	,	because	if	you	put	[	in	]	steering	,	then	you	 re 	 invent 	 	the	airplane	.
And	I	wanted	to	keep	this	freedom	of	movement	.
And	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	like	the	kid	playing	the	airplane	.
I	want	to	go	down	like	that	.
And	up	I	climb	,	I	turn	.
It	's	 re 	 ally 	 	pure	flying	.
It	's	not	steering	,	it	's	flight	.
BG	:	What	kind	of	training	do	you	do	,	you	 personal 	 ly 	 	,	for	that	?
YR	:	Actually	,	I	try	to	stay	just	fit	.
I	do	n't	do	special	physical	training	.
Just	,	I	try	to	keep	my	mobility	through	new	activities	.
For	example	,	last	winter	I	began	with	kite	surfing	--	so	new	things	.
So	you	have	to	adapt	.
Because	this	is	--	I	'm	quite	an	 experience 	 d 	 	manager	of	systems	as	a	pilot	,	but	this	is	 re 	 ally 	 	--	you	need	 fluid 	 ity 	 	,	you	need	to	be	agile	and	also	to	adapt	 re 	 ally 	 	fast	.
BG	:	 Some 	 body 	 	in	the	audience	asked	me	,	``	How	does	he	breathe	up	there	?	''
because	you	're	going	fast	and	you	're	up	3,000	meters	or	so	.
YR	:	Okay	,	up	to	3,000	meters	,	it	's	not	such	a	big	problem	with	oxygen	.
But	for	example	,	bikers	,	they	have	the	same	speed	.
Just	with	the	helmet	,	integral	helmet	,	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	no	problem	to	breathe	.
BG	:	Describe	for	me	the	equipment	since	you	have	it	here	.
So	 Breit 	 ling 	 	's	four	engines	.
YR	:	Yeah	,	 two 	 - 	 meter 	 	span	.
 Ultra 	 stable 	 	profile	.
Four	little	engines	,	22	 kilo 	 s 	 	thrust	each	,	turbines	working	with	 ke 	 rosene 	 	.
Harness	,	parachute	.
My	only	instruments	are	[	an	]	 alti 	 meter 	 	and	time	.
I	know	I	have	about	eight	minutes	fuel	.
So	just	check	before	it	's	finished	.
And	yeah	,	that	's	all	.
Two	 parachute 	 s 	 	.
That	means	,	if	I	have	a	problem	with	the	first	one	I	pull	,	I	still	have	the	possibility	to	open	the	second	one	.
And	this	is	my	life	.
That	's	the	real	important	thing	about	safety	.
I	did	use	that	during	these	last	15	years	about	20	times	--	never	with	that	type	of	wing	,	but	at	the	beginning	.
I	can	release	my	wing	when	I	am	in	a	spin	or	 un 	 stable 	 	.
BG	:	We	saw	the	2009	crossing	of	the	Gibraltar	Strait	where	you	lost	control	and	then	you	dived	down	into	the	clouds	and	in	the	ocean	.
So	that	was	one	of	those	cases	where	you	let	the	wings	go	,	right	?
YR	:	Yeah	.	I	did	try	in	[	the	]	clouds	,	but	you	lose	[	orientation	 complete 	 ly 	 	]	.
So	I	did	try	to	take	,	again	,	a	climb	altitude	.
I	thought	,	okay	,	I	will	go	out	.
But	most	probably	I	did	something	like	that	.
BG	:	Something	that	is	not	very	safe	in	image	.
YR	:	But	you	feel	great	,	but	you	have	not	the	right	altitude	.
So	the	next	thing	I	saw	was	just	blue	.
It	was	the	sea	.
I	have	also	an	audible	 alti 	 meter 	 	.
So	I	was	at	my	minimum	altitude	in	that	vector	--	fast	--	so	I	 pull 	 ed 	 	that	.
And	then	I	did	open	my	chute	.
BG	:	So	the	wings	have	their	own	parachute	,	and	you	have	your	two	 parachute 	 s 	 	.
YR	:	Exactly	.	There	is	a	rescue	parachute	for	the	wing	for	two	reasons	:	so	I	can	repair	it	afterward	and	especially	so	nobody	takes	that	,	just	on	his	head	.
BG	:	I	see	.	Maybe	come	back	here	.
This	is	 ri 	 sky 	 	stuff	 inde 	 ed 	 	.
People	have	died	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	this	kind	of	thing	.
And	you	do	n't	look	like	a	crazy	guy	;	you	're	a	Swiss	 air 	 line 	 	pilot	,	so	you	're	rather	a	 check 	 list 	 	kind	of	guy	.
I	assume	you	have	standards	.
YR	:	Yeah	.	I	have	no	 check 	 list 	 	for	that	.
BG	:	Let	's	not	tell	you	employer	.
YR	:	No	,	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	two	worlds	.
Civil	aviation	is	something	that	we	know	very	well	.
We	have	a	hundred	years	of	experience	.
And	you	can	adapt	 re 	 ally 	 	 precise 	 ly 	 	.
With	that	,	I	have	to	adapt	to	something	new	.
That	means	improvise	.
So	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	a	play	between	these	two	approaches	.
Something	that	I	know	very	well	--	these	principles	,	for	example	,	we	have	two	engines	on	an	 Air 	 bus 	 	;	with	only	one	engine	,	you	can	fly	it	.
So	plan	B	,	always	a	plan	B	.
In	a	fighter	,	you	have	an	ejection	seat	.
That	's	my	ejection	seat	.
So	I	have	the	approach	of	a	professional	pilot	with	the	respect	of	a	pioneer	in	front	of	Mother	Nature	.
BG	:	It	's	well	said	.	It	's	well	said	.
What	 happen 	 s 	 	if	one	of	the	engines	stops	?
YR	:	I	do	a	roll	.
And	then	I	stabilize	,	and	according	to	my	altitude	,	I	continue	on	two	or	three	engines	.
It	's	sometimes	possible	--	it	's	quite	complicated	to	explain	--	but	according	to	which	regime	I	was	,	I	can	continue	on	two	and	try	to	get	a	nice	place	to	land	,	and	then	I	open	my	parachute	.
BG	:	So	the	beginning	of	the	flight	is	actually	you	jump	off	a	plane	or	a	helicopter	,	and	you	go	on	a	dive	and	accelerate	the	engines	,	and	then	you	 bas 	 ically 	 	take	off	 mid 	 - 	 air 	 	 s 	 omewhere 	 	.
And	then	the	landing	,	as	we	have	seen	,	 arriv 	 ing 	 	on	this	side	of	the	channel	,	is	through	a	parachute	.
So	just	as	a	curiosity	,	where	did	you	land	when	you	flew	over	the	Grand	Canyon	?
Did	you	land	on	the	rim	,	down	at	the	bottom	?
YR	:	It	was	down	on	the	bottom	.
And	I	came	back	afterward	on	the	sled	of	the	helicopter	back	.
But	it	was	too	 stone 	 y 	 	and	full	of	cactus	on	top	.
BG	:	That	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	why	I	asked	the	question	.
YR	:	And	also	the	currents	are	quite	funny	there	.
There	is	big	thermal	activity	,	big	difference	in	altitude	also	.
So	it	was	much	 sa 	 fer 	 	for	me	to	land	at	the	bottom	.
BG	:	So	I	think	that	right	now	,	many	people	in	the	audience	are	 as 	 king 	 	,	``	Okay	,	when	are	you	developing	a	 double 	 - 	 s 	 eater 	 	so	they	can	fly	with	you	?	''
YR	:	I	have	a	standard	answer	.
Have	you	ever	seen	tandem	birds	?
BG	:	Perfect	answer	.
Yves	,	one	last	question	.
What	's	next	for	you	?	What	's	next	for	 Jet 	 man 	 	?
YR	:	First	,	to	instruct	a	younger	guy	.
I	want	to	share	it	,	to	do	formation	flights	.
And	I	plan	to	start	from	a	cliff	,	like	 catapult 	 ed 	 	from	a	cliff	.
BG	:	So	instead	of	jumping	off	a	plane	,	yes	?
YR	:	Yes	,	with	the	final	goal	to	take	off	,	but	with	initial	speed	.
 Re 	 ally 	 	,	I	go	step	by	step	.
It	 seem 	 s 	 	a	little	bit	crazy	,	but	it	's	not	.
It	's	possible	to	start	already	now	,	it	's	just	too	dangerous	.
Thanks	to	the	increasing	technology	,	better	technology	,	it	will	be	safe	.
And	I	hope	it	will	be	for	everybody	.
BG	:	Yves	,	thank	you	very	much	.	Yves	 Ross 	 y 	 	.

Josh	Silver	demos	 adjust 	 able 	 	 liquid 	 - 	 filled 	 	 eye 	 glasses 	 
I	'm	going	to	tell	you	about	one	of	the	world	's	largest	problems	and	how	it	can	be	solved	.
I	'd	like	to	start	with	a	little	experiment	.
Could	you	put	your	hand	up	if	you	wear	glasses	or	contact	lenses	,	or	you	've	had	laser	refractive	surgery	?
Now	,	 unfortunat 	 ely 	 	,	there	are	too	many	of	you	for	me	to	do	the	statistics	properly	.
But	it	looks	like	--	I	'm	 guess 	 ing 	 	--	that	it	'll	be	about	60	percent	of	the	room	because	that	's	 rough 	 ly 	 	the	fraction	of	developed	world	population	that	have	some	sort	of	vision	correction	.
The	World	Health	Organization	estimates	--	well	,	they	make	various	estimates	of	the	number	of	people	who	need	glasses	--	the	 lo 	 west 	 	estimate	is	150	million	people	.
They	also	have	an	estimate	of	around	a	billion	.
But	in	fact	,	I	would	argue	that	we	've	just	done	an	experiment	here	and	now	,	which	shows	us	that	the	global	need	for	 correct 	 ive 	 	 eye 	 wear 	 	is	around	half	of	any	population	.
And	the	problem	of	poor	vision	,	is	actually	not	just	a	health	problem	,	it	's	also	an	educational	problem	,	and	it	's	an	economic	problem	,	and	it	's	a	quality	of	life	problem	.
Glasses	are	not	very	expensive	.	They	're	quite	plentiful	.
The	problem	is	,	there	are	n't	enough	eye	care	professionals	in	the	world	to	use	the	model	of	the	delivery	of	 correct 	 ive 	 	 eye 	 wear 	 	that	we	have	in	the	developed	world	.
There	are	just	way	too	few	eye	care	professionals	.
So	this	little	slide	here	shows	you	an	 opto 	 metrist 	 	and	the	little	blue	person	 represent 	 s 	 	about	10,000	people	and	that	's	the	ratio	in	the	U.K	.
This	is	the	ratio	of	 opto 	 metrists 	 	to	people	in	 sub 	 - 	 Saharan 	 	Africa	.
In	fact	,	there	are	some	countries	in	 sub 	 - 	 Saharan 	 	Africa	where	there	's	one	 opto 	 metrist 	 	for	eight	million	of	the	population	.
How	do	you	do	this	?	How	do	you	solve	this	problem	?
I	came	up	with	a	solution	to	this	problem	,	and	I	came	up	with	a	solution	based	on	adaptive	optics	for	this	.
And	the	idea	is	you	make	eye	glasses	,	and	you	adjust	them	yourself	and	that	 solve 	 s 	 	the	problem	.
What	I	want	to	do	is	to	show	you	that	one	can	make	a	pair	of	glasses	.
I	shall	just	show	you	how	you	make	a	pair	of	glasses	.	I	shall	pop	this	in	my	pocket	.
I	'm	short	sighted	.	I	look	at	the	signs	at	the	end	,	I	can	 hard 	 ly 	 	see	them	.
So	--	okay	,	I	can	now	see	that	man	running	out	there	,	and	I	can	see	that	guy	running	out	there	.
I	've	now	made	prescription	 eye 	 wear 	 	to	my	prescription	.
Next	step	in	my	process	.
So	,	I	've	now	made	eye	glasses	to	my	prescription	.
Okay	,	so	I	've	made	these	glasses	and	...
Okay	,	I	've	made	the	glasses	to	my	prescription	and	...
...	I	've	just	...
And	I	've	now	made	some	glasses	.	That	's	it	.
Now	,	these	are	n't	the	only	pair	in	the	world	.
In	fact	,	this	technology	's	been	evolving	.
I	started	working	on	it	in	1985	,	and	it	's	been	evolving	very	 slow 	 ly 	 	.
There	are	about	30,000	in	use	now	.
And	they	're	in	fifteen	countries	.	They	're	spread	around	the	world	.
And	I	have	a	vision	,	which	I	'll	share	with	you	.
I	have	a	global	vision	for	vision	.
And	that	vision	is	to	try	to	get	a	billion	people	wearing	the	glasses	they	need	by	the	year	2020	.
To	do	that	--	this	is	an	early	example	of	the	technology	.
The	technology	is	being	further	developed	--	the	cost	has	to	be	brought	down	.
This	pair	,	in	fact	,	these	currently	cost	about	19	dollars	.
But	the	cost	has	to	be	brought	right	down	.
It	has	to	be	brought	down	because	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	serve	 population 	 s 	 	who	live	on	a	dollar	a	day	.
How	do	you	solve	this	problem	?
You	start	to	get	into	detail	.
And	on	this	slide	,	I	'm	 bas 	 ically 	 	 explain 	 ing 	 	all	the	problems	you	have	.
How	do	you	distribute	?	How	do	you	work	out	how	to	fit	the	thing	?
How	do	you	have	people	 realiz 	 ing 	 	that	they	have	a	vision	problem	?
How	do	you	deal	with	the	industry	?
And	the	answer	to	that	is	research	.
What	we	've	done	is	to	set	up	the	Center	for	Vision	in	the	Developing	World	here	in	the	university	.
If	you	want	to	know	more	,	just	come	have	a	look	at	our	website	.	Thank	you	.

Plants	behave	in	some	 odd 	 ly 	 	intelligent	ways	:	fighting	 predator 	 s 	 	,	 maximiz 	 ing 	 	food	opportunities	...	But	can	we	think	of	them	as	actually	having	a	form	of	intelligence	of	their	own	?	Italian	botanist	Stefano	 Man 	 cuso 	 	 present 	 s 	 	 i 	 ntriguing 	 	evidence	.

Stefano	 Man 	 cuso 	 	:	The	roots	of	plant	intelligence
Sometimes	I	go	browsing	[	through	]	a	very	old	magazine	.
I	found	this	observation	test	about	the	story	of	the	ark	.
And	the	artist	that	drew	this	observation	test	did	some	errors	,	had	some	 mistake 	 s 	 	--	there	are	more	or	less	12	 mistake 	 s 	 	.
Some	of	them	are	very	easy	.
There	is	a	funnel	,	an	aerial	part	,	a	lamp	and	 clock 	 work 	 	key	on	the	ark	.
Some	of	them	are	about	the	animals	,	the	number	.
But	there	is	a	much	more	fundamental	mistake	in	the	overall	story	of	the	ark	that	's	not	reported	here	.
And	this	problem	is	:	where	are	the	plants	?
So	now	we	have	God	that	is	going	to	 sub 	 merge 	 	Earth	 permanent 	 ly 	 	or	at	least	for	a	very	long	period	,	and	no	one	is	taking	care	of	plants	.
Noah	needed	to	take	two	of	every	kind	of	bird	,	of	every	kind	of	animal	,	of	every	kind	of	creature	that	moves	,	but	no	mention	about	plants	.
Why	?
In	another	part	of	the	same	story	,	all	the	living	creatures	are	just	the	living	creatures	that	came	out	from	the	ark	,	so	birds	,	livestock	and	wild	animals	.
Plants	are	not	living	creatures	--	this	is	the	point	.
That	is	a	point	that	is	not	coming	out	from	the	Bible	,	but	it	's	something	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 a 	 ccompanied 	 	humanity	.
Let	's	have	a	look	at	this	nice	code	that	is	coming	from	a	Renaissance	book	.
Here	we	have	the	description	of	the	order	of	nature	.
It	's	a	nice	description	because	it	's	starting	from	left	--	you	have	the	stones	--	 immediate 	 ly 	 	after	the	stones	,	the	plants	that	are	just	able	to	live	.
We	have	the	animals	that	are	able	to	live	and	to	sense	,	and	on	the	top	of	the	pyramid	,	there	is	the	man	.
This	is	not	the	common	man	.
The	``	Homo	 studios 	 us 	 	''	--	the	 study 	 ing 	 	man	.
This	is	quite	 comfort 	 ing 	 	for	people	like	me	--	I	'm	a	professor	--	this	to	be	over	there	on	the	top	of	creation	.
But	it	's	something	 complete 	 ly 	 	wrong	.
You	know	very	well	about	 professor 	 s 	 	.
But	it	's	also	wrong	about	plants	,	because	plants	are	not	just	able	to	live	;	they	are	able	to	sense	.
They	are	much	more	 s 	 ophisticated 	 	in	sensing	than	animals	.
Just	to	give	you	an	example	,	every	single	root	apex	is	able	to	detect	and	to	monitor	 concurrent 	 ly 	 	and	 continuous 	 ly 	 	at	least	15	different	chemical	and	physical	parameters	.
And	they	also	are	able	to	show	and	to	exhibit	such	a	wonderful	and	complex	behavior	that	can	be	described	just	with	the	term	of	intelligence	.
Well	,	but	this	is	something	--	this	 under 	 estimation 	 	of	plants	is	something	that	is	always	with	us	.
Let	's	have	a	look	at	this	short	movie	now	.
We	have	David	 Atten 	 borough 	 	.
Now	David	 Atten 	 borough 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	a	plant	lover	;	he	did	some	of	the	most	beautiful	movies	about	plant	behavior	.
Now	,	when	he	 speak 	 s 	 	about	plants	,	everything	is	correct	.
When	he	 speak 	 s 	 	about	animals	,	[	he	]	 tend 	 s 	 	to	remove	the	fact	that	plants	exist	.
The	blue	whale	,	the	biggest	creature	that	exists	on	the	planet	--	that	is	wrong	,	 complete 	 ly 	 	wrong	.
The	blue	whale	,	it	's	a	dwarf	if	compared	with	the	real	biggest	creature	that	exists	on	the	planet	--	that	is	,	this	wonderful	,	magnificent	 Sequoia 	 dendron 	 	 gigante 	 um 	 	.
And	this	is	a	living	organism	that	has	a	mass	of	at	least	2,000	tons	.
Now	,	the	story	that	plants	are	some	 low 	 - 	 level 	 	organisms	has	been	 formaliz 	 ed 	 	many	times	ago	by	Aristotle	,	that	in	``	De	Anima	''	--	that	is	a	very	 i 	 nfluential 	 	book	for	the	Western	civilization	--	wrote	that	the	plants	are	on	the	edge	between	living	and	not	living	.
They	have	just	a	kind	of	very	 low 	 - 	 level 	 	soul	.
It	's	called	the	vegetative	soul	,	because	they	lack	movement	,	and	so	they	do	n't	need	to	sense	.
Let	's	see	.
Okay	,	some	of	the	movements	of	the	plants	are	very	 well 	 - 	 known 	 	.
This	is	a	very	fast	movement	.
This	is	a	 Diona 	 ea 	 	,	a	Venus	fly	trap	hunting	snails	--	sorry	for	the	snail	.
This	has	been	something	that	has	been	 refus 	 ed 	 	for	centuries	,	 despit 	 e 	 	the	evidence	.
No	one	can	say	that	the	plants	were	able	to	eat	an	animal	,	because	it	was	against	the	order	of	nature	.
But	plants	are	also	able	to	show	a	lot	of	movement	.
Some	of	them	are	very	well	known	,	like	the	flowering	.
It	's	just	a	question	to	use	some	techniques	like	the	time	lapse	.
Some	of	them	are	much	more	 s 	 ophisticated 	 	.
Look	at	this	young	bean	that	is	moving	to	catch	the	light	every	time	.
And	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	so	graceful	;	it	's	like	a	dancing	angel	.
They	are	also	able	to	play	--	they	are	 re 	 ally 	 	playing	.
These	are	young	 sun 	 flowers 	 	,	and	what	they	are	 do 	 ing 	 	can	not	be	described	with	any	other	terms	than	playing	.
They	are	training	themselves	,	as	many	young	animals	do	,	to	the	adult	life	where	they	will	be	called	to	track	the	sun	all	the	day	.
They	are	able	to	respond	to	gravity	,	of	course	,	so	the	shoots	are	growing	against	the	vector	of	gravity	and	the	roots	toward	the	vector	of	gravity	.
But	they	are	also	able	to	sleep	.
This	is	one	,	Mimosa	pudica	.
So	during	the	night	,	they	curl	the	leaves	and	reduce	the	movement	,	and	during	the	day	,	you	have	the	opening	of	the	leaves	--	there	is	much	more	movement	.
This	is	 interest 	 ing 	 	because	this	sleeping	machinery	,	it	's	 perfect 	 ly 	 	 conserv 	 ed 	 	.
It	's	the	same	in	plants	,	in	 insect 	 s 	 	and	in	animals	.
And	so	if	you	need	to	study	this	sleeping	problem	,	it	's	easy	to	study	on	plants	,	for	example	,	than	in	animals	and	it	's	much	more	easy	even	ethically	.
It	's	a	kind	of	vegetarian	 experiment 	 ation 	 	.
Plants	are	even	able	to	communicate	--	they	are	 extraordinar 	 y 	 	 communicator 	 s 	 	.
They	communicate	with	other	plants	.
They	are	able	to	distinguish	kin	and	 non 	 - 	 kin 	 	.
They	communicate	with	plants	of	other	species	and	they	communicate	with	animals	by	producing	chemical	 volatile 	 s 	 	,	for	example	,	during	the	 pollinat 	 ion 	 	.
Now	with	the	 pollinat 	 ion 	 	,	it	's	a	very	serious	issue	for	plants	,	because	they	move	the	pollen	from	one	flower	to	the	other	,	yet	they	can	not	move	from	one	flower	to	the	other	.
So	they	need	a	vector	--	and	this	vector	,	it	's	 normal 	 ly 	 	an	animal	.
Many	 insect 	 s 	 	have	been	used	by	plants	as	vectors	for	the	transport	of	the	 pollinat 	 ion 	 	,	but	not	just	 insect 	 s 	 	;	even	birds	,	 reptile 	 s 	 	,	and	mammals	like	bats	rats	are	 normal 	 ly 	 	used	for	the	transportation	of	the	pollen	.
This	is	a	serious	business	.
We	have	the	plants	that	are	giving	to	the	animals	a	kind	of	sweet	substance	--	very	 energ 	 izing 	 	--	having	in	change	this	transportation	of	the	pollen	.
But	some	plants	are	 manipulat 	 ing 	 	animals	,	like	in	the	case	of	 orchid 	 s 	 	that	promise	sex	and	nectar	and	give	in	change	nothing	for	the	transportation	of	the	pollen	.
Now	,	there	is	a	big	problem	behind	all	this	behavior	that	we	have	seen	.
How	is	it	possible	to	do	this	without	a	brain	?
We	need	to	wait	until	1880	,	when	this	big	man	,	Charles	Darwin	,	 publish 	 es 	 	a	wonderful	,	 astonish 	 ing 	 	book	that	starts	a	revolution	.
The	title	is	``	The	Power	of	Movement	in	Plants	.	''
No	one	was	allowed	to	speak	about	movement	in	plants	before	Charles	Darwin	.
In	his	book	,	assisted	by	his	son	,	Francis	--	who	was	the	first	professor	of	plant	physiology	in	the	world	,	in	Cambridge	--	they	took	into	consideration	every	single	movement	for	500	pages	.
And	in	the	last	paragraph	of	the	book	,	it	's	a	kind	of	stylistic	mark	,	because	 normal 	 ly 	 	Charles	Darwin	 store 	 d 	 	,	in	the	last	paragraph	of	a	book	,	the	most	important	message	.
He	wrote	that	,	``	It	's	 hard 	 ly 	 	an	 exaggerat 	 ion 	 	to	say	that	the	tip	of	the	radical	acts	like	the	brain	of	one	of	the	lower	animals	.	''
This	is	not	a	metaphor	.
He	wrote	some	very	 interest 	 ing 	 	letters	to	one	of	his	friends	who	was	J.D	.	Hooker	,	or	at	that	time	,	president	of	the	Royal	Society	,	so	the	maximum	scientific	authority	in	Britain	speaking	about	the	brain	in	the	plants	.
Now	,	this	is	a	root	apex	growing	against	a	slope	.
So	you	can	 recogniz 	 e 	 	this	kind	of	movement	,	the	same	movement	that	worms	,	snakes	and	every	animal	that	are	moving	on	the	ground	without	legs	is	able	to	display	.
And	it	's	not	an	easy	movement	because	,	to	have	this	kind	of	movement	,	you	need	to	move	different	regions	of	the	root	and	to	synchronize	these	different	regions	without	having	a	brain	.
So	we	studied	the	root	apex	and	we	found	that	there	is	a	specific	region	that	is	here	,	depicted	in	blue	--	that	is	called	the	``	transition	zone	.	''
And	this	region	,	it	's	a	very	small	region	--	it	's	less	than	one	millimeter	.
And	in	this	small	region	you	have	the	highest	consumption	of	oxygen	in	the	plants	and	more	important	,	you	have	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	signals	here	.
The	signals	that	you	are	seeing	here	are	action	potential	,	are	the	same	signals	that	the	neurons	of	my	brain	,	of	our	brain	,	use	to	exchange	information	.
Now	we	know	that	a	root	apex	has	just	a	few	hundred	cells	that	show	this	kind	of	feature	,	but	we	know	how	big	the	root	apparatus	of	a	small	plant	,	like	a	plant	of	rye	.
We	have	almost	14	million	roots	.
We	have	11	and	a	half	million	root	apex	and	a	total	length	of	600	or	more	kilometers	and	a	very	high	surface	area	.
Now	let	's	imagine	that	each	single	root	apex	is	working	in	network	with	all	the	others	.
Here	were	have	on	the	left	,	the	Internet	and	on	the	right	,	the	root	apparatus	.
They	work	in	the	same	way	.
They	are	a	network	of	small	computing	machines	,	working	in	networks	.
And	why	are	they	so	similar	?
Because	they	evolved	for	the	same	reason	:	to	survive	predation	.
They	work	in	the	same	way	.
So	you	can	remove	90	percent	of	the	root	apparatus	and	the	plants	[	continue	]	to	work	.
You	can	remove	90	percent	of	the	Internet	and	it	is	[	 continu 	 ing 	 	]	to	work	.
So	,	a	suggestion	for	the	people	working	with	networks	:	plants	are	able	to	give	you	good	 suggestion 	 s 	 	about	how	to	evolve	networks	.
And	another	possibility	is	a	technological	possibility	.
Let	's	imagine	that	we	can	build	robots	and	robots	that	are	inspired	by	plants	.
Until	now	,	the	man	was	inspired	just	by	man	or	the	animals	in	producing	a	robot	.
We	have	the	 animal 	 oid 	 	--	and	the	normal	robots	inspired	by	animals	,	 insect 	 oid 	 	,	so	on	.
We	have	the	 android 	 s 	 	that	are	inspired	by	man	.
But	why	have	we	not	any	 plant 	 oid 	 	?
Well	,	if	you	want	to	fly	,	it	's	good	that	you	look	at	birds	--	to	be	inspired	by	birds	.
But	if	you	want	to	explore	soils	,	or	if	you	want	to	colonize	new	territory	,	to	best	thing	that	you	can	do	is	to	be	inspired	by	plants	that	are	masters	in	 do 	 ing 	 	this	.
We	have	another	possibility	we	are	working	[	on	]	in	our	lab	,	[	which	]	is	to	build	 hybrid 	 s 	 	.
It	's	much	more	easy	to	build	 hybrid 	 s 	 	.
Hybrid	means	it	's	something	that	's	half	living	and	half	machine	.
It	's	much	more	easy	to	work	with	plants	than	with	animals	.
They	have	computing	power	,	they	have	electrical	signals	.
The	connection	with	the	machine	is	much	more	easy	,	much	more	even	ethically	possible	.
And	these	are	three	 possibilit 	 ies 	 	that	we	are	working	on	to	build	 hybrid 	 s 	 	,	driven	by	algae	or	by	the	leaves	at	the	end	,	by	the	most	,	most	powerful	parts	of	the	plants	,	by	the	roots	.
Well	,	thank	you	for	your	attention	.
And	before	I	finish	,	I	would	like	to	 reassur 	 e 	 	that	no	snails	were	 har 	 med 	 	in	making	this	presentation	.
Thank	you	.

A	 whistleblow 	 er 	 	you	have	n't	heard
Thank	you	.
Thank	you	very	much	.
That	was	 whistl 	 ing 	 	.
I	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	this	in	English	.
What	is	a	 chub 	 by 	 	,	 curly 	 - 	 haired 	 	guy	from	Holland	--	why	is	he	 whistl 	 ing 	 	?
Well	actually	,	I	've	[	been	]	 whistl 	 ing 	 	since	the	age	of	four	,	about	four	.
My	dad	was	always	 whistl 	 ing 	 	around	the	house	,	and	I	just	thought	that	's	part	of	communication	in	my	family	.
So	I	 whistle 	 d 	 	along	with	him	.
And	actually	,	till	I	was	34	,	I	always	 annoy 	 ed 	 	and	 irrit 	 ated 	 	people	with	 whistl 	 ing 	 	,	because	,	to	be	honest	,	my	 whistl 	 ing 	 	is	a	kind	of	deviant	behavior	.
I	 whistle 	 d 	 	alone	.	I	 whistle 	 d 	 	in	the	classroom	.
I	 whistle 	 d 	 	on	[	my	]	bike	.	I	 whistle 	 d 	 	everywhere	.
And	I	also	 whistle 	 d 	 	at	a	Christmas	Eve	party	with	my	 family 	 - 	 in 	 - 	 law 	 	.
And	they	had	some	,	in	my	opinion	,	terrible	Christmas	music	.
And	when	I	hear	music	that	I	do	n't	like	,	I	try	to	make	it	better	.
So	``	Rudolph	the	 Red 	 - 	 Nos 	 ed 	 	Reindeer	''	--	you	know	it	?
But	it	can	also	sound	like	this	.
But	during	a	Christmas	party	--	at	dinner	actually	--	it	's	very	 annoy 	 ing 	 	.
So	my	 sister 	 - 	 in 	 - 	 law 	 	asked	me	a	few	times	,	``	Please	stop	 whistl 	 ing 	 	.	''
And	I	just	could	n't	.
And	at	one	point	--	and	I	had	some	wine	,	I	have	to	admit	that	--	at	one	point	I	said	,	``	If	there	was	a	contest	,	I	would	join	.	''
And	two	weeks	later	I	received	a	text	message	:	``	You	're	going	to	America	.	''
So	,	okay	,	I	'm	going	to	America	.
I	would	love	to	,	but	why	?
So	I	 immediate 	 ly 	 	called	her	up	,	of	course	.
She	 Google 	 d 	 	,	and	she	found	this	World	 Whist 	 ling 	 	Championship	in	America	,	of	course	.
She	did	n't	expect	me	to	go	there	.
And	I	would	have	lost	my	face	.
I	do	n't	know	if	that	's	correct	English	.
But	the	Dutch	people	here	will	understand	what	I	mean	.
I	lost	my	face	.
And	she	thought	,	``	He	will	never	go	there	.	''
But	actually	I	did	.
So	I	went	to	 Louis 	 burg 	 	,	North	Carolina	,	southeast	United	States	,	and	I	entered	the	world	of	 whistl 	 ing 	 	.
And	I	also	entered	the	world	championship	,	and	I	won	there	in	2004	.
That	was	great	fun	,	of	course	.
And	to	defend	my	title	--	like	 judo 	 kas 	 	do	and	 sports 	 men 	 	--	I	thought	,	well	let	's	go	back	in	2005	,	and	I	won	again	.
Then	I	could	n't	participate	for	a	few	years	.
And	in	2008	I	entered	again	in	Japan	,	Tokyo	,	and	I	won	again	.
So	what	happened	now	is	I	'm	standing	here	in	Rotterdam	,	in	the	beautiful	city	,	on	a	big	stage	,	and	I	'm	talking	about	 whistl 	 ing 	 	.
And	actually	I	earn	my	money	 whistl 	 ing 	 	at	the	moment	.
So	I	quit	my	day	job	as	a	nurse	.
And	I	try	to	live	my	dream	--	well	,	actually	,	it	was	never	my	dream	,	but	it	sounds	so	good	.
Okay	,	I	'm	not	the	only	one	 whistl 	 ing 	 	here	.
You	say	,	``	Huh	,	what	do	you	mean	?	''
Well	actually	,	you	are	going	to	whistle	along	.
And	then	always	the	same	thing	 happen 	 s 	 	:	people	are	watching	each	other	and	think	,	``	Oh	,	my	God	.
Why	?	Can	I	go	away	?	''
No	,	you	ca	n't	.
Actually	it	's	very	simple	.
The	track	that	I	will	whistle	is	called	``	Fête	de	la	Belle	.	''
It	's	about	80	minutes	long	.
No	,	no	,	no	.	It	's	four	minutes	long	.
And	I	want	to	first	 rehears 	 e 	 	with	you	your	 whistl 	 ing 	 	.
So	I	whistle	the	tone	.
Sorry	.	I	forgot	one	thing	.
You	whistle	the	same	tone	as	me	.
I	heard	a	wide	variety	of	tones	.
This	is	very	promising	.
This	is	very	promising	.
I	'll	ask	the	 technician 	 s 	 	to	start	the	music	.
And	if	it	's	started	,	I	just	point	where	you	whistle	along	,	and	we	will	see	what	 happen 	 s 	 	.
Oh	,	hah	.
I	'm	so	sorry	,	 technician 	 s 	 	.
I	'm	so	used	to	that	.
I	start	it	myself	.
Okay	,	here	it	is	.
Okay	.
It	's	easy	,	is	n't	it	?
Now	comes	the	solo	.	I	propose	I	do	that	myself	.

Charlie	Todd	:	The	shared	experience	of	 absurd 	 ity 	 
I	started	Improv	Everywhere	about	10	years	ago	when	I	moved	to	New	York	City	with	an	interest	in	acting	and	comedy	.
Because	I	was	new	to	the	city	,	I	did	n't	have	access	to	a	stage	,	so	I	decided	to	create	my	own	in	public	places	.
So	the	first	project	we	're	going	to	take	a	look	at	is	the	very	first	No	Pants	Subway	Ride	.
Now	this	took	place	in	January	of	2002	.
And	this	woman	is	the	star	of	the	video	.
She	does	n't	know	she	's	being	 film 	 ed 	 	.
She	's	being	 film 	 ed 	 	with	a	hidden	camera	.
This	is	on	the	6	train	in	New	York	City	.
And	this	is	the	first	stop	along	the	line	.
These	are	two	Danish	guys	who	come	out	and	sit	down	next	to	the	hidden	camera	.
And	that	's	me	right	there	in	a	brown	coat	.
It	's	about	30	degrees	outside	.
I	'm	wearing	a	hat	.	I	'm	wearing	a	scarf	.
And	the	girl	's	going	to	notice	me	right	here	.
And	as	you	'll	see	now	,	I	'm	not	wearing	pants	.
So	at	this	point	--	at	this	point	she	's	noticed	me	,	but	in	New	York	there	's	 weird 	 os 	 	on	any	given	train	car	.
One	person	's	not	that	unusual	.
She	goes	back	to	reading	her	book	,	which	is	 unfortunat 	 ely 	 	titled	``	Rape	.	''
So	she	's	noticed	the	unusual	thing	,	but	she	's	gone	back	to	her	normal	life	.
Now	in	the	 mean 	 time 	 	,	I	have	six	friends	who	are	waiting	at	the	next	six	consecutive	stops	in	their	 under 	 wear 	 	as	well	.
They	're	going	to	be	 enter 	 ing 	 	this	car	one	by	one	.
We	'll	act	as	though	we	do	n't	know	each	other	.
And	we	'll	act	as	if	it	's	just	an	 unfortunat 	 e 	 	mistake	we	've	made	,	 forget 	 ting 	 	our	pants	on	this	cold	January	day	.
So	at	this	point	,	she	 decide 	 s 	 	to	put	the	rape	book	away	.
And	she	 decide 	 s 	 	to	be	a	little	bit	more	aware	of	her	 surround 	 ings 	 	.
Now	in	the	 mean 	 time 	 	,	the	two	Danish	guys	to	the	left	of	the	camera	,	they	're	cracking	up	.
They	think	this	is	the	 funnies 	 t 	 	thing	they	've	ever	seen	before	.
And	watch	her	make	eye	contact	with	them	right	about	now	.
And	I	love	that	moment	in	this	video	,	because	before	it	became	a	shared	experience	,	it	was	something	that	was	maybe	a	little	bit	 s 	 cary 	 	,	or	something	that	was	at	least	 confus 	 ing 	 	to	her	.
And	then	once	it	became	a	shared	experience	,	it	was	funny	and	something	that	she	could	laugh	at	.
So	the	train	is	now	pulling	into	the	third	stop	along	the	6	line	.
So	the	video	wo	n't	show	everything	.
This	goes	on	for	another	four	stops	.
A	total	of	seven	guys	enter	 anonymous 	 ly 	 	in	their	 under 	 wear 	 	.
At	the	eighth	stop	,	a	girl	came	in	with	a	giant	 duff 	 el 	 	bag	and	announced	she	had	pants	for	sale	for	a	dollar	--	like	you	might	sell	batteries	or	candy	on	the	train	.
We	all	very	matter	of	 fact 	 ly 	 	bought	a	pair	of	pants	,	put	them	on	and	said	,	``	Thank	you	.	That	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	I	needed	today	,	''	and	then	 exit 	 ed 	 	without	revealing	what	had	happened	and	went	in	all	different	 direction 	 s 	 	.
Thank	you	.
So	that	's	a	still	from	the	video	there	.
And	I	love	that	girl	's	reaction	so	much	.
And	watching	that	 videotap 	 e 	 	later	that	day	inspired	me	to	keep	 do 	 ing 	 	what	I	do	.
And	 re 	 ally 	 	one	of	the	points	of	Improv	Everywhere	is	to	cause	a	scene	in	a	public	place	that	is	a	positive	experience	for	other	people	.
It	's	a	prank	,	but	it	's	a	prank	that	gives	 some 	 body 	 	a	great	story	to	tell	.
And	her	reaction	inspired	me	to	do	a	second	annual	No	Pants	Subway	Ride	.
And	we	've	continued	to	do	it	every	year	.
This	January	,	we	did	the	10th	annual	No	Pants	Subway	Ride	where	a	diverse	group	of	3,500	people	rode	the	train	in	their	 under 	 wear 	 	in	New	York	--	almost	every	single	train	line	in	the	city	.
And	also	in	50	other	cities	around	the	world	,	people	participated	.
As	I	started	taking	improv	class	at	the	Upright	Citizens	Brigade	Theater	and	meeting	other	creative	people	and	other	 performer 	 s 	 	and	 comedian 	 s 	 	,	I	started	 am 	 assing 	 	a	 mail 	 ing 	 	list	of	people	who	wanted	to	do	these	types	of	projects	.
So	I	could	do	more	 large 	 - 	 scale 	 	projects	.
Well	one	day	I	was	walking	through	Union	Square	,	and	I	saw	this	building	,	which	had	just	been	built	in	2005	.
And	there	was	a	girl	in	one	of	the	windows	and	she	was	dancing	.
And	it	was	very	peculiar	,	because	it	was	dark	out	,	but	she	was	 back 	 - 	 lit 	 	with	florescent	lighting	,	and	she	was	very	much	 on 	 stage 	 	,	and	I	could	n't	figure	out	why	she	was	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
After	about	15	seconds	,	her	friend	appeared	--	she	had	been	hiding	behind	a	display	--	and	they	 laugh 	 ed 	 	and	hugged	each	other	and	ran	away	.
So	it	 see 	 med 	 	like	maybe	she	had	been	 dar 	 ed 	 	to	do	this	.
So	I	got	inspired	by	that	.
Looking	at	the	entire	facade	--	there	were	70	total	windows	--	and	I	knew	what	I	had	to	do	.
So	this	project	is	called	Look	Up	More	.	We	had	70	actors	dress	in	black	.
This	was	 complete 	 ly 	 	 un 	 authorized 	 	.
We	did	n't	let	the	stores	know	we	were	coming	.
And	I	stood	in	the	park	giving	signals	.
The	first	signal	was	for	everybody	to	hold	up	these	 four 	 - 	 foot 	 	tall	letters	that	spelled	out	``	Look	Up	More	,	''	the	name	of	the	project	.
The	second	signal	was	for	everybody	to	do	Jumping	jacks	together	.
You	'll	see	that	start	right	here	.
And	then	we	had	dancing	.	We	had	everyone	dance	.
And	then	we	had	dance	 solo 	 s 	 	where	only	one	person	would	dance	and	everybody	would	point	to	them	.
So	then	I	gave	a	new	hand	signal	,	which	 signal 	 ed 	 	the	next	soloist	down	below	in	Forever	21	,	and	he	 dance 	 d 	 	.
There	were	several	other	activities	.
We	had	people	jumping	up	and	down	,	people	dropping	to	the	ground	.
And	I	was	standing	just	 anonymous 	 ly 	 	in	a	 sweat 	 shirt 	 	,	putting	my	hand	on	and	off	of	a	 trash 	 can 	 	to	signal	the	advancement	.
And	because	it	was	in	Union	Square	Park	,	right	by	a	subway	station	,	there	were	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	people	by	the	end	who	stopped	and	looked	up	and	 watch 	 ed 	 	what	we	were	 do 	 ing 	 	.
There	's	a	better	photo	of	it	.
So	that	particular	event	was	inspired	by	a	moment	that	I	happened	to	 s 	 tumble 	 	upon	.
The	next	project	I	want	to	show	was	given	to	me	in	an	email	from	a	stranger	.
A	high	school	kid	in	Texas	wrote	me	in	2006	and	said	,	``	You	should	get	as	many	people	as	possible	to	put	on	blue	polo	shirts	and	khaki	pants	and	go	into	a	Best	Buy	and	stand	around	.	''
So	I	wrote	this	high	school	kid	back	 immediate 	 ly 	 	,	and	I	said	,	``	Yes	,	you	are	correct	.
I	think	I	'll	try	to	do	that	this	weekend	.	Thank	you	.	''
So	here	's	the	video	.
So	again	,	this	is	2005	.
This	is	the	Best	Buy	in	New	York	City	.
We	had	about	80	people	show	up	to	participate	,	 enter 	 ing 	 	 one 	 - 	 by 	 - 	 one 	 	.
There	was	an	eight	 year 	 - 	 old 	 	girl	,	a	10	 year 	 - 	 old 	 	girl	.
There	was	also	a	65	 year 	 - 	 old 	 	man	who	participated	.
So	a	very	diverse	group	of	people	.
And	I	told	people	,	``	Do	n't	work	.	Do	n't	actually	do	work	.
But	also	,	do	n't	shop	.
Just	stand	around	and	do	n't	face	products	.	''
Now	you	can	see	the	regular	employees	by	the	ones	that	have	the	yellow	tags	on	their	shirt	.
Everybody	else	is	one	of	our	actors	.
The	lower	level	employees	thought	it	was	very	funny	.
And	in	fact	,	several	of	them	went	to	go	get	their	camera	from	the	break	room	and	took	photos	with	us	.
A	lot	of	them	made	 joke 	 s 	 	about	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	us	to	go	to	the	back	to	get	heavy	television	sets	for	customers	.
The	 manager 	 s 	 	and	the	security	guards	,	on	the	other	hand	,	did	not	find	it	 particular 	 ly 	 	funny	.
You	can	see	them	in	this	footage	.
They	're	wearing	either	a	yellow	shirt	or	a	black	shirt	.
And	we	were	there	probably	10	minutes	before	the	 manager 	 s 	 	decided	to	dial	911	.
So	they	started	running	around	telling	everybody	the	cops	were	coming	,	watch	out	,	the	cops	were	coming	.
And	you	can	see	the	cops	in	this	footage	right	here	.
That	's	a	cop	wearing	black	right	there	,	being	 film 	 ed 	 	with	a	hidden	camera	.
Ultimately	,	the	police	had	to	inform	Best	Buy	management	that	it	was	not	,	in	fact	,	illegal	to	wear	a	blue	polo	shirt	and	khaki	pants	.
Thank	you	.
So	we	had	been	there	for	20	minutes	;	we	were	happy	to	exit	the	store	.
One	thing	the	 manager 	 s 	 	were	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	was	to	track	down	our	cameras	.
And	they	caught	a	couple	of	my	guys	who	had	hidden	cameras	in	 duff 	 el 	 	bags	.
But	the	one	camera	guy	they	never	caught	was	the	guy	that	went	in	just	with	a	blank	tape	and	went	over	to	the	Best	Buy	camera	department	and	just	put	his	tape	in	one	of	their	cameras	and	 pretend 	 ed 	 	to	shop	.
So	I	like	that	concept	of	 us 	 ing 	 	their	own	technology	against	them	.
I	think	our	best	projects	are	ones	that	are	site	specific	and	happen	at	a	particular	place	for	a	reason	.
And	one	morning	,	I	was	riding	the	subway	.
I	had	to	make	a	transfer	at	the	53rd	St.	stop	where	there	are	these	two	giant	escalators	.
And	it	's	a	very	 depress 	 ing 	 	place	to	be	in	the	morning	,	it	's	very	crowded	.
So	I	decided	to	try	and	stage	something	that	could	make	it	as	happy	as	possible	for	one	morning	.
So	this	was	in	the	winter	of	2009	--	8:30	in	the	morning	.
It	's	morning	rush	hour	.
It	's	very	cold	outside	.
People	are	coming	in	from	Queens	,	 transferr 	 ing 	 	from	the	E	train	to	the	6	train	.
And	they	're	going	up	these	giant	escalators	on	their	way	to	their	jobs	.
Thank	you	.
So	there	's	a	photograph	that	 illustrat 	 es 	 	it	a	little	bit	better	.
He	gave	2,000	high	 five 	 s 	 	that	day	,	and	he	washed	his	hands	before	and	afterward	and	did	not	get	sick	.
And	that	was	done	also	without	permission	,	although	no	one	 see 	 med 	 	to	care	.
So	I	'd	say	over	the	years	,	one	of	the	most	common	 criticism 	 s 	 	I	see	of	Improv	Everywhere	left	 anonymous 	 ly 	 	on	YouTube	comments	is	:	``	These	people	have	too	much	time	on	their	hands	.	''
And	you	know	,	not	everybody	's	going	to	like	everything	you	do	,	and	I	've	 certain 	 ly 	 	developed	a	thick	skin	thanks	to	Internet	comments	,	but	that	one	's	always	 bother 	 ed 	 	me	,	because	we	do	n't	have	too	much	time	on	our	hands	.
The	participants	at	Improv	Everywhere	events	have	just	as	much	leisure	time	as	any	other	New	 York 	 ers 	 	,	they	just	 occasion 	 ally 	 	choose	to	spend	it	in	an	unusual	way	.
You	know	,	every	Saturday	and	Sunday	,	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	each	fall	gather	in	football	 stadium 	 s 	 	to	watch	games	.
And	I	've	never	seen	 any 	 body 	 	comment	,	looking	at	a	football	game	,	saying	,	``	All	those	people	in	the	stands	,	they	have	too	much	time	on	their	hands	.	''
And	of	course	they	do	n't	.
It	's	a	 perfect 	 ly 	 	wonderful	way	to	spent	a	weekend	afternoon	,	watching	a	football	game	in	a	stadium	.
But	I	think	it	's	also	a	 perfect 	 ly 	 	valid	way	to	spend	an	afternoon	freezing	in	place	with	200	people	in	the	Grand	Central	terminal	or	dressing	up	like	a	 ghost 	 buster 	 	and	running	through	the	New	York	Public	Library	.
Or	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	the	same	MP3	as	3,000	other	people	and	dancing	 silent 	 ly 	 	in	a	park	,	or	 burst 	 ing 	 	into	song	in	a	grocery	store	as	part	of	a	spontaneous	musical	,	or	diving	into	the	ocean	in	Coney	Island	wearing	formal	attire	.
You	know	,	as	kids	,	we	're	taught	to	play	.
And	we	're	never	given	a	reason	why	we	should	play	.
It	's	just	acceptable	that	play	is	a	good	thing	.
And	I	think	that	's	sort	of	the	point	of	Improv	Everywhere	.
It	's	that	there	is	no	point	and	that	there	does	n't	have	to	be	a	point	.
We	do	n't	need	a	reason	.
As	long	as	it	's	fun	and	it	 seem 	 s 	 	like	it	's	going	to	be	a	funny	idea	and	it	 seem 	 s 	 	like	the	people	who	witness	it	will	also	have	a	fun	time	,	then	that	's	enough	for	us	.
And	I	think	,	as	adults	,	we	need	to	learn	that	there	's	no	right	or	wrong	way	to	play	.
Thank	you	very	much	.

1639
Don	Levy	:	A	cinematic	journey	through	visual	effects
The	filmmaker	Georges	 Méli 	 ès 	 	was	first	a	magician	.
Now	movies	proved	to	be	the	ultimate	medium	for	magic	.
With	complete	control	of	everything	the	audience	can	see	,	 movie 	 makers 	 	had	developed	an	arsenal	of	techniques	to	further	their	 deception 	 s 	 	.
Motion	pictures	are	themselves	an	illusion	of	life	,	produced	by	the	sequential	projection	of	still	frames	,	and	they	 astonish 	 ed 	 	the	 Lum 	 ière 	 	brothers	'	early	audiences	.
Even	today	's	 s 	 ophisticated 	 	 movie 	 goers 	 	still	lose	themselves	to	the	screen	,	and	 filmmaker 	 s 	 	leverage	this	separation	from	reality	to	great	effect	.
Now	imaginative	people	have	been	having	fun	with	this	for	over	400	years	.
 Giam 	 battista 	 	della	Porta	,	a	Neapolitan	scholar	in	the	16th	century	,	examined	and	studied	the	natural	world	and	saw	how	it	could	be	 manipulat 	 ed 	 	.
Playing	with	the	world	,	and	our	perception	of	it	,	 re 	 ally 	 	is	the	essence	of	visual	effects	.
So	digging	 deep 	 er 	 	into	this	with	the	Science	and	Technology	Council	of	the	Academy	of	Motion	Picture	Arts	and	Sciences	 reveal 	 s 	 	some	truth	behind	the	trickery	.
Visual	effects	are	based	on	the	principles	of	all	 illusion 	 s 	 	:	assumption	,	things	are	as	we	know	them	;	 p 	 resumption 	 	,	things	will	behave	as	we	expect	;	and	context	in	reality	,	our	knowledge	of	the	world	as	we	know	it	,	such	as	scale	.
Now	a	fourth	factor	 re 	 ally 	 	becomes	an	obsession	,	which	is	,	never	betray	the	illusion	.
And	that	last	point	has	made	visual	effects	a	constant	quest	for	perfection	.
So	from	the	 hand 	 - 	 crank 	 ed 	 	jump	cut	early	days	of	cinema	to	last	Sunday	's	Oscar	winner	,	what	follows	are	some	steps	and	a	few	 repeat 	 s 	 	in	the	evolution	of	visual	effects	.
I	hope	you	will	enjoy	.

Dan	Dennett	's	response	to	Rick	Warren
It	's	wonderful	to	be	back	.
I	love	this	wonderful	gathering	.
And	you	must	be	 wonder 	 ing 	 	,	``	What	on	Earth	?
Have	they	put	up	the	wrong	slide	?	''
No	,	no	.
Look	at	this	magnificent	beast	and	ask	the	question	--	who	designed	it	?
This	is	TED	.
This	is	Technology	,	Entertainment	,	Design	and	there	's	a	dairy	cow	.
It	's	a	quite	 wonderful 	 ly 	 	designed	animal	.
And	I	was	thinking	,	how	do	I	 introduc 	 e 	 	this	?
And	I	thought	,	well	,	maybe	that	old	 dogger 	 el 	 	by	Joyce	Kilmer	,	you	know	:	``	Poems	are	made	by	fools	like	me	,	but	only	God	can	make	a	tree	.	''
And	you	might	say	,	``	Well	,	God	designed	the	cow	.	''
But	,	of	course	,	God	got	a	lot	of	help	.
This	is	the	ancestor	of	cattle	.
This	is	the	Oryx	.
And	it	was	designed	by	natural	selection	,	the	process	of	natural	selection	,	over	many	 million 	 s 	 	of	years	.
And	then	it	became	domesticated	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	years	ago	.
And	human	beings	became	its	 steward 	 s 	 	,	and	,	without	even	knowing	what	they	were	 do 	 ing 	 	,	they	 gradual 	 ly 	 	 redesign 	 ed 	 	it	and	 redesign 	 ed 	 	it	and	 redesign 	 ed 	 	it	.
And	then	,	more	 recent 	 ly 	 	,	they	 re 	 ally 	 	began	to	do	sort	of	reverse	engineering	on	this	beast	and	figure	out	just	what	the	parts	were	,	how	they	worked	and	how	they	might	be	optimized	--	how	they	might	be	made	better	.
Now	why	am	I	talking	about	cows	?
Because	I	want	to	say	that	much	the	same	thing	is	true	of	religions	.
Religions	are	natural	phenomena	.
They	're	just	as	natural	as	cows	.
They	have	evolved	over	 millenni 	 a 	 	.
They	have	a	biological	base	,	just	like	the	Oryx	.
They	have	become	domesticated	,	and	human	beings	have	been	 redesign 	 ing 	 	their	religions	for	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	years	.
This	is	TED	,	and	I	want	to	talk	about	design	.
Because	what	I	've	been	 do 	 ing 	 	for	the	last	four	years	,	 re 	 ally 	 	since	the	first	time	you	saw	me	--	some	of	you	saw	me	at	TED	when	I	was	talking	about	religion	,	and	in	the	last	four	years	I	've	been	working	just	about	 non 	 - 	 stop 	 	on	this	topic	.
And	you	might	say	it	's	about	the	reverse	engineering	of	religions	.
Now	that	very	idea	,	I	think	,	strikes	terror	in	many	people	,	or	anger	,	or	anxiety	of	one	sort	or	another	.
And	that	is	the	spell	that	I	want	to	break	.
I	want	to	say	,	no	,	religions	are	an	important	natural	phenomenon	.
We	should	study	them	with	the	same	intensity	that	we	study	all	the	other	important	natural	phenomena	,	like	global	warming	,	as	we	heard	so	 eloquent 	 ly 	 	last	night	from	Al	Gore	.
Today	's	religions	are	 brilliant 	 ly 	 	designed	--	 brilliant 	 ly 	 	designed	.
They	're	 immense 	 ly 	 	powerful	social	institutions	and	many	of	their	features	can	be	traced	back	to	earlier	features	that	we	can	 re 	 ally 	 	make	sense	of	by	reverse	engineering	.
And	,	as	with	the	cow	,	there	's	a	mixture	of	evolutionary	design	,	designed	by	natural	selection	itself	,	and	intelligent	design	--	more	or	less	intelligent	design	--	and	 redesign 	 ed 	 	by	human	beings	who	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	redesign	their	religions	.
You	do	n't	do	book	talks	at	TED	,	but	I	'm	going	to	have	just	one	slide	about	my	book	,	because	there	is	one	message	in	it	which	I	think	this	group	 re 	 ally 	 	needs	to	hear	.
And	I	would	be	very	interested	to	get	your	responses	to	this	.
It	's	the	one	policy	proposal	that	I	make	in	the	book	,	at	this	time	when	I	claim	not	to	know	enough	about	religion	to	know	what	other	policy	proposals	to	make	.
And	it	's	one	that	 echo 	 es 	 	 remark 	 s 	 	that	you	've	heard	already	today	.
Here	's	my	proposal	.
I	'm	going	to	just	take	a	couple	of	minutes	to	explain	it	--	education	in	world	religions	,	on	world	religions	,	for	all	of	our	children	in	primary	school	,	in	high	school	,	in	public	schools	,	in	private	schools	and	in	home	 school 	 ing 	 	.
So	what	I	'm	 propos 	 ing 	 	is	,	just	as	we	require	reading	,	writing	,	arithmetic	,	American	history	,	so	we	should	have	a	curriculum	on	facts	about	all	the	religions	of	the	world	--	about	their	history	,	about	their	 creed 	 s 	 	,	about	their	texts	,	their	music	,	their	 symbolism 	 s 	 	,	their	 prohibition 	 s 	 	,	their	requirements	.
And	this	should	be	presented	 factual 	 ly 	 	,	 s 	 traightforward 	 ly 	 	,	with	no	particular	spin	,	to	all	of	the	children	in	the	country	.
And	as	long	as	you	teach	them	that	,	you	can	teach	them	anything	else	you	like	.
That	,	I	think	,	is	maximal	tolerance	for	religious	freedom	.
As	long	as	you	inform	your	children	about	other	religions	,	then	you	may	--	and	as	early	as	you	like	and	whatever	you	like	--	teach	them	whatever	creed	you	want	them	to	learn	.
But	also	let	them	know	about	other	religions	.
Now	why	do	I	say	that	?
Because	democracy	 depend 	 s 	 	on	an	informed	citizenship	.
 Inform 	 ed 	 	consent	is	the	very	 bed 	 rock 	 	of	our	understanding	of	democracy	.
 Mis 	 informed 	 	consent	is	not	worth	it	.
It	's	like	a	coin	flip	;	it	does	n't	count	 re 	 ally 	 	.
Democracy	 depend 	 s 	 	on	informed	consent	.
This	is	the	way	we	treat	people	as	 responsibl 	 e 	 	adults	.
Now	,	children	below	the	age	of	consent	are	a	special	case	.
I	'm	going	to	use	a	word	that	Pastor	Rick	just	used	--	parents	are	 steward 	 s 	 	of	their	children	.
They	do	n't	own	them	.
You	ca	n't	own	your	children	.
You	have	a	responsibility	to	the	world	,	to	the	state	,	to	them	,	to	take	care	of	them	right	.
You	may	teach	them	whatever	creed	you	think	is	most	important	,	but	I	say	you	have	a	responsibility	to	let	them	be	informed	about	all	the	other	 creed 	 s 	 	in	the	world	,	too	.
The	reason	I	've	taken	this	time	is	I	've	been	 fascin 	 ated 	 	to	hear	some	of	the	reactions	to	this	.
One	 review 	 er 	 	for	a	Roman	Catholic	newspaper	called	it	``	 totalitaria 	 n 	 	.	''
It	strikes	me	as	 practical 	 ly 	 	libertarian	.
Is	it	 totalitaria 	 n 	 	to	require	reading	,	writing	and	arithmetic	?
I	do	n't	think	so	.
All	I	'm	saying	is	--	facts	.	Facts	only	.
No	values	,	just	facts	about	all	the	world	's	religions	.
Another	 review 	 er 	 	called	it	``	 h 	 ilarious 	 	.	''
Well	,	I	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 bother 	 ed 	 	by	the	fact	that	 any 	 body 	 	would	think	that	was	 h 	 ilarious 	 	.
It	 seem 	 s 	 	to	me	to	be	such	a	 plausib 	 le 	 	,	natural	extension	of	the	democratic	principles	we	already	have	,	that	I	'm	 shock 	 ed 	 	to	think	 any 	 body 	 	would	find	that	just	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	.
I	know	many	religions	are	so	anxious	about	preserving	the	purity	of	their	faith	among	their	children	that	they	are	intent	on	keeping	their	children	ignorant	of	other	 faith 	 s 	 	.
I	do	n't	think	that	's	 defens 	 ible 	 	,	but	I	'd	 re 	 ally 	 	be	 please 	 d 	 	to	get	your	answers	on	that	--	any	reactions	to	that	--	later	.
But	now	I	'm	going	to	move	on	.
Back	to	the	cow	.
This	picture	,	which	I	 pull 	 ed 	 	off	the	web	--	the	fellow	on	the	left	is	 re 	 ally 	 	an	important	part	of	this	picture	.
That	's	the	steward	.
Cows	could	n't	live	without	human	 steward 	 s 	 	--	they	're	domesticated	.
They	're	a	sort	of	 ecto 	 symbiont 	 	.
They	depend	on	us	for	their	survival	.
And	Pastor	Rick	was	just	talking	about	sheep	.
I	'm	going	to	talk	about	sheep	,	too	.
There	's	a	lot	of	 serendip 	 itous 	 	convergence	here	.
How	clever	it	was	of	sheep	to	 acquir 	 e 	 	 shepherd 	 s 	 	!
Think	of	what	this	got	them	.
They	could	 out 	 source 	 	all	their	problems	--	protection	from	 predator 	 s 	 	,	food	finding	,	health	maintenance	.
The	only	cost	in	most	 flock 	 s 	 	is	a	loss	of	free	mating	.
What	a	deal	.
``	How	clever	of	sheep	!	''	you	might	say	.
Except	,	of	course	,	it	was	n't	the	sheep	's	 clever 	 ness 	 	.
We	all	know	sheep	are	not	 exact 	 ly 	 	rocket	scientists	--	they	're	not	very	smart	.
It	was	n't	the	 clever 	 ness 	 	of	the	sheep	at	all	.
They	were	 clue 	 less 	 	.
But	it	was	a	very	clever	move	.
Whose	clever	move	was	it	?
It	was	a	clever	move	of	natural	selection	itself	.
Francis	Crick	,	the	 co 	 - 	 discover 	 er 	 	of	the	structure	of	DNA	with	Jim	Watson	,	once	 jok 	 ed 	 	about	what	he	called	Orgel	's	Second	Rule	.
Leslie	Orgel	is	still	a	molecular	biologist	,	brilliant	guy	,	and	Orgel	's	Second	Rule	is	:	Evolution	is	 clever 	 er 	 	than	you	are	.
Now	,	that	is	not	Intelligent	Design	--	not	from	Francis	Crick	.
Evolution	is	 clever 	 er 	 	than	you	are	.
If	you	understand	Orgel	's	Second	Rule	,	then	you	understand	why	the	Intelligent	Design	movement	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	a	hoax	.
The	designs	discovered	by	the	process	of	natural	selection	are	brilliant	,	 un 	 believably 	 	brilliant	.
Again	and	again	biologists	are	 fascin 	 ated 	 	with	the	 brilli 	 ance 	 	of	what	's	discovered	.
But	the	process	itself	is	without	purpose	,	without	foresight	,	without	design	.
When	I	was	here	four	years	ago	,	I	told	the	story	about	an	ant	climbing	a	blade	of	grass	.
And	why	was	the	ant	 do 	 ing 	 	it	?
Well	,	it	's	because	its	brain	had	been	infected	with	a	lancet	fluke	that	was	--	needed	to	get	into	the	belly	of	a	sheep	or	a	cow	in	order	to	 reproduc 	 e 	 	.
It	was	sort	of	a	 s 	 pooky 	 	story	.
And	I	think	some	people	may	have	 mis 	 understood 	 	.
Lancet	 fluke 	 s 	 	are	n't	smart	.
I	submit	that	the	intelligence	of	a	lancet	fluke	is	down	there	 s 	 omewhere 	 	between	 pet 	 unia 	 	and	carrot	.
They	're	not	 re 	 ally 	 	bright	.	They	do	n't	have	to	be	.
The	lesson	we	learn	from	this	is	you	do	n't	have	to	have	a	mind	to	be	a	 benefici 	 ary 	 	.
The	design	is	there	in	nature	,	but	it	's	not	in	 any 	 body 	 	's	head	.
It	does	n't	have	to	be	.
That	's	the	way	evolution	works	.
The	question	--	was	 domestic 	 ation 	 	good	for	sheep	?
It	was	great	for	their	genetic	fitness	.
And	here	I	want	to	 re 	 mind 	 	you	of	a	wonderful	point	that	Paul	 MacC 	 ready 	 	made	at	TED	three	years	ago	.
Here	's	what	he	said	.
10,000	years	ago	at	the	dawn	of	agriculture	,	human	population	,	plus	livestock	and	pets	,	was	approximately	a	tenth	of	one	per	cent	of	the	terrestrial	 vertebra 	 e 	 	 land 	 mass 	 	.
That	was	just	10,000	years	ago	.
Yesterday	,	in	biological	terms	.
What	is	it	today	?	Does	 any 	 body 	 	remember	what	he	told	us	?
98	percent	.
That	is	what	we	have	done	on	this	planet	.
Now	,	I	talked	to	Paul	 afterward 	 s 	 	.
I	wanted	to	check	to	find	out	how	he	'd	calculated	this	,	and	get	the	sources	and	so	forth	.
And	he	gave	me	a	paper	that	he	had	written	on	this	.
There	was	a	passage	in	it	which	he	did	not	present	here	and	I	think	it	is	so	good	I	'm	going	to	read	it	to	you	.
``	Over	 billion 	 s 	 	of	years	on	a	unique	sphere	,	chance	has	painted	a	thin	covering	of	life	:	complex	,	 im 	 probable 	 	,	wonderful	and	fragile	.
Suddenly	,	we	humans	,	a	 recent 	 ly 	 	 arriv 	 ed 	 	species	no	 long 	 er 	 	subject	to	the	 check 	 s 	 	and	 balance 	 s 	 	 i 	 nherent 	 	in	nature	,	have	grown	in	population	,	technology	and	intelligence	to	a	position	of	terrible	power	.
We	now	wield	the	 paint 	 brush 	 	.	''
We	heard	about	the	atmosphere	as	a	thin	layer	of	varnish	.
Life	itself	is	just	a	thin	coat	of	paint	on	this	planet	.
And	we	're	the	ones	that	hold	the	 paint 	 brush 	 	.
And	how	can	we	do	that	?
The	key	to	our	domination	of	the	planet	is	culture	,	and	the	key	to	culture	is	religion	.
Suppose	Martian	scientists	came	to	Earth	.
They	would	be	 puzzle 	 d 	 	by	many	things	.
 Any 	 body 	 	know	what	this	is	?
I	'll	tell	you	what	it	is	.
This	is	a	million	people	gathering	on	the	banks	of	the	Ganges	in	2001	,	 perhap 	 s 	 	the	largest	single	gathering	of	human	beings	ever	,	as	seen	from	satellite	photograph	.
Here	's	a	big	crowd	.
Here	's	another	crowd	in	Mecca	.
 Martian 	 s 	 	would	be	 amaz 	 ed 	 	by	this	.
They	'd	want	to	know	how	it	 originate 	 d 	 	,	what	it	was	for	and	how	it	 perpetua 	 tes 	 	itself	.
Actually	,	I	'm	going	to	pass	over	this	.
The	ant	is	n't	alone	.
There	's	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	wonderful	cases	of	species	.
In	that	case	,	a	parasite	 get 	 s 	 	into	a	mouse	and	it	needs	to	get	into	the	belly	of	a	cat	.
And	it	turns	the	mouse	into	Mighty	Mouse	--	it	makes	it	fearless	,	so	it	runs	out	in	the	open	,	where	it	'll	be	eaten	by	a	cat	.
True	story	.
In	other	words	,	we	have	these	 hijack 	 ers 	 	--	you	've	seen	this	slide	before	,	from	four	years	ago	--	a	parasite	that	 infect 	 s 	 	the	brain	and	 induc 	 es 	 	even	suicidal	behavior	on	 be 	 half 	 	of	a	cause	other	than	one	's	own	genetic	fitness	.
Does	that	ever	happen	to	us	?
Yes	,	it	does	--	quite	 wonderful 	 ly 	 	.
The	Arabic	word	``	Islam	''	means	``	submission	.	''
It	means	``	surrender	of	 self 	 - 	 interest 	 	to	the	will	of	Allah	.	''
But	I	'm	not	just	talking	about	Islam	.
I	'm	talking	also	about	Christianity	.
This	is	a	parchment	music	page	that	I	found	in	a	Paris	 book 	 stall 	 	50	years	ago	.
And	on	it	it	says	,	in	Latin	:	``	Semen	est	 verb 	 um 	 	Dei	.	Sator	 au 	 tem 	 	Christus	.
The	word	of	God	is	the	seed	and	the	 s 	 ower 	 	of	the	seed	is	Christ	.	''
Same	idea	!	Well	,	not	quite	.
But	in	fact	,	Christians	,	too	,	glory	in	the	fact	that	they	have	 surrender 	 ed 	 	to	God	.
I	'll	give	you	a	few	 quote 	 s 	 	.
``	The	heart	of	worship	is	surrender	.
 Surrender 	 ed 	 	people	obey	God	's	words	,	even	if	it	does	n't	make	sense	.	''
Those	words	are	by	Rick	Warren	.
Those	are	from	``	The	Purpose	Driven	Life	.	''
And	I	want	to	turn	now	,	 brief 	 ly 	 	,	to	talk	about	that	book	,	which	I	've	read	.
You	've	all	got	a	copy	.
You	've	just	heard	the	man	.
And	what	I	want	to	do	now	is	say	a	bit	about	this	book	from	the	design	 stand 	 point 	 	,	because	I	think	it	's	actually	a	brilliant	book	.
First	of	all	,	the	goal	.
And	you	heard	just	now	what	the	goal	is	.
It	's	to	bring	purpose	to	the	lives	of	 million 	 s 	 	,	and	he	has	succeeded	.
Is	it	a	good	goal	?
In	itself	,	I	'm	sure	we	all	agree	,	it	is	a	wonderful	goal	.
He	's	 absolute 	 ly 	 	right	.
There	are	lots	of	people	out	there	who	do	n't	have	purpose	in	their	life	,	and	bringing	purpose	to	their	life	is	a	wonderful	goal	.
I	give	him	an	 A 	  	  	 	on	this	.
Is	the	goal	achieved	?
Yes	.
30	million	copies	of	this	book	.
Al	Gore	,	eat	your	heart	out	.
Just	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	Al	is	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	,	Rick	is	 do 	 ing 	 	.
This	is	a	fantastic	achievement	.
And	,	the	means	--	how	does	he	do	it	?
It	's	a	brilliant	redesign	of	traditional	religious	themes	--	 updat 	 ing 	 	them	,	 quiet 	 ly 	 	dropping	obsolete	features	,	putting	new	 interpretation 	 s 	 	on	other	features	.
This	is	the	evolution	of	religion	that	's	been	going	on	for	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	years	,	and	he	's	just	the	latest	brilliant	practitioner	of	it	.
I	do	n't	have	to	tell	you	this	.
You	've	just	heard	the	man	.
Excellent	 insight 	 s 	 	into	human	psychology	,	wise	advice	on	every	page	.
Moreover	,	he	 invite 	 s 	 	us	to	look	under	the	hood	.
I	 re 	 ally 	 	appreciated	that	.
For	instance	,	he	has	an	appendix	where	he	 explain 	 s 	 	his	choice	of	 translation 	 s 	 	of	different	Bible	verses	.
The	book	is	clear	,	vivid	,	accessible	,	 beautiful 	 ly 	 	formatted	.
Just	enough	 re 	 petition 	 	.
That	's	 re 	 ally 	 	important	.
Every	time	you	read	it	or	say	it	,	you	make	another	copy	in	your	brain	.
Every	time	you	read	it	or	say	it	,	you	make	another	copy	in	your	brain	.
With	me	,	everybody	--	every	time	you	read	it	or	say	it	,	you	make	another	copy	in	your	brain	.
Thank	you	.
And	now	we	come	to	my	problem	.
Because	I	'm	 absolute 	 ly 	 	sincere	in	my	appreciation	of	all	that	I	've	said	about	this	book	.
But	I	wish	it	were	better	.
I	have	some	problems	with	the	book	.
And	it	would	just	be	 in 	 sincere 	 	of	me	not	to	address	those	problems	.
I	wish	he	could	do	this	with	a	revision	,	a	Mark	2	version	of	his	book	.
``	The	truth	will	set	you	free	''	--	that	's	what	it	says	in	the	Bible	,	and	it	's	something	that	I	want	to	live	by	,	too	.
My	problem	is	,	some	of	the	bits	in	it	I	do	n't	think	are	true	.
Now	some	of	this	is	a	difference	of	opinion	,	and	that	's	not	my	main	complaint	.
That	's	worth	 mention 	 ing 	 	.
Here	's	a	passage	--	it	's	very	much	what	he	said	,	 any 	 way 	 	.
``	If	there	was	no	God	we	would	all	be	 accident 	 s 	 	,	the	result	of	astronomical	random	chance	in	the	Universe	.
You	could	stop	reading	this	book	because	life	would	have	no	purpose	or	meaning	or	significance	.
There	would	be	no	right	or	wrong	and	no	hope	beyond	your	brief	years	on	Earth	.	''
Now	,	I	just	do	not	believe	that	.
By	the	way	,	I	find	Homer	 Groen 	 ing 	 	's	film	presented	a	beautiful	alternative	to	that	very	claim	.
Yes	,	there	is	meaning	and	a	reason	for	right	or	wrong	.
We	do	n't	need	a	belief	in	God	to	be	good	or	to	have	meaning	in	us	.
But	that	is	just	a	difference	of	opinion	.
That	's	not	what	I	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	worried	about	.
How	about	this	--	``	God	designed	this	planet	's	environment	just	so	we	could	live	in	it	.	''
I	'm	afraid	that	a	lot	of	people	take	that	sentiment	to	mean	that	we	do	n't	have	to	do	the	 sort 	 s 	 	of	things	that	Al	Gore	is	 try 	 ing 	 	so	hard	to	get	us	to	do	.
I	'm	not	happy	with	that	sentiment	at	all	.
And	then	I	find	this	--	``	All	the	evidence	available	in	the	biological	sciences	 support 	 s 	 	the	core	proposition	that	the	cosmos	is	especially	designed	whole	with	life	and	 man 	 kind 	 	as	its	fundamental	goal	and	purpose	,	a	whole	in	which	all	 facet 	 s 	 	of	reality	have	their	meaning	and	explanation	in	this	central	fact	.	''
Well	,	that	's	Michael	Denton	.	He	's	a	 creation 	 ist 	 	.
And	here	I	think	,	``	Wait	a	minute	.	''
I	read	this	again	.
I	read	it	three	or	four	times	and	I	think	,	``	Is	he	 re 	 ally 	 	 endors 	 ing 	 	intelligent	design	?
Is	he	 endors 	 ing 	 	 creation 	 ism 	 	here	?	''
And	you	ca	n't	tell	.
So	I	'm	sort	of	thinking	,	``	Well	,	I	do	n't	know	,	I	do	n't	know	if	I	want	to	get	upset	with	this	yet	.	''
But	then	I	read	on	and	I	read	this	:	``	First	,	Noah	had	never	seen	rain	,	because	prior	to	the	flood	God	irrigated	the	earth	from	the	ground	up	.	''
I	wish	that	sentence	were	n't	in	there	,	because	I	think	it	is	false	.
And	I	think	that	thinking	this	way	about	the	history	of	the	planet	,	after	we	've	just	been	hearing	about	the	history	of	the	planet	over	 million 	 s 	 	of	years	,	 discourage 	 s 	 	people	from	scientific	understanding	.
Now	,	Rick	Warren	uses	scientific	terms	and	scientific	 fact 	 oids 	 	and	information	in	a	very	 interest 	 ing 	 	way	.
Here	's	one	:	``	God	 deliberate 	 ly 	 	shaped	and	formed	you	to	serve	him	in	a	way	that	makes	your	ministry	unique	.
He	 care 	 fully 	 	mixed	the	DNA	cocktail	that	created	you	.	''
I	think	that	's	false	.
Now	maybe	we	want	to	treat	it	as	 metaphor 	 ical 	 	.
Here	's	another	one	--	``	For	instance	,	your	brain	can	store	100	trillion	facts	.
Your	mind	can	handle	15,000	decisions	a	second	.	''
Well	,	it	would	be	 interest 	 ing 	 	to	find	the	interpretation	where	I	would	accept	that	.
There	might	be	some	way	of	treating	that	as	true	.
``	 Anthropologist 	 s 	 	have	noted	that	worship	is	a	universal	urge	,	 hard 	 wired 	 	by	God	into	the	very	fiber	of	our	being	,	an	 in 	 built 	 	need	to	connect	with	God	.	''
Well	,	there	's	a	sense	which	I	agree	with	him	,	except	I	think	it	has	an	evolutionary	explanation	.
And	what	I	find	 deep 	 ly 	 	 troubl 	 ing 	 	in	this	book	is	that	he	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	arguing	that	if	you	want	to	be	moral	,	if	you	want	to	have	meaning	in	your	life	,	you	have	to	be	an	Intelligent	Designer	--	you	have	to	 den 	 y 	 	the	theory	of	evolution	by	natural	selection	.
And	I	think	,	on	the	 contra 	 ry 	 	,	that	it	is	very	important	to	solving	the	world	's	problems	that	we	take	evolutionary	biology	 serious 	 ly 	 	.
Whose	truth	are	we	going	to	listen	to	?
Well	,	this	from	``	The	Purpose	Driven	Life	''	--	``	The	Bible	must	become	the	authoritative	standard	for	my	life	,	the	compass	I	 re 	 ly 	 	on	for	direction	,	the	counsel	I	listen	to	for	making	wise	decisions	and	the	benchmark	I	use	for	 e 	 valuating 	 	everything	.	''
Well	maybe	,	OK	,	but	what	's	going	to	follow	from	this	?
And	here	's	one	that	does	concern	me	.
Remember	I	quoted	him	before	with	this	line	--	``	 Surrender 	 ed 	 	people	obey	God	's	word	,	even	if	it	does	n't	make	sense	.	''
And	that	's	a	problem	.
``	Do	n't	ever	argue	with	the	Devil	.
He	's	better	at	arguing	than	you	are	,	having	had	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	years	to	practice	.	''
Now	Rick	Warren	did	n't	invent	this	clever	move	.
It	's	an	old	move	.
It	's	a	very	clever	adaptation	of	religions	.
It	's	a	wildcard	for	 disarm 	 ing 	 	any	reasonable	criticism	.
``	You	do	n't	like	my	interpretation	?
You	've	got	a	reasonable	objection	to	it	?
Do	n't	listen	,	do	n't	listen	!
That	's	the	Devil	speaking	.	''
This	 discourage 	 s 	 	the	sort	of	reasoning	citizenship	it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	me	that	we	want	to	have	.
I	've	got	one	more	problem	,	then	I	'm	through	.
And	I	'd	 re 	 ally 	 	like	to	get	a	response	if	Rick	is	able	to	do	it	.
``	In	the	Great	Commission	,	Jesus	said	,	'Go	to	all	people	of	all	nations	and	make	them	my	 disciple 	 s 	 	.	Baptize	them	in	the	name	of	the	Father	,	the	Son	and	the	Holy	Spirit	,	and	teach	them	to	do	everything	I	've	told	you	.	'	''	The	Bible	says	Jesus	is	the	only	one	who	can	save	the	world	.
Now	here	we	've	seen	many	wonderful	maps	of	the	world	in	the	last	day	or	so	.
Here	's	one	,	not	as	beautiful	as	the	others	.
It	simply	shows	the	religions	of	the	world	.
And	here	's	one	that	shows	the	sort	of	current	breakdown	of	the	different	religions	.
Now	do	we	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	commit	 our 	 selves 	 	to	 engulf 	 ing 	 	all	the	other	religions	when	their	holy	books	are	telling	them	,	``	Do	n't	listen	to	the	other	side	,	that	's	just	Satan	talking	!	''
It	 seem 	 s 	 	to	me	that	that	's	a	very	problematic	ship	to	get	on	for	the	future	.
I	found	this	sign	as	I	was	driving	to	Maine	 recent 	 ly 	 	,	in	front	of	a	church	--	``	Good	without	God	becomes	zero	.	''
Sort	of	cute	.
A	very	clever	little	meme	.
I	do	n't	believe	it	and	I	think	this	idea	,	popular	as	it	is	--	not	in	this	guise	but	in	general	--	is	itself	one	of	the	main	problems	that	we	face	.
If	you	are	like	me	,	you	know	many	wonderful	,	committed	,	engaged	 atheist 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 gnostic 	 s 	 	,	who	are	being	very	good	without	God	.
And	you	also	know	many	religious	people	who	hide	behind	their	 sancti 	 ty 	 	instead	of	 do 	 ing 	 	good	works	.
So	,	I	wish	we	could	drop	this	meme	.
I	wish	this	meme	would	go	extinct	.
Thanks	very	much	for	your	attention	.

After	a	crisis	,	how	can	we	tell	if	water	is	safe	to	drink	?	Current	tests	are	slow	and	complex	,	and	the	delay	can	be	deadly	,	as	in	the	 chole 	 ra 	 	outbreak	after	Haiti	's	earthquake	in	2010	.	TED	Fellow	 Sona 	 ar 	 	 Luth 	 ra 	 	 preview 	 s 	 	his	design	for	a	simple	tool	that	quickly	tests	water	for	safety	--	the	Water	Canary	.

 Sona 	 ar 	 	 Luth 	 ra 	 	:	Meet	the	Water	Canary
Cholera	was	reported	in	Haiti	for	the	first	time	in	over	50	years	last	October	.
There	was	no	way	to	predict	how	far	it	would	spread	through	water	supplies	and	how	bad	the	situation	would	get	.
And	not	knowing	where	help	was	needed	always	 ensure 	 d 	 	that	help	was	in	short	supply	in	the	areas	that	needed	it	most	.
We	've	gotten	good	at	 predict 	 ing 	 	and	preparing	for	storms	before	they	take	innocent	lives	and	cause	 ir 	 reversible 	 	damage	,	but	we	still	ca	n't	do	that	with	water	,	and	here	's	why	.
Right	now	,	if	you	want	to	test	water	in	the	field	,	you	need	a	trained	technician	,	expensive	equipment	like	this	,	and	you	have	to	wait	about	a	day	for	chemical	reactions	to	take	place	and	provide	results	.
It	's	too	slow	to	get	a	picture	of	conditions	on	the	ground	before	they	change	,	too	expensive	to	implement	in	all	the	places	that	require	testing	.
And	it	 ignore 	 s 	 	the	fact	that	,	in	the	 mean 	 while 	 	,	people	still	need	to	drink	water	.
Most	of	the	information	that	we	collected	on	the	 chole 	 ra 	 	outbreak	did	n't	come	from	testing	water	;	it	came	from	forms	like	this	,	which	documented	all	the	people	we	failed	to	help	.
 Count 	 less 	 	lives	have	been	saved	by	 can 	 aries 	 	in	 coal 	 mines 	 	--	a	simple	and	 in 	 valuable 	 	way	for	miners	to	know	whether	they	're	safe	.
I	've	been	inspired	by	that	 s 	 implicity 	 	as	I	've	been	working	on	this	problem	with	some	of	the	most	 hard 	 working 	 	and	brilliant	people	I	've	ever	known	.
We	think	there	's	a	 simple 	 r 	 	solution	to	this	problem	--	one	that	can	be	used	by	people	who	face	conditions	like	this	everyday	.
It	's	in	its	early	stages	,	but	this	is	what	it	looks	like	right	now	.
We	call	it	the	Water	Canary	.
It	's	a	fast	,	cheap	device	that	answers	an	important	question	:	Is	this	water	 contaminate 	 d 	 	?
It	does	n't	require	any	special	training	.
And	instead	of	waiting	for	chemical	reactions	to	take	place	,	it	uses	light	.
That	means	there	's	no	waiting	for	chemical	reactions	to	take	place	,	no	need	to	use	 reagent 	 s 	 	that	can	run	out	and	no	need	to	be	an	expert	to	get	 action 	 able 	 	information	.
To	test	water	,	you	simply	insert	a	sample	and	,	within	seconds	,	it	either	 display 	 s 	 	a	red	light	,	 indicat 	 ing 	 	 contaminate 	 d 	 	water	,	or	a	green	light	,	 indicat 	 ing 	 	the	sample	is	safe	.
This	will	make	it	possible	for	 any 	 one 	 	to	collect	 life 	 - 	 saving 	 	information	and	to	monitor	water	quality	conditions	as	they	unfold	.
We	're	also	,	on	top	of	that	,	integrating	wireless	 network 	 ing 	 	into	an	affordable	device	with	GPS	and	GSM	.
What	that	means	is	that	each	reading	can	be	 automatic 	 ally 	 	transmitted	to	servers	to	be	mapped	in	real	time	.
With	enough	users	,	maps	like	this	will	make	it	possible	to	take	 preventiv 	 e 	 	action	,	containing	hazards	before	they	turn	into	emergencies	that	take	years	to	recover	from	.
And	then	,	instead	of	taking	days	to	 disseminat 	 e 	 	this	information	to	the	people	who	need	it	most	,	it	can	happen	 automatic 	 ally 	 	.
We	've	seen	how	distributed	networks	,	big	data	and	information	can	transform	society	.
I	think	it	's	time	for	us	to	apply	them	to	water	.
Our	goal	over	the	next	year	is	to	get	Water	Canary	ready	for	the	field	and	to	 open 	 - 	 source 	 	the	hardware	so	that	 any 	 one 	 	can	 contribut 	 e 	 	to	the	development	and	the	evaluation	,	so	we	can	tackle	this	problem	together	.
Thank	you	.

Paul	 Nickle 	 n 	 	:	Tales	of	 ice 	 - 	 bound 	 	 wonder 	 lands 	 
My	journey	to	become	a	polar	specialist	,	 photograph 	 ing 	 	,	 specializ 	 ing 	 	in	the	polar	regions	,	began	when	I	was	four	years	old	,	when	my	family	moved	from	Southern	Canada	to	Northern	Baffin	Island	,	up	by	Greenland	.
There	we	lived	with	the	Inuit	in	the	tiny	Inuit	community	of	200	Inuit	people	,	where	[	we	]	were	one	of	three	 non 	 - 	 Inuit 	 	families	.
And	in	this	community	,	we	did	n't	have	a	television	;	we	did	n't	have	computers	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	radio	.
We	did	n't	even	have	a	telephone	.
All	of	my	time	was	spent	outside	with	the	Inuit	,	playing	.
The	snow	and	the	ice	were	my	 sand 	 box 	 	,	and	the	Inuit	were	my	teachers	.
And	that	's	where	I	became	 tru 	 ly 	 	 obsess 	 ed 	 	with	this	polar	realm	.
And	I	knew	 some 	 day 	 	that	I	was	going	to	do	something	that	had	to	do	with	 try 	 ing 	 	to	share	news	about	it	and	protect	it	.
I	'd	like	to	share	with	you	,	for	just	two	minutes	only	,	some	images	,	a	 cross 	 - 	 section 	 	of	my	work	,	to	the	beautiful	music	by	Brandi	 Carli 	 le 	 	,	``	Have	You	Ever	.	''
I	do	n't	know	why	National	Geographic	has	done	this	,	they	've	never	done	this	before	,	but	they	're	 a 	 llowing 	 	me	to	show	you	a	few	images	from	a	coverage	that	I	've	just	completed	that	is	not	published	yet	.
National	Geographic	does	n't	do	this	,	so	I	'm	very	excited	to	be	able	to	share	this	with	you	.
And	what	these	images	are	--	you	'll	see	them	at	the	start	of	the	slide	show	--	there	's	only	about	four	images	--	but	it	's	of	a	little	bear	that	lives	in	the	Great	Bear	Rainforest	.
It	's	pure	white	,	but	it	's	not	a	polar	bear	.
It	's	a	spirit	bear	,	or	a	 Ker 	 mode 	 	bear	.
There	are	only	200	of	these	bears	left	.
They	're	more	rare	than	the	panda	bear	.
I	sat	there	on	the	river	for	two	months	without	seeing	one	.
I	thought	,	my	career	's	over	.
I	proposed	this	stupid	story	to	National	Geographic	.
What	in	the	heck	was	I	thinking	?
So	I	had	two	months	to	sit	there	and	figure	out	different	ways	of	what	I	was	going	to	do	in	my	next	life	,	after	I	was	a	photographer	,	because	they	were	going	to	fire	me	.
Because	National	Geographic	is	a	magazine	;	they	 re 	 mind 	 	us	all	the	time	:	they	publish	pictures	,	not	 excuse 	 s 	 	.
And	after	two	months	of	sitting	there	--	one	day	,	thinking	that	it	was	all	over	,	this	 incredibl 	 e 	 	big	white	male	came	down	,	right	 be 	 side 	 	me	,	three	feet	away	from	me	,	and	he	went	down	and	 grabb 	 ed 	 	a	fish	and	went	off	in	the	forest	and	ate	it	.
And	then	I	spent	the	entire	day	living	my	childhood	dream	of	walking	around	with	this	bear	through	the	forest	.
He	went	through	this	 old 	 - 	 growth 	 	forest	and	sat	up	 be 	 side 	 	this	400-year-old	 cultural 	 ly 	 	modified	tree	and	went	to	sleep	.
And	I	actually	got	to	sleep	within	three	feet	of	him	,	just	in	the	forest	,	and	photograph	him	.
So	I	'm	very	excited	to	be	able	to	show	you	those	images	and	a	 cross 	 - 	 section 	 	of	my	work	that	I	've	done	on	the	polar	regions	.
Please	enjoy	.
My	clock	is	 tick 	 ing 	 	.	Okay	,	let	's	stop	.
Thank	you	very	much	.	I	appreciate	it	.
We	're	 inunda 	 ted 	 	with	news	all	the	time	that	the	sea	ice	is	 disappear 	 ing 	 	and	it	's	at	its	 lo 	 west 	 	level	.
And	in	fact	,	scientists	were	 original 	 ly 	 	saying	sea	ice	is	going	to	disappear	in	the	next	hundred	years	,	then	they	said	50	years	.
Now	they	're	saying	the	sea	ice	in	the	Arctic	,	the	 summer 	 time 	 	extent	is	going	to	be	gone	in	the	next	four	to	10	years	.
And	what	does	that	mean	?
After	a	while	of	reading	this	in	the	news	,	it	just	becomes	news	.
You	glaze	over	with	it	.
And	what	I	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	my	work	is	put	faces	to	this	.
And	I	want	people	to	understand	and	get	the	concept	that	,	if	we	lose	ice	,	we	stand	to	lose	an	entire	ecosystem	.
 Projection 	 s 	 	are	that	we	could	lose	polar	bears	;	they	could	become	extinct	in	the	next	50	to	100	years	.
And	there	's	no	better	,	 sex 	 ier 	 	,	more	beautiful	,	charismatic	 mega 	 fauna 	 	species	for	me	to	hang	my	campaign	on	.
Polar	bears	are	amazing	hunters	.
This	was	a	bear	I	sat	with	for	a	while	on	the	 shore 	 s 	 	.
There	was	no	ice	around	.
But	this	glacier	 cave 	 d 	 	into	the	water	and	a	seal	got	on	it	.
And	this	bear	swam	out	to	that	seal	--	800	lb	.	 beard 	 ed 	 	seal	--	 grabb 	 ed 	 	it	,	swam	back	and	ate	it	.
And	he	was	so	full	,	he	was	so	happy	and	so	fat	eating	this	seal	,	that	,	as	I	 approach 	 ed 	 	him	--	about	20	feet	away	--	to	get	this	picture	,	his	only	defense	was	to	keep	eating	more	seal	.
And	as	he	ate	,	he	was	so	full	--	he	probably	had	about	200	lbs	of	meat	in	his	belly	--	and	as	he	ate	inside	one	side	of	his	mouth	,	he	was	 regurgit 	 ating 	 	out	the	other	side	of	his	mouth	.
So	as	long	as	these	bears	have	any	bit	of	ice	they	will	survive	,	but	it	's	the	ice	that	's	 disappear 	 ing 	 	.
We	're	finding	more	and	more	dead	bears	in	the	Arctic	.
When	I	worked	on	polar	bears	as	a	biologist	20	years	ago	,	we	never	found	dead	bears	.
And	in	the	last	four	or	five	years	,	we	're	finding	dead	bears	popping	up	all	over	the	place	.
We	're	seeing	them	in	the	Beaufort	Sea	,	floating	in	the	open	ocean	where	the	ice	has	melted	out	.
I	found	a	couple	in	Norway	last	year	.	We	're	seeing	them	on	the	ice	.
These	bears	are	already	showing	signs	of	the	stress	of	 disappear 	 ing 	 	ice	.
Here	's	a	mother	and	her	two	 year 	 - 	 old 	 	cub	were	 travel 	 ing 	 	on	a	ship	a	hundred	miles	offshore	in	the	middle	of	nowhere	,	and	they	're	riding	on	this	big	piece	of	glacier	ice	,	which	is	great	for	them	;	they	're	safe	at	this	point	.
They	're	not	going	to	die	of	 hypo 	 thermia 	 	.
They	're	going	to	get	to	land	.
But	 unfortunat 	 ely 	 	,	95	percent	of	the	 glacier 	 s 	 	in	the	Arctic	are	also	 re 	 ceding 	 	right	now	to	the	point	that	the	ice	is	ending	up	on	land	and	not	 inject 	 ing 	 	any	ice	back	into	the	ecosystem	.
These	 ring 	 ed 	 	 seal 	 s 	 	,	these	are	the	``	 fat 	 s 	 icles 	 	''	of	the	Arctic	.
These	little	,	fat	 dump 	 lings 	 	,	150-pound	bundles	of	blubber	are	the	 main 	 stay 	 	of	the	polar	bear	.
And	they	're	not	like	the	harbor	 seal 	 s 	 	that	you	have	here	.
These	 ring 	 ed 	 	 seal 	 s 	 	also	live	out	their	entire	life	cycle	associated	and	connected	to	sea	ice	.
They	give	birth	inside	the	ice	,	and	they	feed	on	the	Arctic	cod	that	live	under	the	ice	.
And	here	's	a	picture	of	sick	ice	.
This	is	a	piece	of	 multi 	 - 	 year 	 	ice	that	's	12	years	old	.
And	what	scientists	did	n't	predict	is	that	,	as	this	ice	melts	,	these	big	pockets	of	black	water	are	forming	and	they	're	 grabb 	 ing 	 	the	sun	's	energy	and	 accelerat 	 ing 	 	the	melting	process	.
And	here	we	are	diving	in	the	Beaufort	Sea	.
The	visibility	's	600	 ft 	 . 	 	;	we	're	on	our	safety	lines	;	the	ice	is	moving	all	over	the	place	.
I	wish	I	could	spend	half	an	hour	telling	you	about	how	we	almost	died	on	this	dive	.
But	what	's	important	in	this	picture	is	that	you	have	a	piece	of	 multi 	 - 	 year 	 	ice	,	that	big	chunk	of	ice	up	in	the	corner	.
In	that	one	single	piece	of	ice	,	you	have	300	species	of	 micro 	 organisms 	 	.
And	in	the	spring	,	when	the	sun	returns	to	the	ice	,	it	forms	the	phytoplankton	,	 grow 	 s 	 	under	that	ice	,	and	then	you	get	 bigg 	 er 	 	sheets	of	 sea 	 weed 	 	,	and	then	you	get	the	zoo	plankton	feeding	on	all	that	life	.
So	 re 	 ally 	 	what	the	ice	does	is	it	acts	like	a	garden	.
It	acts	like	the	soil	in	a	garden	.	It	's	an	 in 	 verted 	 	garden	.
Losing	that	ice	is	like	losing	the	soil	in	a	garden	.
Here	's	me	in	my	office	.
I	hope	you	appreciate	 your 	 s 	 	.
This	is	after	an	hour	under	the	ice	.
I	ca	n't	feel	my	lips	;	my	face	is	frozen	;	I	ca	n't	feel	my	hands	;	I	ca	n't	feel	my	feet	.
And	I	've	come	up	,	and	all	I	wanted	to	do	was	get	out	of	the	water	.
After	an	hour	in	these	conditions	,	it	's	so	extreme	that	,	when	I	go	down	,	almost	every	dive	I	vomit	into	my	regulator	because	my	body	ca	n't	deal	with	the	stress	of	the	cold	on	my	head	.
And	so	I	'm	just	so	happy	that	the	dive	is	over	.
I	get	to	hand	my	camera	to	my	assistant	,	and	I	'm	looking	up	at	him	,	and	I	'm	going	,	``	Woo	.	Woo	.	Woo	.	''
Which	means	,	``	Take	my	camera	.	''
And	he	 think 	 s 	 	I	'm	saying	,	``	Take	my	picture	.	''
So	we	had	this	little	communication	breakdown	.
But	it	's	worth	it	.
I	'm	going	to	show	you	pictures	of	 bel 	 uga 	 	whales	,	 bow 	 head 	 	whales	,	and	 narwhal 	 s 	 	,	and	polar	bears	,	and	leopard	 seal 	 s 	 	today	,	but	this	picture	right	here	means	more	to	me	than	any	other	I	've	ever	made	.
I	dropped	down	in	this	ice	hole	,	just	through	that	hole	that	you	just	saw	,	and	I	looked	up	under	the	 under 	 side 	 	of	the	ice	,	and	I	was	dizzy	;	I	thought	I	had	vertigo	.
I	got	very	nervous	--	no	rope	,	no	safety	line	,	the	whole	world	is	moving	around	me	--	and	I	thought	,	``	I	'm	in	trouble	.	''
But	what	happened	is	that	the	entire	 under 	 side 	 	was	full	of	these	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 amphi 	 pods 	 	and	 copepod 	 s 	 	moving	around	and	feeding	on	the	 under 	 side 	 	of	the	ice	,	giving	birth	and	living	out	their	entire	life	cycle	.
This	is	the	foundation	of	the	whole	food	chain	in	the	Arctic	,	right	here	.
And	when	you	have	low	productivity	in	this	,	in	ice	,	the	productivity	in	 copepod 	 s 	 	go	down	.
This	is	a	 bow 	 head 	 	whale	.
 Suppos 	 edly 	 	,	science	is	stating	that	it	could	be	the	oldest	living	animal	on	earth	right	now	.
This	very	whale	right	here	could	be	over	250	years	old	.
This	whale	could	have	been	born	around	the	start	of	the	Industrial	Revolution	.
It	could	have	 surviv 	 ed 	 	150	years	of	whaling	.
And	now	its	biggest	threat	is	the	 dis 	 appearance 	 	of	ice	in	the	North	because	of	the	lives	that	we	're	leading	in	the	South	.
 Narwhal 	 s 	 	,	these	majestic	 narwhal 	 s 	 	with	their	 eight 	 - 	 foot 	 	long	ivory	 tusk 	 s 	 	,	do	n't	have	to	be	here	;	they	could	be	out	on	the	open	water	.
But	they	're	forcing	themselves	to	come	up	in	these	tiny	little	ice	holes	where	they	can	breathe	,	catch	a	breath	,	because	right	under	that	ice	are	all	the	swarms	of	cod	.
And	the	cod	are	there	because	they	are	feeding	on	all	the	 copepod 	 s 	 	and	 amphi 	 pods 	 	.
Alright	,	my	 favorit 	 e 	 	part	.
When	I	'm	on	my	 death 	 bed 	 	,	I	'm	going	to	remember	one	story	more	than	any	other	.
Even	though	that	spirit	bear	moment	was	powerful	,	I	do	n't	think	I	'll	ever	have	another	experience	like	I	did	with	these	leopard	 seal 	 s 	 	.
Leopard	 seal 	 s 	 	,	since	the	time	of	Shackleton	,	have	had	a	bad	reputation	.
They	've	got	that	 wry 	 ly 	 	smile	on	their	mouth	.
They	've	got	those	black	sinister	eyes	and	those	spots	on	their	body	.
They	look	 positive 	 ly 	 	 pre 	 historic 	 	and	a	bit	 s 	 cary 	 	.
And	 tragic 	 ally 	 	in	[	2003	]	,	a	scientist	was	taken	down	and	 drown 	 ed 	 	,	and	she	was	being	consumed	by	a	leopard	seal	.
And	people	were	like	,	``	We	knew	they	were	vicious	.	We	knew	they	were	.	''
And	so	people	love	to	form	their	opinions	.
And	that	's	when	I	got	a	story	idea	:	I	want	to	go	to	Antarctica	,	get	in	the	water	with	as	many	leopard	 seal 	 s 	 	as	I	possibly	can	and	give	them	a	fair	shake	--	find	out	if	they	 re 	 ally 	 	are	these	vicious	animals	,	or	if	they	're	 mis 	 understood 	 	.
So	this	is	that	story	.
Oh	,	and	they	also	happen	to	eat	happy	feet	.
As	a	species	,	as	humans	,	we	like	to	say	 penguin 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	cute	,	therefore	,	leopard	 seal 	 s 	 	eat	them	,	so	leopard	 seal 	 s 	 	are	ugly	and	bad	.
It	does	n't	work	that	way	.
The	penguin	does	n't	know	it	's	cute	,	and	the	leopard	seal	does	n't	know	it	's	kind	of	big	and	 monstro 	 us 	 	.
This	is	just	the	food	chain	 un 	 folding 	 	.
They	're	also	big	.
They	're	not	these	little	harbor	 seal 	 s 	 	.
They	are	12	 ft 	 . 	 	long	,	a	thousand	pounds	.
And	they	're	also	 curious 	 ly 	 	 a 	 ggressive 	 	.
You	get	12	 tourist 	 s 	 	packed	into	a	Zodiac	,	floating	in	these	 ic 	 y 	 	waters	,	and	a	leopard	seal	comes	up	and	bites	the	pontoon	.
The	boat	starts	to	sink	,	they	race	back	to	the	ship	and	get	to	go	home	and	tell	the	stories	of	how	they	got	 attack 	 ed 	 	.
All	the	leopard	seal	was	 do 	 ing 	 	--	it	's	just	 bit 	 ing 	 	a	balloon	.
It	just	 see 	 s 	 	this	big	balloon	in	the	ocean	--	it	does	n't	have	hands	--	it	's	going	to	take	a	little	bite	,	the	boat	pops	,	and	off	they	go	.
So	after	five	days	of	crossing	the	Drake	Passage	--	is	n't	that	beautiful	.
After	five	days	of	crossing	the	Drake	Passage	,	we	have	finally	 arriv 	 ed 	 	at	Antarctica	.
I	'm	with	my	Swedish	assistant	and	guide	.
His	name	is	Goran	 Ehl 	 me 	 	from	Sweden	--	Goran	.
And	he	has	a	lot	of	experience	with	leopard	 seal 	 s 	 	.	I	have	never	seen	one	.
So	we	come	around	the	cove	in	our	little	Zodiac	boat	,	and	there	's	this	 monstro 	 us 	 	leopard	seal	.
And	even	in	his	voice	,	he	goes	,	``	That	's	a	 blood 	 y 	 	big	seal	,	ya	.	''
And	this	seal	is	taking	this	penguin	by	the	head	,	and	it	's	flipping	it	back	and	forth	.
And	what	it	's	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	is	turn	that	penguin	 inside 	 - 	 out 	 	,	so	it	can	eat	the	meat	off	the	bones	,	and	then	it	goes	off	and	 get 	 s 	 	another	one	.
And	so	this	leopard	seal	 grabb 	 ed 	 	another	penguin	,	came	under	the	boat	,	the	Zodiac	,	starting	hitting	the	hull	of	the	boat	.
And	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	not	fall	in	the	water	.
And	we	sit	down	,	and	that	's	when	Goran	said	to	me	,	``	This	is	a	good	seal	,	ya	.
It	's	time	for	you	to	get	in	the	water	.	''
And	I	looked	at	Goran	,	and	I	said	to	him	,	``	Forget	that	.	''
But	I	think	I	probably	used	a	different	word	starting	with	the	letter	F	.
But	he	was	right	.
He	 scold 	 ed 	 	me	out	,	and	said	,	``	This	is	why	we	're	here	.
And	you	 purpose 	 d 	 	this	stupid	story	to	National	Geographic	.
And	now	you	've	got	to	deliver	.
And	you	ca	n't	publish	 excuse 	 s 	 	.	''
So	I	had	such	dry	mouth	--	probably	not	as	bad	as	now	--	but	I	had	such	,	such	dry	mouth	.
And	my	legs	were	just	trembling	.	I	could	n't	feel	my	legs	.
I	put	my	 flipper 	 s 	 	on	.	I	could	 bare 	 ly 	 	part	my	lips	.
I	put	my	snorkel	in	my	mouth	,	and	I	rolled	over	the	side	of	the	Zodiac	into	the	water	.
And	this	was	the	first	thing	she	did	.
She	came	racing	up	to	me	,	 engulf 	 ed 	 	my	whole	camera	--	and	her	teeth	are	up	here	and	down	here	--	but	Goran	,	before	I	had	gotten	in	the	water	,	had	given	me	amazing	advice	.
He	said	,	``	If	you	get	scared	,	you	close	your	eyes	,	ya	,	and	she	'll	go	away	.	''
So	that	's	all	I	had	to	work	with	at	that	point	.
But	I	just	started	to	shoot	these	pictures	.
So	she	did	this	threat	display	for	a	few	minutes	,	and	then	the	most	amazing	thing	happened	--	she	totally	 relax 	 ed 	 	.
She	went	off	,	she	got	a	penguin	.
She	stopped	about	10	feet	away	from	me	,	and	she	sat	there	with	this	penguin	,	the	penguin	's	 f 	 lapping 	 	,	and	she	let	's	it	go	.
The	penguin	 swim 	 s 	 	toward	me	,	takes	off	.
She	 grab 	 s 	 	another	one	.	She	does	this	over	and	over	.
And	it	 dawn 	 ed 	 	on	me	that	she	's	 try 	 ing 	 	to	feed	me	a	penguin	.
Why	else	would	she	release	these	 penguin 	 s 	 	at	me	?
And	after	she	did	this	four	or	five	times	,	she	swam	by	me	with	this	 de 	 jected 	 	look	on	her	face	.
You	do	n't	want	to	be	too	 anthropomorph 	 ic 	 	,	but	I	swear	that	she	looked	at	me	like	,	``	This	useless	predator	's	going	to	 star 	 ve 	 	in	my	ocean	.	''
So	 realiz 	 ing 	 	I	could	n't	catch	swimming	 penguin 	 s 	 	,	she	'd	get	these	other	 penguin 	 s 	 	and	bring	them	 slow 	 ly 	 	towards	me	,	 bob 	 bing 	 	like	this	,	and	she	'd	let	them	go	.
This	did	n't	work	.
I	was	 laugh 	 ing 	 	so	hard	and	so	emotional	that	my	mask	was	flooding	,	because	I	was	crying	 under 	 water 	 	,	just	because	it	was	so	amazing	.
And	so	that	did	n't	work	.
So	then	she	'd	get	another	penguin	and	try	this	 ballet 	 - 	 like 	 	sexy	display	sliding	down	this	 ice 	 berg 	 	like	this	.
And	she	would	sort	of	bring	them	over	to	me	and	offer	it	to	me	.
This	went	on	for	four	days	.
This	just	did	n't	happen	a	couple	of	times	.
And	then	so	she	 re 	 alized 	 	I	could	n't	catch	live	ones	,	so	she	brought	me	dead	 penguin 	 s 	 	.
Now	I	've	got	four	or	five	 penguin 	 s 	 	floating	around	my	head	,	and	I	'm	just	sitting	there	shooting	away	.
And	she	would	often	stop	and	have	this	 de 	 jected 	 	look	on	her	face	like	,	``	Are	you	for	real	?	''
Because	she	ca	n't	believe	I	ca	n't	eat	this	penguin	.
Because	in	her	world	,	you	're	either	breeding	or	you	're	eating	--	and	I	'm	not	breeding	,	so	...
And	then	that	was	n't	enough	;	she	started	to	flip	 penguin 	 s 	 	onto	my	head	.
She	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 force 	 - 	 feed 	 	me	.	She	's	 push 	 ing 	 	me	around	.
She	's	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 force 	 - 	 feed 	 	my	camera	,	which	is	every	photographer	's	dream	.
And	she	would	get	 frustrat 	 ed 	 	;	she	'd	blow	 bubble 	 s 	 	in	my	face	.
She	would	,	I	think	,	let	me	know	that	I	was	going	to	 star 	 ve 	 	.
But	yet	she	did	n't	stop	.
She	would	not	stop	 try 	 ing 	 	to	feed	me	 penguin 	 s 	 	.
And	on	the	last	day	with	this	female	where	I	thought	I	had	 push 	 ed 	 	her	too	far	,	I	got	nervous	because	she	came	up	to	me	,	she	rolled	over	on	her	back	,	and	she	did	this	deep	,	guttural	 jack 	 hammer 	 	sound	,	this	 gok 	 gok 	 gok 	 gok 	 	.
And	I	thought	,	she	's	about	to	bite	.
She	's	about	to	let	me	know	she	's	too	 frustrat 	 ed 	 	with	me	.
What	had	happened	was	another	seal	had	 s 	 nuck 	 	in	behind	me	,	and	she	did	that	to	threat	display	.
She	chased	that	big	seal	away	,	went	and	got	its	penguin	and	brought	it	to	me	.
That	was	n't	the	only	seal	I	got	in	the	water	with	.
I	got	in	the	water	with	30	other	leopard	 seal 	 s 	 	,	and	I	never	once	had	a	 s 	 cary 	 	encounter	.
They	are	the	most	 remarkabl 	 e 	 	animals	I	've	ever	worked	with	,	and	the	same	with	polar	bears	.
And	just	like	the	polar	bears	,	these	animals	depend	on	an	 ic 	 y 	 	environment	.
I	get	emotional	.	Sorry	.
It	's	a	story	that	lives	deep	in	my	heart	,	and	I	'm	proud	to	share	this	with	you	.
And	I	'm	so	passionate	about	it	.
 Any 	 body 	 	want	to	come	with	me	to	Antarctica	or	the	Arctic	,	I	'll	take	you	;	let	's	go	.
We	've	got	to	get	the	story	out	now	.	Thank	you	very	much	.
Thank	you	.
Thank	you	.
Thank	you	.	Thanks	very	much	.

Julian	Treasure	:	Shh	!	Sound	health	in	8	steps
The	Hindus	say	,	``	Nada	brahma	,	''	one	translation	of	which	is	,	``	The	world	is	sound	.	''
And	in	a	way	,	that	's	true	,	because	everything	is	 vibrat 	 ing 	 	.
In	fact	,	all	of	you	as	you	sit	here	right	now	are	 vibrat 	 ing 	 	.
Every	part	of	your	body	is	 vibrat 	 ing 	 	at	different	frequencies	.
So	you	are	,	in	fact	,	a	chord	--	each	of	you	an	individual	chord	.
One	definition	of	health	may	be	that	that	chord	is	in	complete	harmony	.
Your	ears	ca	n't	hear	that	chord	;	they	can	actually	hear	amazing	things	.	Your	ears	can	hear	10	 octave 	 s 	 	.
 Incidental 	 ly 	 	,	we	see	just	one	octave	.
Your	ears	are	always	on	--	you	have	no	ear	lids	.
They	work	even	when	you	sleep	.
The	smallest	sound	you	can	 perceiv 	 e 	 	moves	your	 ear 	 drum 	 	just	four	atomic	 diameter 	 s 	 	.
The	 loud 	 est 	 	sound	you	can	hear	is	a	trillion	times	more	powerful	than	that	.
Ears	are	made	not	for	hearing	,	but	for	 listen 	 ing 	 	.
Listening	is	an	active	skill	,	whereas	hearing	is	passive	,	 listen 	 ing 	 	is	something	that	we	have	to	work	at	--	it	's	a	relationship	with	sound	.
And	yet	it	's	a	skill	that	none	of	us	are	taught	.
For	example	,	have	you	ever	considered	that	there	are	 listen 	 ing 	 	positions	,	places	you	can	listen	from	?
Here	are	two	of	them	.
 Re 	 ductive 	 	 listen 	 ing 	 	is	 listen 	 ing 	 	``	for	.	''
It	 reduce 	 s 	 	everything	down	to	what	's	relevant	and	it	 discard 	 s 	 	everything	that	's	not	relevant	.
Men	typically	listen	 reductive 	 ly 	 	.
So	he	's	saying	,	``	I	've	got	this	problem	.	''
He	's	saying	,	``	Here	's	your	solution	.	Thanks	very	much	.	Next	.	''
That	's	the	way	we	talk	,	right	guys	?
 Expansi 	 ve 	 	 listen 	 ing 	 	,	on	the	other	hand	,	is	 listen 	 ing 	 	``	with	,	''	not	 listen 	 ing 	 	``	for	.	''
It	's	got	no	destination	in	mind	--	it	's	just	 enjoy 	 ing 	 	the	journey	.
Women	typically	listen	 expansive 	 ly 	 	.
If	you	look	at	these	two	,	eye	contact	,	facing	each	other	,	possibly	both	talking	at	the	same	time	.
Men	,	if	you	get	nothing	else	out	of	this	talk	,	practice	expansive	 listen 	 ing 	 	,	and	you	can	transform	your	relationships	.
The	trouble	with	 listen 	 ing 	 	is	that	so	much	of	what	we	hear	is	noise	,	 surround 	 ing 	 	us	all	the	time	.
Noise	like	this	,	according	to	the	European	Union	,	is	reducing	the	health	and	the	quality	of	life	of	25	percent	of	the	population	of	Europe	.
Two	percent	of	the	population	of	Europe	--	that	's	16	million	people	--	are	having	their	sleep	 deva 	 stated 	 	by	noise	like	that	.
200,000	people	a	year	in	Europe	.
It	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	big	problem	.
Now	,	when	you	were	little	,	if	you	had	noise	and	you	did	n't	want	to	hear	it	,	you	'd	stick	your	fingers	in	your	ears	and	hum	.
These	days	,	you	can	do	a	similar	thing	,	it	just	looks	a	bit	cooler	.
It	looks	a	bit	like	this	.
The	trouble	with	widespread	 head 	 phone 	 	use	is	it	 bring 	 s 	 	three	 re 	 ally 	 	big	health	issues	.
The	first	 re 	 ally 	 	big	health	issue	is	a	word	that	Murray	Schafer	 coin 	 ed 	 	:	It	's	a	 dis 	 location 	 	between	what	you	see	and	what	you	hear	.
So	,	we	're	 invit 	 ing 	 	into	our	lives	the	voices	of	people	who	are	not	present	with	us	.
I	think	there	's	something	 deep 	 ly 	 	 un 	 healthy 	 	about	living	all	the	time	in	 schizo 	 phonia 	 	.
The	second	problem	that	comes	with	 head 	 phone 	 	abuse	is	compression	.
We	squash	music	to	fit	it	into	our	pocket	and	there	is	a	cost	attached	to	this	.
Listen	to	this	--	this	is	an	 un 	 compressed 	 	piece	of	music	.
And	now	the	same	piece	of	music	with	98	percent	of	the	data	removed	.
I	do	hope	that	some	of	you	at	least	can	hear	the	difference	between	those	two	.
There	is	a	cost	of	compression	.
It	makes	you	tired	and	 irrit 	 able 	 	to	have	to	make	up	all	of	that	data	.
You	're	having	to	imagine	it	.
It	's	not	good	for	you	in	the	long	run	.
The	third	problem	with	 head 	 phones 	 	is	this	:	 deaf 	 ness 	 	--	 noise 	 - 	 induced 	 	hearing	disorder	.
Ten	million	Americans	already	have	this	for	one	reason	or	another	,	but	 re 	 ally 	 	 worry 	 ingly 	 	,	16	percent	--	 rough 	 ly 	 	one	in	six	--	of	American	 teenager 	 s 	 	suffer	from	 noise 	 - 	 induced 	 	hearing	disorder	as	a	result	of	 head 	 phone 	 	abuse	.
One	study	at	an	American	university	found	that	61	percent	of	college	 fresh 	 men 	 	had	damaged	hearing	as	a	result	of	 head 	 phone 	 	abuse	.
We	may	be	raising	an	entire	generation	of	deaf	people	.
Now	that	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	serious	problem	.
I	'll	give	you	three	quick	tips	to	protect	your	ears	and	pass	these	on	to	your	children	,	please	.
Professional	hearing	 protector 	 s 	 	are	great	;	I	use	some	all	the	time	.
If	you	're	going	to	use	 head 	 phones 	 	,	buy	the	best	ones	you	can	afford	because	quality	means	you	do	n't	have	to	have	it	so	loud	.
If	you	ca	n't	hear	 some 	 body 	 	talking	to	you	in	a	loud	voice	,	it	's	too	loud	.
And	 third 	 ly 	 	,	if	you	're	in	bad	sound	,	it	's	fine	to	put	your	fingers	in	your	ears	or	just	move	away	from	it	.
Protect	your	ears	in	that	way	.
Let	's	move	away	from	bad	sound	and	look	at	some	friends	that	I	urge	you	to	seek	out	.
WWB	:	Wind	,	water	,	birds	--	stochastic	natural	sounds	composed	of	lots	of	individual	random	events	,	all	of	it	very	healthy	,	all	of	it	sound	that	we	evolved	to	over	the	years	.
Seek	those	sounds	out	;	they	're	good	for	you	and	so	it	this	.
Silence	is	beautiful	.
The	 Elizabeth 	 ans 	 	described	language	as	 decorat 	 ed 	 	silence	.
I	urge	you	to	move	away	from	silence	with	intention	and	to	design	 sound 	 scapes 	 	just	like	works	of	art	.
Have	a	 fore 	 ground 	 	,	a	background	,	all	in	beautiful	proportion	.
It	's	fun	to	get	into	 design 	 ing 	 	with	sound	.
If	you	ca	n't	do	it	yourself	,	get	a	professional	to	do	it	for	you	.
Sound	design	is	the	future	,	and	I	think	it	's	the	way	we	're	going	to	change	the	way	the	world	sounds	.
I	'm	going	to	just	run	quickly	through	eight	 modal 	 ities 	 	,	eight	ways	sound	can	improve	health	.
First	,	ultrasound	:	we	're	very	familiar	with	it	from	physical	therapy	;	it	's	also	now	being	used	to	treat	cancer	.
 Litho 	 tripsy 	 	--	saving	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	a	year	from	the	scalpel	by	 pulver 	 izing 	 	stones	with	 high 	 - 	 intensity 	 	sound	.
Sound	healing	is	a	wonderful	modality	.
It	's	been	around	for	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	years	.
I	do	urge	you	to	explore	this	.
There	are	great	things	being	done	there	,	treating	now	autism	,	dementia	and	other	conditions	.
And	music	,	of	course	.	Just	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	music	is	good	for	you	,	if	it	's	music	that	's	made	with	good	intention	,	made	with	love	,	generally	.
Devotional	music	,	good	--	Mozart	,	good	.
There	are	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	types	of	music	that	are	very	healthy	.
And	four	 modal 	 ities 	 	where	you	need	to	take	some	action	and	get	involved	.
First	of	all	,	listen	 conscious 	 ly 	 	.
I	hope	that	that	after	this	talk	you	'll	be	 do 	 ing 	 	that	.
It	's	a	whole	new	dimension	to	your	life	and	it	's	wonderful	to	have	that	dimension	.
 Second 	 ly 	 	,	get	in	touch	with	making	some	sound	--	create	sound	.
The	voice	is	the	instrument	we	all	play	,	and	yet	how	many	of	us	are	trained	in	 us 	 ing 	 	our	voice	?	Get	trained	;	learn	to	 s 	 ing 	 	,	learn	to	play	an	instrument	.
Musicians	have	 bigg 	 er 	 	brains	--	it	's	true	.
You	can	do	this	in	groups	as	well	.
It	's	a	fantastic	 antidot 	 e 	 	to	 schizo 	 phonia 	 	;	to	make	music	and	sound	in	a	group	of	people	,	 which 	 ever 	 	style	you	enjoy	 particular 	 ly 	 	.
And	let	's	take	a	 steward 	 ing 	 	role	for	the	sound	around	us	.
Protect	your	ears	?	Yes	,	 absolute 	 ly 	 	.
Design	 sound 	 scapes 	 	to	be	beautiful	around	you	at	home	and	at	work	.
And	let	's	start	to	speak	up	when	people	are	 assail 	 ing 	 	us	with	the	noise	that	I	played	you	early	on	.
So	I	'm	going	to	leave	you	with	seven	things	you	can	do	right	now	to	improve	your	health	with	sound	.
My	vision	is	of	a	world	that	sounds	beautiful	and	if	we	all	start	 do 	 ing 	 	these	things	,	we	will	take	a	very	big	step	in	that	direction	.
So	I	urge	you	to	take	that	path	.
I	'm	leaving	you	with	a	little	more	 bird 	 song 	 	,	which	is	very	good	for	you	.
I	wish	you	sound	health	.

Janna	Levin	:	The	sound	the	universe	makes
I	want	to	ask	you	all	to	consider	for	a	second	the	very	simple	fact	that	,	by	far	,	most	of	what	we	know	about	the	universe	comes	to	us	from	light	.
We	can	stand	on	the	Earth	and	look	up	at	the	night	sky	and	see	stars	with	our	bare	eyes	.
The	Sun	 burn 	 s 	 	our	peripheral	vision	.
We	see	light	 reflect 	 ed 	 	off	the	Moon	.
And	in	the	time	since	Galileo	pointed	that	 rudiment 	 ary 	 	telescope	at	the	celestial	bodies	,	the	known	universe	has	come	to	us	through	light	,	across	vast	eras	in	cosmic	history	.
And	with	all	of	our	modern	 telescope 	 s 	 	,	we	've	been	able	to	collect	this	stunning	silent	movie	of	the	universe	--	these	series	of	 snapshot 	 s 	 	that	go	all	the	way	back	to	the	Big	Bang	.
And	yet	,	the	universe	is	not	a	silent	movie	because	the	universe	is	n't	silent	.
I	'd	like	to	 convinc 	 e 	 	you	that	the	universe	has	a	soundtrack	and	that	soundtrack	is	played	on	space	itself	,	because	space	can	wobble	like	a	drum	.
It	can	ring	out	a	kind	of	recording	throughout	the	universe	of	some	of	the	most	dramatic	events	as	they	unfold	.
Now	we	'd	like	to	be	able	to	add	to	a	kind	of	glorious	visual	composition	that	we	have	of	the	universe	--	a	sonic	composition	.
And	while	we	've	never	heard	the	sounds	from	space	,	we	 re 	 ally 	 	should	,	in	the	next	few	years	,	start	to	turn	up	the	volume	on	what	's	going	on	out	there	.
So	in	this	ambition	to	capture	songs	from	the	universe	,	we	turn	our	focus	to	black	holes	and	the	promise	they	have	,	because	black	holes	can	bang	on	 space 	 - 	 time 	 	like	 mallet 	 s 	 	on	a	drum	and	have	a	very	characteristic	song	,	which	I	'd	like	to	play	for	you	--	some	of	our	 prediction 	 s 	 	for	what	that	song	will	be	like	.
Now	black	holes	are	dark	against	a	dark	sky	.
We	ca	n't	see	them	directly	.
They	're	not	brought	to	us	with	light	,	at	least	not	directly	.
We	can	see	them	 in 	 directly 	 	,	because	black	holes	wreak	havoc	on	their	environment	.
They	destroy	stars	around	them	.
They	churn	up	debris	in	their	 surround 	 ings 	 	.
But	they	wo	n't	come	to	us	directly	through	light	.
We	might	one	day	see	a	shadow	a	black	hole	can	cast	on	a	very	bright	background	,	but	we	have	n't	yet	.
And	yet	black	holes	may	be	heard	even	if	they	're	not	seen	,	and	that	's	because	they	bang	on	 space 	 - 	 time 	 	like	a	drum	.
Now	we	owe	the	idea	that	space	can	ring	like	a	drum	to	Albert	Einstein	--	to	whom	we	owe	so	much	.
Einstein	 re 	 alized 	 	that	if	space	were	empty	,	if	the	universe	were	empty	,	it	would	be	like	this	picture	,	except	for	maybe	without	the	helpful	grid	drawn	on	it	.
But	if	we	were	 free 	 ly 	 	 fall 	 ing 	 	through	the	space	,	even	without	this	helpful	grid	,	we	might	be	able	to	paint	it	 our 	 selves 	 	,	because	we	would	notice	that	we	 travel 	 ed 	 	along	straight	lines	,	 un 	 deflect 	 ed 	 	straight	paths	through	the	universe	.
Einstein	also	 re 	 alized 	 	--	and	this	is	the	real	meat	of	the	matter	--	that	if	you	put	energy	or	mass	in	the	universe	,	it	would	curve	space	,	and	a	 free 	 ly 	 	 fall 	 ing 	 	object	would	pass	by	,	let	's	say	,	the	Sun	and	it	would	be	 deflect 	 ed 	 	along	the	natural	curves	in	the	space	.
It	was	Einstein	's	great	general	theory	of	relativity	.
Now	even	light	will	be	bent	by	those	paths	.
And	you	can	be	bent	so	much	that	you	're	caught	in	orbit	around	the	Sun	,	as	the	Earth	is	,	or	the	Moon	around	the	Earth	.
These	are	the	natural	curves	in	space	.
What	Einstein	did	not	 realiz 	 e 	 	was	that	,	if	you	took	our	Sun	and	you	 crush 	 ed 	 	it	down	to	six	kilometers	--	so	you	took	a	million	times	the	mass	of	the	Earth	and	you	 crush 	 ed 	 	it	to	six	kilometers	across	,	you	would	make	a	black	hole	,	an	object	so	dense	that	if	light	 veer 	 ed 	 	too	close	,	it	would	never	escape	--	a	dark	shadow	against	the	universe	.
It	was	n't	Einstein	who	 re 	 alized 	 	this	,	it	was	Karl	 Schwarz 	 schild 	 	who	was	a	German	Jew	in	World	War	I	--	joined	the	German	army	already	an	 accomplish 	 ed 	 	scientist	,	working	on	the	Russian	front	.
I	like	to	imagine	 Schwarz 	 schild 	 	in	the	war	in	the	 trench 	 es 	 	calculating	ballistic	 trajector 	 ies 	 	for	cannon	fire	,	and	then	,	in	between	,	calculating	Einstein	's	equations	--	as	you	do	in	the	 trench 	 es 	 	.
And	he	was	reading	Einstein	's	 recent 	 ly 	 	published	general	theory	of	relativity	,	and	he	was	 thrill 	 ed 	 	by	this	theory	.
And	he	quickly	 surmise 	 d 	 	an	exact	mathematical	solution	that	described	something	very	 extraordinar 	 y 	 	:	curves	so	strong	that	space	would	rain	down	into	them	,	space	itself	would	curve	like	a	waterfall	flowing	down	the	throat	of	a	hole	.
And	even	light	could	not	escape	this	current	.
Light	would	be	 d 	 ragged 	 	down	the	hole	as	everything	else	would	be	,	and	all	that	would	be	left	would	be	a	shadow	.
Now	he	wrote	to	Einstein	,	and	he	said	,	``	As	you	will	see	,	the	war	has	been	kind	to	me	enough	.
Despite	the	heavy	 gun 	 fire 	 	,	I	've	been	able	to	get	away	from	it	all	and	walk	through	the	land	of	your	ideas	.	''
And	Einstein	was	very	 impress 	 ed 	 	with	his	exact	solution	,	and	I	should	hope	also	the	dedication	of	the	scientist	.
This	is	the	 hard 	 working 	 	scientist	under	harsh	conditions	.
And	he	took	 Schwarz 	 schild 	 	's	idea	to	the	Prussian	Academy	of	Sciences	the	next	week	.
But	Einstein	always	thought	black	holes	were	a	mathematical	oddity	.
He	did	not	believe	they	existed	in	nature	.
He	thought	nature	would	protect	us	from	their	formation	.
It	was	decades	before	the	term	``	black	hole	''	was	 coin 	 ed 	 	and	people	 re 	 alized 	 	that	black	holes	are	real	 astro 	 physical 	 	objects	--	in	fact	they	're	the	death	state	of	very	massive	stars	that	collapse	 catastroph 	 ically 	 	at	the	end	of	their	lifetime	.
Now	our	Sun	will	not	collapse	to	a	black	hole	.
It	's	actually	not	massive	enough	.
But	if	we	did	a	little	thought	experiment	--	as	Einstein	was	very	fond	of	 do 	 ing 	 	--	we	could	imagine	putting	the	Sun	 crush 	 ed 	 	down	to	six	kilometers	,	and	putting	a	tiny	little	Earth	around	it	in	orbit	,	maybe	30	kilometers	outside	of	the	 black 	 - 	 hole 	 	sun	.
And	it	would	be	 self 	 - 	 illuminat 	 ed 	 	,	because	now	the	Sun	's	gone	,	we	have	no	other	source	of	light	--	so	let	's	make	our	little	Earth	 self 	 - 	 illuminat 	 ed 	 	.
And	you	would	 realiz 	 e 	 	you	could	put	the	Earth	in	a	happy	orbit	even	30	km	outside	of	this	 crush 	 ed 	 	black	hole	.
This	 crush 	 ed 	 	black	hole	actually	would	fit	inside	Manhattan	,	more	or	less	.
It	might	spill	off	into	the	Hudson	a	little	bit	before	it	destroyed	the	Earth	.
But	 bas 	 ically 	 	that	's	what	we	're	talking	about	.
We	're	talking	about	an	object	that	you	could	crush	down	to	half	the	square	area	of	Manhattan	.
So	we	move	this	Earth	very	close	--	30	kilometers	outside	--	and	we	notice	it	's	 perfect 	 ly 	 	fine	 orbit 	 ing 	 	around	the	black	hole	.
There	's	a	sort	of	myth	that	black	holes	devour	everything	in	the	universe	,	but	you	actually	have	to	get	very	close	to	fall	in	.
But	what	's	very	 impressiv 	 e 	 	is	that	,	from	our	vantage	point	,	we	can	always	see	the	Earth	.
It	can	not	hide	behind	the	black	hole	.
The	light	from	the	Earth	,	some	of	it	falls	in	,	but	some	of	it	 get 	 s 	 	lensed	around	and	brought	back	to	us	.
So	you	ca	n't	hide	anything	behind	a	black	hole	.
If	this	were	Battlestar	Galactica	and	you	're	fighting	the	 Cylon 	 s 	 	,	do	n't	hide	behind	the	black	hole	.
They	can	see	you	.
Now	,	our	Sun	will	not	collapse	to	a	black	hole	--	it	's	not	massive	enough	--	but	there	are	tens	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	black	holes	in	our	galaxy	.
And	if	one	were	to	eclipse	the	Milky	Way	,	this	is	what	it	would	look	like	.
We	would	see	a	shadow	of	that	black	hole	against	the	hundred	billion	stars	in	the	Milky	Way	Galaxy	and	its	luminous	dust	lanes	.
And	if	we	were	to	fall	towards	this	black	hole	,	we	would	see	all	of	that	light	lensed	around	it	,	and	we	could	even	start	to	cross	into	that	shadow	and	 re 	 ally 	 	not	notice	that	anything	dramatic	had	happened	.
It	would	be	bad	if	we	tried	to	fire	our	rockets	and	get	out	of	there	because	we	could	n't	,	 any 	 more 	 	than	light	can	escape	.
But	even	though	the	black	hole	is	dark	from	the	outside	,	it	's	not	dark	on	the	inside	,	because	all	of	the	light	from	the	galaxy	can	fall	in	behind	us	.
And	even	though	,	due	to	a	relativistic	effect	known	as	time	dilation	,	our	clocks	would	seem	to	slow	down	relative	to	galactic	time	,	it	would	look	as	though	the	evolution	of	the	galaxy	had	been	sped	up	and	shot	at	us	,	right	before	we	were	 crush 	 ed 	 	to	death	by	the	black	hole	.
It	would	be	like	a	 near 	 - 	 death 	 	experience	where	you	see	the	light	at	the	end	of	the	tunnel	,	but	it	's	a	total	death	experience	.
And	there	's	no	way	of	telling	 any 	 body 	 	about	the	light	at	the	end	of	the	tunnel	.
Now	we	've	never	seen	a	shadow	like	this	of	a	black	hole	,	but	black	holes	can	be	heard	,	even	if	they	're	not	seen	.
Imagine	now	taking	an	 astro 	 physical 	 ly 	 	realistic	situation	--	imagine	two	black	holes	that	have	lived	a	long	life	together	.
Maybe	they	started	as	stars	and	 collapse 	 d 	 	to	two	black	holes	--	each	one	10	times	the	mass	of	the	Sun	.
So	now	we	're	going	to	crush	them	down	to	60	kilometers	across	.
They	can	be	spinning	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	times	a	second	.
At	the	end	of	their	lives	,	they	're	going	around	each	other	very	near	the	speed	of	light	.
So	they	're	crossing	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	kilometers	in	a	fraction	of	a	second	,	and	as	they	do	so	,	they	not	only	curve	space	,	but	they	leave	behind	in	their	wake	a	 ring 	 ing 	 	of	space	,	an	actual	wave	on	 space 	 - 	 time 	 	.
Space	 squeeze 	 s 	 	and	 stretch 	 es 	 	as	it	 e 	 man 	 ates 	 	out	from	these	black	holes	 bang 	 ing 	 	on	the	universe	.
And	they	travel	out	into	the	cosmos	at	the	speed	of	light	.
This	computer	simulation	is	due	to	a	relativity	group	at	NASA	Goddard	.
It	took	almost	30	years	for	 any 	 one 	 	in	the	world	to	crack	this	problem	.
This	was	one	of	the	groups	.
It	shows	two	black	holes	in	orbit	around	each	other	,	again	,	with	these	 helpful 	 ly 	 	painted	curves	.
And	if	you	can	see	--	it	's	kind	of	faint	--	but	if	you	can	see	the	red	waves	 e 	 man 	 ating 	 	out	,	those	are	the	gravitational	waves	.
They	're	literally	the	sounds	of	space	 ring 	 ing 	 	,	and	they	will	travel	out	from	these	black	holes	at	the	speed	of	light	as	they	ring	down	and	coalesce	to	one	spinning	,	quiet	black	hole	at	the	end	of	the	day	.
If	you	were	standing	near	enough	,	your	ear	would	 resonat 	 e 	 	with	the	 squeezin 	 g 	 	and	 stretch 	 ing 	 	of	space	.
You	would	literally	hear	the	sound	.
Now	of	course	,	your	head	would	be	 s 	 queezed 	 	and	stretched	 un 	 helpful 	 ly 	 	,	so	you	might	have	trouble	understanding	what	's	going	on	.
But	I	'd	like	to	play	for	you	the	sound	that	we	predict	.
This	is	from	my	group	--	a	 s 	 lightly 	 	less	glamorous	computer	modeling	.
Imagine	a	lighter	black	hole	 fall 	 ing 	 	into	a	very	heavy	black	hole	.
The	sound	you	're	hearing	is	the	light	black	hole	 bang 	 ing 	 	on	space	each	time	it	 get 	 s 	 	close	.
If	it	 get 	 s 	 	far	away	,	it	's	a	little	too	quiet	.
But	it	comes	in	like	a	mallet	,	and	it	literally	cracks	space	,	 wobb 	 ling 	 	it	like	a	drum	.
And	we	can	predict	what	the	sound	will	be	.
We	know	that	,	as	it	falls	in	,	it	 get 	 s 	 	faster	and	it	 get 	 s 	 	louder	.
And	 eventual 	 ly 	 	,	we	're	going	to	hear	the	little	guy	just	fall	into	the	 bigg 	 er 	 	guy	.
Then	it	's	gone	.
Now	I	've	never	heard	it	that	loud	--	it	's	actually	more	dramatic	.
At	home	it	sounds	kind	of	 anti 	 climactic 	 	.
It	's	sort	of	like	ding	,	ding	,	ding	.
This	is	another	sound	from	my	group	.
No	,	I	'm	not	showing	you	any	images	,	because	black	holes	do	n't	leave	behind	helpful	trails	of	ink	,	and	space	is	not	painted	,	showing	you	the	curves	.
But	if	you	were	to	float	by	in	space	on	a	space	holiday	and	you	heard	this	,	you	want	to	get	moving	.
Want	to	get	away	from	the	sound	.
Both	black	holes	are	moving	.
Both	black	holes	are	getting	closer	together	.
In	this	case	,	they	're	both	 wobb 	 ling 	 	quite	a	lot	.
And	then	they	're	going	to	merge	.
Now	it	's	gone	.
Now	that	chirp	is	very	characteristic	of	black	holes	merging	--	that	it	 chirp 	 s 	 	up	at	the	end	.
Now	that	's	our	prediction	for	what	we	'll	see	.
 Luck 	 ily 	 	we	're	at	this	safe	distance	in	Long	Beach	,	California	.
And	 sure 	 ly 	 	,	 s 	 omewhere 	 	in	the	universe	two	black	holes	have	merged	.
And	 sure 	 ly 	 	,	the	space	around	us	is	 ring 	 ing 	 	after	 travel 	 ing 	 	maybe	a	million	light	years	,	or	a	million	years	,	at	the	speed	of	light	to	get	to	us	.
But	the	sound	is	too	quiet	for	any	of	us	to	ever	hear	.
There	are	very	 industri 	 ous 	 	 experiment 	 s 	 	being	built	on	Earth	--	one	called	LIGO	--	which	will	detect	 deviation 	 s 	 	in	the	 squeezin 	 g 	 	and	 stretch 	 ing 	 	of	space	at	less	than	the	fraction	of	a	nucleus	of	an	atom	over	four	kilometers	.
It	's	a	 remarkabl 	 y 	 	ambitious	experiment	,	and	it	's	going	to	be	at	advanced	sensitivity	within	the	next	few	years	--	to	pick	this	up	.
There	's	also	a	mission	proposed	for	space	,	which	 hopeful 	 ly 	 	will	launch	in	the	next	ten	years	,	called	LISA	.
And	LISA	will	be	able	to	see	 super 	 - 	 massive 	 	black	holes	--	black	holes	 million 	 s 	 	or	 billion 	 s 	 	of	times	the	mass	of	the	Sun	.
In	this	Hubble	image	,	we	see	two	galaxies	.
They	look	like	they	're	frozen	in	some	embrace	.
And	each	one	probably	 harbor 	 s 	 	a	 super 	 - 	 massive 	 	black	hole	at	its	core	.
But	they	're	not	frozen	;	they	're	actually	merging	.
These	two	black	holes	are	 colli 	 ding 	 	,	and	they	will	merge	over	a	 billion 	 - 	 year 	 	time	scale	.
It	's	beyond	our	human	perception	to	pick	up	a	song	of	that	duration	.
But	LISA	could	see	the	final	stages	of	two	 super 	 - 	 massive 	 	black	holes	earlier	in	the	universe	's	history	,	the	last	15	minutes	before	they	fall	together	.
And	it	's	not	just	black	holes	,	but	it	's	also	any	big	disturbance	in	the	universe	--	and	the	biggest	of	them	all	is	the	Big	Bang	.
When	that	expression	was	 coin 	 ed 	 	,	it	was	 deris 	 ive 	 	--	like	,	``	Oh	,	who	would	believe	in	a	Big	Bang	?	''
But	now	it	actually	might	be	more	 technical 	 ly 	 	accurate	because	it	might	bang	.
It	might	make	a	sound	.
This	animation	from	my	friends	at	 Pro 	 ton 	 	Studios	shows	looking	at	the	Big	Bang	from	the	outside	.
We	do	n't	ever	want	to	do	that	actually	.	We	want	to	be	inside	the	universe	because	there	's	no	such	thing	as	standing	outside	the	universe	.
So	imagine	you	're	inside	the	Big	Bang	.
It	's	everywhere	,	it	's	all	around	you	,	and	the	space	is	 wobb 	 ling 	 	 chaotic 	 ally 	 	.
Fourteen	billion	years	pass	and	this	song	is	still	 ring 	 ing 	 	all	around	us	.
 Galaxie 	 s 	 	form	,	and	 generation 	 s 	 	of	stars	form	in	those	galaxies	,	and	around	one	star	,	at	least	one	star	,	is	a	 habit 	 able 	 	planet	.
And	here	we	are	 fran 	 tically 	 	building	these	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	 do 	 ing 	 	these	 calculation 	 s 	 	,	writing	these	computer	codes	.
Imagine	a	billion	years	ago	,	two	black	holes	 collide 	 d 	 	.
That	song	has	been	 ring 	 ing 	 	through	space	for	all	that	time	.
We	were	n't	even	here	.
It	 get 	 s 	 	closer	and	closer	--	40,000	years	ago	,	we	're	still	 do 	 ing 	 	cave	paintings	.
It	's	like	hurry	,	build	your	instruments	.
It	's	getting	closer	and	closer	,	and	in	20	...
whatever	year	it	will	be	when	our	detectors	are	finally	at	advanced	sensitivity	--	we	'll	build	them	,	we	'll	turn	on	the	machines	and	,	bang	,	we	'll	catch	it	--	the	first	song	from	space	.
If	it	was	the	Big	Bang	we	were	going	to	pick	up	,	it	would	sound	like	this	.
It	's	a	terrible	sound	.
It	's	literally	the	definition	of	noise	.
It	's	white	noise	;	it	's	such	a	chaotic	 ring 	 ing 	 	.
But	it	's	around	us	everywhere	,	 presum 	 ably 	 	,	if	it	has	n't	been	wiped	out	by	some	other	process	in	the	universe	.
And	if	we	pick	it	up	,	it	will	be	music	to	our	ears	because	it	will	be	the	quiet	echo	of	that	moment	of	our	creation	,	of	our	observable	universe	.
So	within	the	next	few	years	,	we	'll	be	able	to	turn	up	the	soundtrack	a	little	bit	,	render	the	universe	in	audio	.
But	if	we	detect	those	 earl 	 iest 	 	 moment 	 s 	 	,	it	'll	bring	us	that	much	closer	to	an	understanding	of	the	Big	Bang	,	which	 bring 	 s 	 	us	that	much	closer	to	 as 	 king 	 	some	of	the	 hard 	 est 	 	,	most	elusive	,	questions	.
If	we	run	the	movie	of	our	universe	 backward 	 s 	 	,	we	know	that	there	was	a	Big	Bang	in	our	past	,	and	we	might	even	hear	the	 cacoph 	 onous 	 	sound	of	it	,	but	was	our	Big	Bang	the	only	Big	Bang	?
I	mean	we	have	to	ask	,	has	it	happened	before	?
Will	it	happen	again	?
I	mean	,	in	the	spirit	of	rising	to	TED	's	challenge	to	 reign 	 ite 	 	wonder	,	we	can	ask	questions	,	at	least	for	this	last	minute	,	that	 honest 	 ly 	 	might	 eva 	 de 	 	us	forever	.
But	we	have	to	ask	:	Is	it	possible	that	our	universe	is	just	a	plume	off	of	some	greater	history	?
Or	,	is	it	possible	that	we	're	just	a	branch	off	of	a	 multi 	 verse 	 	--	each	branch	with	its	own	Big	Bang	in	its	past	--	maybe	some	of	them	with	black	holes	playing	drums	,	maybe	some	without	--	maybe	some	with	sentient	life	,	and	maybe	some	without	--	not	in	our	past	,	not	in	our	future	,	but	 some 	 how 	 	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	connected	to	us	?
So	we	have	to	wonder	,	if	there	is	a	 multi 	 verse 	 	,	in	some	other	patch	of	that	 multi 	 verse 	 	,	are	there	creatures	?
Here	's	my	 multi 	 verse 	 	creatures	.
Are	there	other	creatures	in	the	 multi 	 verse 	 	,	 wonder 	 ing 	 	about	us	and	 wonder 	 ing 	 	about	their	own	origins	?
And	if	they	are	,	I	can	imagine	them	as	we	are	,	calculating	,	writing	computer	code	,	building	instruments	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	detect	that	 fain 	 test 	 	sound	of	their	origins	and	 wonder 	 ing 	 	who	else	is	out	there	.
Thank	you	.	Thank	you	.

Nalini	 Nad 	 karni 	 	:	Life	science	in	prison
Trees	 epitomiz 	 e 	 	stasis	.
Trees	are	 root 	 ed 	 	in	the	ground	in	one	place	for	many	human	 generation 	 s 	 	,	but	if	we	shift	our	perspective	from	the	trunk	to	the	 twig 	 s 	 	,	trees	become	very	dynamic	entities	,	moving	and	growing	.
And	I	decided	to	explore	this	movement	by	turning	trees	into	artists	.
I	simply	tied	the	end	of	a	 paint 	 brush 	 	onto	a	twig	.
I	waited	for	the	wind	to	come	up	and	held	up	a	canvas	,	and	that	produced	art	.
The	piece	of	art	you	see	on	your	left	is	painted	by	a	western	red	cedar	and	that	on	your	right	by	a	Douglas	fir	,	and	what	I	learned	was	that	different	species	have	different	 signature 	 s 	 	,	like	a	Picasso	versus	a	Monet	.
But	I	was	also	interested	in	the	movement	of	trees	and	how	this	art	might	let	me	capture	that	and	 quant 	 ify 	 	it	,	so	to	measure	the	distance	that	a	single	vine	maple	tree	--	which	produced	this	painting	--	moved	in	a	single	year	,	I	simply	measured	and	summed	each	of	those	lines	.
I	 multipli 	 ed 	 	them	by	the	number	of	 twig 	 s 	 	per	branch	and	the	number	of	branches	per	tree	and	then	divided	that	by	the	number	of	minutes	per	year	.
And	so	I	was	able	to	calculate	how	far	a	single	tree	moved	in	a	single	year	.
You	might	have	a	guess	.
The	answer	is	actually	186,540	miles	,	or	seven	times	around	the	globe	.
And	so	simply	by	shifting	our	perspective	from	a	single	trunk	to	the	many	dynamic	 twig 	 s 	 	,	we	are	able	to	see	that	trees	are	not	simply	static	entities	,	but	rather	 extreme 	 ly 	 	dynamic	.
And	I	began	to	think	about	ways	that	we	might	consider	this	lesson	of	trees	,	to	consider	other	entities	that	are	also	static	and	stuck	,	but	which	cry	for	change	and	 dynamic 	 ism 	 	,	and	one	of	those	entities	is	our	 prison 	 s 	 	.
 Prison 	 s 	 	,	of	course	,	are	where	people	who	break	our	laws	are	stuck	,	confined	behind	bars	.
And	our	prison	system	itself	is	stuck	.
The	United	States	has	over	2.3	million	 incarcerate 	 d 	 	men	and	women	.
That	number	is	rising	.
Of	the	100	 incarcerate 	 d 	 	people	that	are	released	,	60	will	return	to	prison	.
Funds	for	education	,	for	training	and	for	rehabilitation	are	 declin 	 ing 	 	,	so	this	 despair 	 ing 	 	cycle	of	incarceration	continues	.
I	decided	to	ask	whether	the	lesson	I	had	learned	from	trees	as	artists	could	be	 a 	 pplied 	 	to	a	static	institution	such	as	our	 prison 	 s 	 	,	and	I	think	the	answer	is	yes	.
In	the	year	2007	,	I	started	a	partnership	with	the	Washington	State	Department	of	 Correction 	 s 	 	.
Working	with	four	 prison 	 s 	 	,	we	began	bringing	science	and	scientists	,	sustainability	and	conservation	projects	to	four	state	 prison 	 s 	 	.
We	give	science	lectures	,	and	the	men	here	are	 choos 	 ing 	 	to	come	to	our	science	lectures	instead	of	watching	television	or	 weight 	 lifting 	 	.
That	,	I	think	,	is	movement	.
We	 partner 	 ed 	 	with	the	Nature	 Conservanc 	 y 	 	for	 in 	 mates 	 	at	Stafford	Creek	 Correction 	 al 	 	Center	to	grow	 endanger 	 ed 	 	prairie	plants	for	restoration	of	relic	prairie	areas	in	Washington	state	.
That	,	I	think	,	is	movement	.
We	worked	with	the	Washington	State	Department	of	Fish	and	Wildlife	to	grow	 endanger 	 ed 	 	frogs	--	the	Oregon	spotted	frog	--	for	later	release	into	protected	wetlands	.
That	,	I	think	,	is	movement	.
And	just	 recent 	 ly 	 	,	we	've	begun	to	work	with	those	men	who	are	segregated	in	what	we	call	 Super 	 max 	 	facilities	.
They	've	 in 	 curred 	 	violent	 infra 	 ctions 	 	by	becoming	violent	with	guards	and	with	other	prisoners	.
They	're	kept	in	bare	cells	like	this	for	23	hours	a	day	.
When	they	have	meetings	with	their	review	boards	or	mental	health	professionals	,	they	're	placed	in	 im 	 mobile 	 	 booth 	 s 	 	like	this	.
For	one	hour	a	day	they	're	brought	to	these	bleak	and	bland	exercise	yards	.
Although	we	ca	n't	bring	trees	and	prairie	plants	and	frogs	into	these	 environment 	 s 	 	,	we	are	bringing	images	of	nature	into	these	exercise	yards	,	putting	them	on	the	walls	,	so	at	least	they	get	contact	with	visual	images	of	nature	.
This	is	Mr.	Lopez	,	who	has	been	in	 sol 	 itary 	 	confinement	for	18	months	,	and	he	's	providing	input	on	the	types	of	images	that	he	 believe 	 s 	 	would	make	him	and	his	fellow	 in 	 mates 	 	more	 seren 	 e 	 	,	more	calm	,	less	apt	to	violence	.
And	so	what	we	see	,	I	think	,	is	that	small	,	collective	movements	of	change	can	 perhap 	 s 	 	move	an	entity	such	as	our	own	prison	system	in	a	direction	of	hope	.
We	know	that	trees	are	static	entities	when	we	look	at	their	 trunk 	 s 	 	.
But	if	trees	can	create	art	,	if	they	can	encircle	the	globe	seven	times	in	one	year	,	if	prisoners	can	grow	plants	and	raise	frogs	,	then	 perhap 	 s 	 	there	are	other	static	entities	that	we	hold	inside	 our 	 selves 	 	,	like	grief	,	like	 addiction 	 s 	 	,	like	racism	,	that	can	also	change	.
Thank	you	very	much	.

Swami	 Dayanand 	 a 	 	Saraswati	:	The	profound	journey	of	compassion
A	human	child	is	born	,	and	for	quite	a	long	time	is	a	consumer	.
It	can	not	be	 conscious 	 ly 	 	a	contributor	.
It	is	 help 	 less 	 	.
It	does	n't	know	how	to	survive	,	even	though	it	is	endowed	with	an	instinct	to	survive	.
It	needs	the	help	of	mother	,	or	a	foster	mother	,	to	survive	.
It	ca	n't	afford	to	doubt	the	person	who	 tend 	 s 	 	the	child	.
It	has	to	totally	surrender	,	as	one	 surrender 	 s 	 	to	an	 anesthesi 	 ologist 	 	.
It	has	to	totally	surrender	.
That	 impli 	 es 	 	a	lot	of	trust	.
That	 impli 	 es 	 	the	trusted	person	wo	n't	 violat 	 e 	 	the	trust	.
As	the	child	 grow 	 s 	 	,	it	begins	to	discover	that	the	person	trusted	is	 violat 	 ing 	 	the	trust	.
It	does	n't	know	even	the	word	``	violation	.	''
Therefore	,	it	has	to	blame	itself	,	a	 word 	 less 	 	blame	,	which	is	more	difficult	to	 re 	 ally 	 	resolve	--	the	 word 	 less 	 	 self 	 - 	 blame 	 	.
As	the	child	 grow 	 s 	 	to	become	an	adult	:	so	far	,	it	has	been	a	consumer	,	but	the	growth	of	a	human	being	lies	in	his	or	her	capacity	to	 contribut 	 e 	 	,	to	be	a	contributor	.
One	can	not	 contribut 	 e 	 	 un 	 less 	 	one	 feel 	 s 	 	secure	,	one	 feel 	 s 	 	big	,	one	 feel 	 s 	 	:	I	have	enough	.
To	be	 compassion 	 ate 	 	is	not	a	joke	.
It	's	not	that	simple	.
One	has	to	discover	a	certain	 big 	 ness 	 	in	 one 	 self 	 	.
That	 big 	 ness 	 	should	be	centered	on	 one 	 self 	 	,	not	in	terms	of	money	,	not	in	terms	of	power	you	wield	,	not	in	terms	of	any	status	that	you	can	command	in	the	society	,	but	it	should	be	centered	on	 one 	 self 	 	.
The	self	:	you	are	 self 	 - 	 aware 	 	.
On	that	self	,	it	should	be	centered	--	a	 big 	 ness 	 	,	a	 whole 	 ness 	 	.
Otherwise	,	compassion	is	just	a	word	and	a	dream	.
You	can	be	 compassion 	 ate 	 	 occasion 	 ally 	 	,	more	moved	by	empathy	than	by	compassion	.
Thank	God	we	are	 em 	 pathetic 	 	.
When	 some 	 body 	 	's	in	pain	,	we	pick	up	the	pain	.
In	a	Wimbledon	final	match	,	these	two	guys	fight	it	out	.
Each	one	has	got	two	games	.
It	can	be	 any 	 body 	 	's	game	.
What	they	have	 sweat 	 ed 	 	so	far	has	no	meaning	.
One	person	wins	.
The	tennis	etiquette	is	,	both	the	players	have	to	come	to	the	net	and	shake	hands	.
The	winner	boxes	the	air	and	 kiss 	 es 	 	the	ground	,	throws	his	shirt	as	though	 some 	 body 	 	is	waiting	for	it	.
And	this	guy	has	to	come	to	the	net	.
When	he	comes	to	the	net	,	you	see	,	his	whole	face	changes	.
It	looks	as	though	he	's	 wish 	 ing 	 	that	he	did	n't	win	.
Why	?	 Empath 	 y 	 	.
That	's	human	heart	.
No	human	heart	is	denied	of	that	empathy	.
No	religion	can	demolish	that	by	 indoctri 	 nation 	 	.
No	culture	,	no	nation	and	nationalism	--	nothing	can	touch	it	because	it	is	empathy	.
And	that	capacity	to	 empath 	 ize 	 	is	the	window	through	which	you	reach	out	to	people	,	you	do	something	that	makes	a	difference	in	 some 	 body 	 	's	life	--	even	words	,	even	time	.
Compassion	is	not	defined	in	one	form	.
There	's	no	Indian	compassion	.
There	's	no	American	compassion	.
It	 transcend 	 s 	 	nation	,	the	gender	,	the	age	.
Why	?	Because	it	is	there	in	everybody	.
It	's	 experience 	 d 	 	by	people	 occasion 	 ally 	 	.
Then	this	 occasion 	 al 	 	compassion	,	we	are	not	talking	about	--	it	will	never	remain	 occasion 	 al 	 	.
By	mandate	,	you	can	not	make	a	person	 compassion 	 ate 	 	.
You	ca	n't	say	,	``	Please	love	me	.	''
Love	is	something	you	discover	.
It	's	not	an	action	,	but	in	the	English	language	,	it	is	also	an	action	.
I	will	come	to	it	later	.
So	one	has	got	to	discover	a	certain	 whole 	 ness 	 	.
I	am	going	to	cite	the	possibility	of	being	whole	,	which	is	within	our	experience	,	everybody	's	experience	.
In	spite	of	a	very	tragic	life	,	one	is	happy	in	 moment 	 s 	 	which	are	very	few	and	far	between	.
And	the	one	who	is	happy	,	even	for	a	 slap 	 stick 	 	joke	,	 accept 	 s 	 	himself	and	also	the	scheme	of	things	in	which	one	finds	 one 	 self 	 	.
That	means	the	whole	universe	,	known	things	and	unknown	things	.
All	of	them	are	totally	accepted	because	you	discover	your	 whole 	 ness 	 	in	yourself	.
The	subject	--	``	me	''	--	and	the	object	--	the	scheme	of	things	--	fuse	into	 one 	 ness 	 	,	an	experience	nobody	can	say	,	``	I	am	denied	of	,	''	an	experience	common	to	all	and	 sund 	 ry 	 	.
That	experience	 confirm 	 s 	 	that	,	in	spite	of	all	your	 limitation 	 s 	 	--	all	your	 want 	 s 	 	,	 desire 	 s 	 	,	 un 	 fulfill 	 ed 	 	,	and	the	credit	cards	and	 layoff 	 s 	 	and	,	finally	,	 bald 	 ness 	 	--	you	can	be	happy	.
But	the	extension	of	the	logic	is	that	you	do	n't	need	to	fulfill	your	desire	to	be	happy	.
You	are	the	very	happiness	,	the	 whole 	 ness 	 	that	you	want	to	be	.
There	's	no	choice	in	this	:	that	only	 confirm 	 s 	 	the	reality	that	the	 whole 	 ness 	 	can	not	be	different	from	you	,	can	not	be	minus	you	.
It	has	got	to	be	you	.
You	can	not	be	a	part	of	 whole 	 ness 	 	and	still	be	whole	.
Your	moment	of	happiness	 reveal 	 s 	 	that	reality	,	that	 re 	 alization 	 	,	that	recognition	:	``	Maybe	I	am	the	whole	.
Maybe	the	swami	is	right	.
Maybe	the	swami	is	right	.	''	You	start	your	new	life	.
Then	everything	becomes	 meaning 	 ful 	 	.
I	have	no	more	reason	to	blame	myself	.
If	one	has	to	blame	 one 	 self 	 	,	one	has	a	million	reasons	plus	many	.
But	if	I	say	,	in	spite	of	my	body	being	limited	--	if	it	is	black	it	is	not	white	,	if	it	is	white	it	is	not	black	:	body	is	limited	any	which	way	you	look	at	it	.	Limited	.
Your	knowledge	is	limited	,	health	is	limited	,	and	power	is	therefore	limited	,	and	the	 cheerful 	 ness 	 	is	going	to	be	limited	.
Compassion	is	going	to	be	limited	.
Everything	is	going	to	be	 limit 	 less 	 	.
You	can	not	command	compassion	 un 	 less 	 	you	become	 limit 	 less 	 	,	and	nobody	can	become	 limit 	 less 	 	,	either	you	are	or	you	are	not	.	Period	.
And	there	is	no	way	of	your	being	not	 limit 	 less 	 	too	.
Your	own	experience	 reveal 	 s 	 	,	in	spite	of	all	 limitation 	 s 	 	,	you	are	the	whole	.
And	the	 whole 	 ness 	 	is	the	reality	of	you	when	you	relate	to	the	world	.
It	is	love	first	.
When	you	relate	to	the	world	,	the	dynamic	 manifest 	 ation 	 	of	the	 whole 	 ness 	 	is	,	what	we	say	,	love	.
And	itself	becomes	compassion	if	the	object	that	you	relate	to	 e 	 vokes 	 	that	emotion	.
Then	that	again	 transform 	 s 	 	into	giving	,	into	sharing	.
You	express	yourself	because	you	have	compassion	.
To	discover	compassion	,	you	need	to	be	 compassion 	 ate 	 	.
To	discover	the	capacity	to	give	and	share	,	you	need	to	be	giving	and	sharing	.
There	is	no	shortcut	:	it	is	like	swimming	by	swimming	.
You	learn	swimming	by	swimming	.
You	can	not	learn	swimming	on	a	foam	 mat 	 tress 	 	and	enter	into	water	.
You	learn	swimming	by	swimming	.	You	learn	cycling	by	cycling	.
You	learn	cooking	by	cooking	,	having	some	sympathetic	people	around	you	to	eat	what	you	cook	.
And	,	therefore	,	what	I	say	,	you	have	to	fake	it	and	make	it	.
You	need	to	.
My	predecessor	meant	that	.
You	have	to	act	it	out	.
You	have	to	act	 compassion 	 ately 	 	.
There	is	no	verb	for	compassion	,	but	you	have	an	adverb	for	compassion	.
That	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	to	me	.
You	act	 compassion 	 ately 	 	.
But	then	,	how	to	act	 compassion 	 ately 	 	if	you	do	n't	have	compassion	?
That	is	where	you	fake	.
You	fake	it	and	make	it	.	This	is	the	mantra	of	the	United	States	of	America	.
You	fake	it	and	make	it	.
You	act	 compassion 	 ately 	 	as	though	you	have	compassion	:	grind	your	teeth	,	take	all	the	support	system	.
If	you	know	how	to	pray	,	pray	.
Ask	for	compassion	.
Let	me	act	 compassion 	 ately 	 	.
Do	it	.
You	'll	discover	compassion	and	also	 slow 	 ly 	 	a	relative	compassion	,	and	 slow 	 ly 	 	,	 perhap 	 s 	 	if	you	get	the	right	teaching	,	you	'll	discover	compassion	is	a	dynamic	 manifest 	 ation 	 	of	the	reality	of	yourself	,	which	is	 one 	 ness 	 	,	 whole 	 ness 	 	,	and	that	's	what	you	are	.
With	these	words	,	thank	you	very	much	.

Shirin	 Nesha 	 t 	 	:	Art	in	exile
The	story	I	wanted	to	share	with	you	today	is	my	challenge	as	an	Iranian	artist	,	as	an	Iranian	woman	artist	,	as	an	Iranian	woman	artist	living	in	exile	.
Well	,	it	has	its	 plus 	 es 	 	and	 minus 	 es 	 	.
On	the	dark	side	,	politics	does	n't	seem	to	escape	people	like	me	.
Every	Iranian	artist	,	in	one	form	or	another	,	is	political	.
Politics	have	defined	our	lives	.
If	you	're	living	in	Iran	,	you	're	facing	censorship	,	harassment	,	arrest	,	torture	--	at	times	,	execution	.
If	you	're	living	outside	like	me	,	you	're	faced	with	life	in	exile	--	the	pain	of	the	 long 	 ing 	 	and	the	separation	from	your	loved	ones	and	your	family	.
Therefore	,	we	do	n't	find	the	moral	,	emotional	,	psychological	and	political	space	to	distance	 our 	 selves 	 	from	the	reality	of	social	responsibility	.
 Odd 	 ly 	 	enough	,	an	artist	such	as	myself	finds	herself	also	in	the	position	of	being	the	voice	,	the	speaker	of	my	people	,	even	if	I	have	,	 inde 	 ed 	 	,	no	access	to	my	own	country	.
Also	,	people	like	myself	,	we	're	fighting	two	battles	on	different	grounds	.
We	're	being	critical	of	the	West	,	the	perception	of	the	West	about	our	identity	--	about	the	image	that	is	constructed	about	us	,	about	our	women	,	about	our	politics	,	about	our	religion	.
We	are	there	to	take	pride	and	insist	on	respect	.
And	at	the	same	time	,	we	're	fighting	another	battle	.
That	is	our	regime	,	our	government	--	our	 a 	 trocious 	 	government	,	[	that	]	has	done	every	crime	in	order	to	stay	in	power	.
Our	artists	are	at	risk	.
We	are	in	a	position	of	danger	.
We	pose	a	threat	to	the	order	of	the	government	.
But	 iron 	 ically 	 	,	this	situation	has	 empower 	 ed 	 	all	of	us	,	because	we	are	considered	,	as	artists	,	central	to	the	cultural	,	political	,	social	discourse	in	Iran	.
We	are	there	to	inspire	,	to	 provok 	 e 	 	,	to	mobilize	,	to	bring	hope	to	our	people	.
We	are	the	 reporter 	 s 	 	of	our	people	,	and	are	 communicator 	 s 	 	to	the	outside	world	.
Art	is	our	weapon	.
Culture	is	a	form	of	resistance	.
I	envy	sometimes	the	artists	of	the	West	for	their	freedom	of	expression	.
For	the	fact	that	they	can	distance	themselves	from	the	question	of	politics	.
From	the	fact	that	they	are	only	serving	one	audience	,	mainly	the	Western	culture	.
But	also	,	I	worry	about	the	West	,	because	often	in	this	country	,	in	this	Western	world	that	we	have	,	culture	risks	being	a	form	of	entertainment	.
Our	people	depend	on	our	artists	,	and	culture	is	beyond	communication	.
My	journey	as	an	artist	started	from	a	very	,	very	personal	place	.
I	did	not	start	to	make	social	commentary	about	my	country	.
The	first	one	that	you	see	in	front	of	you	is	actually	when	I	first	returned	to	Iran	after	being	separated	for	a	good	12	years	.
It	was	after	the	Islamic	Revolution	of	1979	.
While	I	was	absent	from	Iran	,	the	Islamic	Revolution	had	 descend 	 ed 	 	on	Iran	and	had	 entire 	 ly 	 	transformed	the	country	from	Persian	to	the	Islamic	culture	.
I	came	mainly	to	be	 re 	 united 	 	with	my	family	and	to	 re 	 connect 	 	in	a	way	that	I	found	my	place	in	the	society	.
But	instead	,	I	found	a	country	that	was	totally	 ide 	 ological 	 	and	that	I	did	n't	 recogniz 	 e 	 	 any 	 more 	 	.
More	so	,	I	became	very	interested	,	as	I	was	facing	my	own	personal	 dilemma 	 s 	 	and	questions	,	I	became	 immers 	 ed 	 	in	the	study	of	the	Islamic	Revolution	--	how	,	 inde 	 ed 	 	,	it	had	 incredibl 	 y 	 	transformed	the	lives	of	Iranian	women	.
I	found	the	subject	of	Iranian	women	in	the	way	the	women	of	Iran	,	 historical 	 ly 	 	,	 see 	 med 	 	to	embody	the	political	transformation	.
So	in	a	way	,	by	 study 	 ing 	 	a	woman	,	you	can	read	the	structure	and	the	ideology	of	the	country	.
So	I	made	a	group	of	work	that	at	once	faced	my	own	personal	questions	in	life	,	and	yet	it	brought	my	work	into	a	larger	discourse	--	the	subject	of	 martyr 	 dom 	 	,	the	question	of	those	who	 will 	 ingly 	 	stand	in	that	intersection	of	love	of	God	,	faith	,	but	violence	and	crime	and	cruelty	.
For	me	,	this	became	 incredibl 	 y 	 	important	.
And	yet	,	I	had	an	unusual	position	toward	this	.
I	was	an	 outside 	 r 	 	who	had	come	back	to	Iran	to	find	my	place	,	but	I	was	not	in	a	position	to	be	critical	of	the	government	or	the	ideology	of	the	Islamic	Revolution	.
This	changed	 slow 	 ly 	 	as	I	found	my	voice	and	I	discovered	things	that	I	did	n't	know	I	would	discover	.
So	my	art	became	 s 	 lightly 	 	more	critical	.
My	knife	became	a	little	 sharp 	 er 	 	.
And	I	fell	into	a	life	in	exile	.
I	am	a	nomadic	artist	.
I	work	in	Morocco	,	in	Turkey	,	in	Mexico	.
I	go	everywhere	to	make	believe	it	's	Iran	.
Now	I	am	making	films	.
Last	year	,	I	finished	a	film	called	``	Women	Without	Men	.	''
``	Women	Without	Men	''	returns	to	history	,	but	another	part	of	our	Iranian	history	.
It	goes	to	1953	when	American	CIA	 exercise 	 d 	 	a	coup	and	removed	a	 democratic 	 ally 	 	elected	leader	,	The	book	is	written	by	an	Iranian	woman	,	 Shahr 	 nush 	 	 Parsi 	 pur 	 	.
It	's	a	magical	realist	novel	.
This	book	is	banned	,	and	she	spent	five	years	in	prison	.
My	obsession	with	this	book	,	and	the	reason	I	made	this	into	a	film	,	is	because	it	at	once	was	 address 	 ing 	 	the	question	of	being	a	female	--	 traditional 	 ly 	 	,	 historical 	 ly 	 	in	Iran	--	and	the	question	of	four	women	who	are	all	looking	for	an	idea	of	change	,	freedom	and	democracy	--	while	the	country	of	Iran	,	 e 	 qually 	 	,	as	if	another	character	,	also	 struggle 	 d 	 	for	an	idea	of	freedom	and	democracy	and	independence	from	the	foreign	 intervention 	 s 	 	.
I	made	this	film	because	I	felt	it	's	important	for	it	to	speak	to	the	 Western 	 ers 	 	about	our	history	as	a	country	.
That	all	of	you	seem	to	remember	Iran	after	the	Islamic	Revolution	.
That	Iran	was	once	a	secular	society	,	and	we	had	democracy	,	and	this	democracy	was	stolen	from	us	by	the	American	government	,	by	the	British	government	.
This	film	also	 speak 	 s 	 	to	the	Iranian	people	in	 as 	 king 	 	them	to	return	to	their	history	and	look	at	themselves	before	they	were	so	 Islamic 	 ized 	 	--	in	the	way	we	looked	,	in	the	way	we	played	music	,	in	the	way	we	had	intellectual	life	.
And	most	of	all	,	in	the	way	that	we	fought	for	democracy	.
These	are	some	of	the	shots	actually	from	my	film	.
These	are	some	of	the	images	of	the	coup	.
And	we	made	this	film	in	Casablanca	,	 re 	 creating 	 	all	the	shots	.
This	film	tried	to	find	a	balance	between	telling	a	political	story	,	but	also	a	feminine	story	.
Being	a	visual	artist	,	 inde 	 ed 	 	,	I	am	 fore 	 most 	 	interested	to	make	art	--	to	make	art	that	 transcend 	 s 	 	politics	,	religion	,	the	question	of	feminism	,	and	become	an	important	,	 time 	 less 	 	,	universal	work	of	art	.
The	challenge	I	have	is	how	to	do	that	.
How	to	tell	a	political	story	but	an	 allegoric 	 al 	 	story	.
How	to	move	you	with	your	emotions	,	but	also	make	your	mind	work	.
These	are	some	of	the	images	and	the	characters	of	the	film	.
Now	comes	the	green	movement	--	the	summer	of	2009	,	as	my	film	is	released	--	the	uprising	begins	in	the	streets	of	Tehran	.
What	is	 un 	 believably 	 	ironic	is	the	period	that	we	tried	to	depict	in	the	film	,	the	cry	for	democracy	and	social	justice	,	 repeat 	 s 	 	itself	now	again	in	Tehran	.
The	green	movement	 s 	 ignificantly 	 	inspired	the	world	.
It	brought	a	lot	of	attention	to	all	those	 Iranian 	 s 	 	who	stand	for	basic	human	rights	and	struggle	for	democracy	.
What	was	most	significant	for	me	was	,	once	again	,	the	presence	of	the	women	.
They	're	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 inspiration 	 al 	 	for	me	.
If	in	the	Islamic	Revolution	,	the	images	of	the	woman	 portray 	 ed 	 	were	submissive	and	did	n't	have	a	voice	,	now	we	saw	a	new	idea	of	feminism	in	the	streets	of	Tehran	--	women	who	were	educated	,	forward	thinking	,	 non 	 - 	 traditional 	 	,	 sexual 	 ly 	 	open	,	fearless	and	 serious 	 ly 	 	feminist	.
These	women	and	those	young	men	united	 Iranian 	 s 	 	across	the	world	,	inside	and	outside	.
I	then	discovered	why	I	take	so	much	inspiration	from	Iranian	women	.
That	,	under	all	 circumstance 	 s 	 	,	they	have	 push 	 ed 	 	the	boundary	.
They	have	 confront 	 ed 	 	the	authority	.
They	have	broken	every	rule	in	the	smallest	and	the	biggest	way	.
And	once	again	,	they	proved	themselves	.
I	stand	here	to	say	that	Iranian	women	have	found	a	new	voice	,	and	their	voice	is	giving	me	my	voice	.
And	it	's	a	great	honor	to	be	an	Iranian	woman	and	an	Iranian	artist	,	even	if	I	have	to	operate	in	the	West	only	for	now	.
Thank	you	so	much	.

Oliver	 Sack 	 s 	 	:	What	hallucination	 reveal 	 s 	 	about	our	minds
We	see	with	the	eyes	,	but	we	see	with	the	brain	as	well	.
And	seeing	with	the	brain	is	often	called	imagination	.
And	we	are	familiar	with	the	 landscape 	 s 	 	of	our	own	imagination	,	our	 in 	 scapes 	 	.	We	've	lived	with	them	all	our	lives	.
But	there	are	also	 hallucination 	 s 	 	as	well	,	and	 hallucination 	 s 	 	are	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	.
They	do	n't	seem	to	be	of	our	creation	.
They	do	n't	seem	to	be	under	our	control	.
They	seem	to	come	from	the	outside	,	and	to	mimic	perception	.
So	I	am	going	to	be	talking	about	 hallucination 	 s 	 	,	and	a	particular	sort	of	visual	hallucination	which	I	see	among	my	patients	.
A	few	months	ago	,	I	got	a	phone	call	from	a	nursing	home	where	I	work	.
They	told	me	that	one	of	their	residents	,	an	old	lady	in	her	90s	,	was	seeing	things	,	and	they	 wonder 	 ed 	 	if	she	'd	gone	 bon 	 kers 	 	or	,	because	she	was	an	old	lady	,	whether	she	'd	had	a	stroke	,	or	whether	she	had	Alzheimer	's	.
And	so	they	asked	me	if	I	would	come	and	see	Rosalie	,	the	old	lady	.
I	went	in	to	see	her	.
It	was	evident	straight	away	that	she	was	 perfect 	 ly 	 	sane	and	lucid	and	of	good	intelligence	,	but	she	'd	been	very	 start 	 led 	 	and	very	 bewilder 	 ed 	 	,	because	she	'd	been	seeing	things	.
And	she	told	me	--	the	nurses	had	n't	mentioned	this	--	that	she	was	blind	,	that	she	had	been	 complete 	 ly 	 	blind	from	macular	degeneration	for	five	years	.
But	now	,	for	the	last	few	days	,	she	'd	been	seeing	things	.
So	I	said	,	``	What	sort	of	things	?	''
And	she	said	,	``	People	in	Eastern	dress	,	in	 drape 	 s 	 	,	walking	up	and	down	stairs	.
A	man	who	turns	towards	me	and	 s 	 miles 	 	.
But	he	has	huge	teeth	on	one	side	of	his	mouth	.
Animals	too	.
I	see	a	white	building	.	It	's	 snow 	 ing 	 	,	a	soft	snow	.
I	see	this	horse	with	a	harness	,	 d 	 ragging 	 	the	snow	away	.
Then	,	one	night	,	the	scene	changes	.
I	see	cats	and	dogs	walking	towards	me	.
They	come	to	a	certain	point	and	then	stop	.
Then	it	changes	again	.
I	see	a	lot	of	children	.	They	are	walking	up	and	down	stairs	.
They	wear	bright	colors	,	rose	and	blue	,	like	Eastern	dress	.	''
Sometimes	,	she	said	,	before	the	people	come	on	,	she	may	 hallucin 	 ate 	 	pink	and	blue	 square 	 s 	 	on	the	floor	,	which	seem	to	go	up	to	the	ceiling	.
I	said	,	``	Is	this	like	a	dream	?	''
And	she	said	,	``	No	,	it	's	not	like	a	dream	.	It	's	like	a	movie	.	''
She	said	,	``	It	's	got	color	.	It	's	got	motion	.
But	it	's	 complete 	 ly 	 	silent	,	like	a	silent	movie	.	''
And	she	said	that	it	's	a	rather	boring	movie	.
She	said	,	``	All	these	people	with	Eastern	dress	,	walking	up	and	down	,	very	 re 	 petitive 	 	,	very	limited	.	''
And	she	has	a	sense	of	humor	.
She	knew	it	was	a	hallucination	.
But	she	was	 frighten 	 ed 	 	.	She	'd	lived	95	years	and	she	'd	never	had	a	hallucination	before	.
She	said	that	the	 hallucination 	 s 	 	were	 un 	 related 	 	to	anything	she	was	thinking	or	feeling	or	 do 	 ing 	 	,	that	they	 see 	 med 	 	to	come	on	by	themselves	,	or	disappear	.
She	had	no	control	over	them	.
She	said	she	did	n't	 recogniz 	 e 	 	any	of	the	people	or	places	in	the	 hallucination 	 s 	 	.
And	none	of	the	people	or	the	animals	,	well	,	they	all	 see 	 med 	 	oblivious	of	her	.
And	she	did	n't	know	what	was	going	on	.
She	 wonder 	 ed 	 	if	she	was	going	mad	or	losing	her	mind	.
Well	,	I	examined	her	 care 	 fully 	 	.
She	was	a	bright	old	lady	,	 perfect 	 ly 	 	sane	.	She	had	no	medical	problems	.
She	was	n't	on	any	 medication 	 s 	 	which	could	produce	 hallucination 	 s 	 	.
But	she	was	blind	.
And	I	then	said	to	her	,	``	I	think	I	know	what	you	have	.	''
I	said	,	``	There	is	a	special	form	of	visual	hallucination	which	may	go	with	 deteriora 	 ting 	 	vision	or	blindness	.
This	was	 original 	 ly 	 	described	,	''	I	said	,	``	right	back	in	the	18th	century	,	by	a	man	called	Charles	Bonnet	.
And	you	have	Charles	Bonnet	syndrome	.
There	is	nothing	wrong	with	your	brain	.	There	is	nothing	wrong	with	your	mind	.
You	have	Charles	Bonnet	syndrome	.	''
And	she	was	very	relieved	at	this	,	that	there	was	nothing	 serious 	 ly 	 	the	matter	,	and	also	rather	curious	.
She	said	,	``	Who	is	this	Charles	Bonnet	?	''
She	said	,	``	Did	he	have	them	himself	?	''
And	she	said	,	``	Tell	all	the	nurses	that	I	have	Charles	Bonnet	syndrome	.	''
``	I	'm	not	crazy	.	I	'm	not	 de 	 mented 	 	.	I	have	Charles	Bonnet	syndrome	.	''
Well	,	so	I	did	tell	the	nurses	.
Now	this	,	for	me	,	is	a	common	situation	.
I	work	in	 old 	 - 	 age 	 	homes	,	 large 	 ly 	 	.
I	see	a	lot	of	elderly	people	who	are	hearing	 impair 	 ed 	 	or	 visual 	 ly 	 	 impair 	 ed 	 	.
About	10	percent	of	the	hearing	 impair 	 ed 	 	people	get	musical	 hallucination 	 s 	 	.
And	about	10	percent	of	the	 visual 	 ly 	 	 impair 	 ed 	 	people	get	visual	 hallucination 	 s 	 	.
You	do	n't	have	to	be	 complete 	 ly 	 	blind	,	only	 sufficient 	 ly 	 	 impair 	 ed 	 	.
Now	with	the	original	description	in	the	18th	century	,	Charles	Bonnet	did	not	have	them	.
His	grandfather	had	these	 hallucination 	 s 	 	.
His	grandfather	was	a	magistrate	,	an	elderly	man	.
He	'd	had	cataract	surgery	.
His	vision	was	pretty	poor	.
And	in	1759	,	he	described	to	his	grandson	various	things	he	was	seeing	.
The	first	thing	he	said	was	he	saw	a	 hand 	 kerchief 	 	in	 mid 	 air 	 	.
It	was	a	large	blue	 hand 	 kerchief 	 	with	four	orange	circles	.
And	he	knew	it	was	a	hallucination	.
You	do	n't	have	 hand 	 kerchief 	 s 	 	in	 mid 	 air 	 	.
And	then	he	saw	a	big	wheel	in	 mid 	 air 	 	.
But	sometimes	he	was	n't	sure	whether	he	was	 hallucin 	 ating 	 	or	not	,	because	the	 hallucination 	 s 	 	would	fit	in	the	context	of	the	visions	.
So	on	one	occasion	,	when	his	 grand 	 daughters 	 	were	 visit 	 ing 	 	them	,	he	said	,	``	And	who	are	these	handsome	young	men	with	you	?	''
And	they	said	,	``	Alas	,	 Grand 	 papa 	 	,	there	are	no	handsome	young	men	.	''
And	then	the	handsome	young	men	 disappear 	 ed 	 	.
It	's	typical	of	these	 hallucination 	 s 	 	that	they	may	come	in	a	flash	and	disappear	in	a	flash	.
They	do	n't	usually	fade	in	and	out	.
They	are	rather	sudden	,	and	they	change	 sudden 	 ly 	 	.
Charles	 L 	 ullin 	 	,	the	grandfather	,	saw	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	different	figures	,	different	 landscape 	 s 	 	of	all	 sort 	 s 	 	.
On	one	occasion	,	he	saw	a	man	in	a	 bath 	 robe 	 	smoking	a	pipe	,	and	 re 	 alized 	 	it	was	himself	.
That	was	the	only	figure	he	recognized	.
On	one	occasion	when	he	was	walking	in	the	streets	of	Paris	,	he	saw	--	this	was	real	--	a	 scaffold 	 ing 	 	.
But	when	he	got	back	home	,	he	saw	a	miniature	of	the	 scaffold 	 ing 	 	six	inches	high	,	on	his	study	table	.
This	 re 	 petition 	 	of	perception	is	sometimes	called	 palin 	 opsia 	 	.
With	him	and	with	Rosalie	,	what	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	going	on	--	and	Rosalie	said	,	``	What	's	going	on	?	''	--	and	I	said	that	as	you	lose	vision	,	as	the	visual	parts	of	the	brain	are	no	 long 	 er 	 	getting	any	input	,	they	become	 hyper 	 active 	 	and	excitable	,	and	they	start	to	fire	 spontaneous 	 ly 	 	.
And	you	start	to	see	things	.
The	things	you	see	can	be	very	complicated	 inde 	 ed 	 	.
With	another	patient	of	mine	,	who	,	also	had	some	vision	,	the	vision	she	had	could	be	 disturb 	 ing 	 	.
On	one	occasion	,	she	said	she	saw	a	man	in	a	striped	shirt	in	a	restaurant	.
And	he	turned	around	.	And	then	he	divided	into	six	figures	in	striped	shirts	,	who	started	walking	towards	her	.
And	then	the	six	figures	came	together	again	,	like	a	 concert 	 ina 	 	.
Once	,	when	she	was	driving	,	or	rather	,	her	husband	was	driving	,	the	road	divided	into	four	and	she	felt	herself	going	 simultaneous 	 ly 	 	up	four	roads	.
She	had	very	mobile	 hallucination 	 s 	 	as	well	.
A	lot	of	them	had	to	do	with	a	car	.
Sometimes	she	would	see	a	teenage	boy	sitting	on	the	hood	of	the	car	.
He	was	very	 ten 	 acious 	 	and	he	moved	rather	 graceful 	 ly 	 	when	the	car	turned	.
And	then	when	they	came	to	a	stop	,	the	boy	would	do	a	sudden	vertical	takeoff	,	100	foot	in	the	air	,	and	then	disappear	.
Another	patient	of	mine	had	a	different	sort	of	hallucination	.
This	was	a	woman	who	did	n't	have	trouble	with	her	eyes	,	but	the	visual	parts	of	her	brain	,	a	little	tumor	in	the	occipital	cortex	.
And	,	above	all	,	she	would	see	cartoons	.
These	cartoons	would	be	transparent	and	would	cover	half	the	visual	field	,	like	a	screen	.
And	especially	she	saw	cartoons	of	Kermit	the	Frog	.
Now	,	I	do	n't	watch	Sesame	Street	,	but	she	made	a	point	of	saying	,	``	Why	Kermit	?	''	She	said	,	``	Kermit	the	Frog	means	nothing	to	me	.
You	know	,	I	was	 wonder 	 ing 	 	about	Freudian	 determinant 	 s 	 	.
Why	Kermit	?
Kermit	the	Frog	means	nothing	to	me	.	''
She	did	n't	mind	the	cartoons	too	much	.
But	what	did	disturb	her	was	she	got	very	persistent	images	or	 hallucination 	 s 	 	of	faces	and	as	with	Rosalie	,	the	faces	were	often	deformed	,	with	very	large	teeth	or	very	large	eyes	.
And	these	 frighten 	 ed 	 	her	.
Well	,	what	is	going	on	with	these	people	?
As	a	physician	,	I	have	to	try	and	define	what	's	going	on	,	and	to	 reassur 	 e 	 	people	,	especially	to	 reassur 	 e 	 	them	that	they	're	not	going	insane	.
Something	like	10	percent	,	as	I	said	,	of	 visual 	 ly 	 	 impair 	 ed 	 	people	get	these	.
But	no	more	than	one	percent	of	the	people	 acknowledg 	 e 	 	them	,	because	they	are	afraid	they	will	be	seen	as	insane	or	something	.
And	if	they	do	mention	them	to	their	own	doctors	they	may	be	 mis 	 diagnosed 	 	.
In	particular	,	the	notion	is	that	if	you	see	things	or	hear	things	,	you	're	going	mad	,	but	the	psychotic	 hallucination 	 s 	 	are	quite	different	.
 Psycho 	 tic 	 	 hallucination 	 s 	 	,	whether	they	are	visual	or	vocal	,	they	address	you	.	They	accuse	you	.
They	 seduc 	 e 	 	you	.	They	 humili 	 ate 	 	you	.
They	 je 	 er 	 	at	you	.
You	interact	with	them	.
There	is	none	of	this	quality	of	being	 address 	 ed 	 	with	these	Charles	Bonnet	 hallucination 	 s 	 	.
There	is	a	film	.	You	're	seeing	a	film	which	has	nothing	to	do	with	you	,	or	that	's	how	people	think	about	it	.
There	is	also	a	rare	thing	called	temporal	lobe	epilepsy	,	and	sometimes	,	if	one	has	this	,	one	may	feel	 one 	 self 	 	 transport 	 ed 	 	back	to	a	time	and	place	in	the	past	.
You	're	at	a	particular	road	junction	.
You	smell	 chestnut 	 s 	 	 roast 	 ing 	 	.
You	hear	the	traffic	.	All	the	senses	are	involved	.
And	you	're	waiting	for	your	girl	.
And	it	's	that	Tuesday	evening	back	in	1982	.
And	the	temporal	lobe	 hallucination 	 s 	 	are	 all 	 - 	 sense 	 	 hallucination 	 s 	 	,	full	of	feeling	,	full	of	 familiar 	 ity 	 	,	located	in	space	and	time	,	coherent	,	dramatic	.
The	Charles	Bonnet	ones	are	quite	different	.
So	in	the	Charles	Bonnet	 hallucination 	 s 	 	,	you	have	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	levels	,	from	the	 geometric 	 al 	 	 hallucination 	 s 	 	--	the	pink	and	blue	 square 	 s 	 	the	woman	had	--	up	to	quite	 elaborat 	 e 	 	 hallucination 	 s 	 	with	figures	and	especially	faces	.
Faces	,	and	sometimes	deformed	faces	,	are	the	single	 common 	 est 	 	thing	in	these	 hallucination 	 s 	 	.
And	one	of	the	second	 common 	 est 	 	is	cartoons	.
So	,	what	is	going	on	?
 Fascina 	 tingly 	 	,	in	the	last	few	years	,	it	's	been	possible	to	do	functional	brain	imagery	,	to	do	fMRI	on	people	as	they	are	 hallucin 	 ating 	 	.
And	in	fact	,	to	find	that	different	parts	of	the	visual	brain	are	activated	as	they	are	 hallucin 	 ating 	 	.
When	people	have	these	simple	 geometric 	 al 	 	 hallucination 	 s 	 	,	the	primary	visual	cortex	is	activated	.
This	is	the	part	of	the	brain	which	 perceiv 	 es 	 	edges	and	patterns	.
You	do	n't	form	images	with	your	primary	visual	cortex	.
When	images	are	formed	,	a	higher	part	of	the	visual	cortex	is	involved	in	the	temporal	lobe	.
And	in	particular	,	one	area	of	the	temporal	lobe	is	called	the	fusiform	gyrus	.
And	it	's	known	that	if	people	have	damage	in	the	fusiform	gyrus	,	they	maybe	lose	the	ability	to	 recogniz 	 e 	 	faces	.
But	if	there	is	an	abnormal	activity	in	the	fusiform	gyrus	,	they	may	 hallucin 	 ate 	 	faces	,	and	this	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	you	find	in	some	of	these	people	.
There	is	an	area	in	the	anterior	part	of	this	gyrus	where	teeth	and	eyes	are	represented	,	and	that	part	of	the	gyrus	is	activated	when	people	get	the	deformed	 hallucination 	 s 	 	.
There	is	another	part	of	the	brain	which	is	especially	activated	when	one	 see 	 s 	 	cartoons	.
It	's	activated	when	one	 recogniz 	 es 	 	cartoons	,	when	one	draws	cartoons	,	and	when	one	 hallucin 	 ates 	 	them	.
It	's	very	 interest 	 ing 	 	that	that	should	be	specific	.
There	are	other	parts	of	the	brain	which	are	 s 	 pecifically 	 	involved	with	the	recognition	and	hallucination	of	buildings	and	 landscape 	 s 	 	.
Around	1970	,	it	was	found	that	there	were	not	only	parts	of	the	brain	,	but	particular	cells	.
``	Face	cells	''	were	discovered	around	1970	.
And	now	we	know	that	there	are	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	other	 sort 	 s 	 	of	cells	,	which	can	be	very	,	very	specific	.
So	you	may	not	only	have	``	car	''	cells	,	you	may	have	``	Aston	Martin	''	cells	.
I	saw	an	Aston	Martin	this	morning	.
I	had	to	bring	it	in	.
And	now	it	's	in	there	 s 	 omewhere 	 	.
Now	,	at	this	level	,	in	what	's	called	the	 infero 	 temporal 	 	cortex	,	there	are	only	visual	images	,	or	 fig 	 ments 	 	or	 fragment 	 s 	 	.
It	's	only	at	higher	levels	that	the	other	senses	join	in	and	there	are	connections	with	memory	and	emotion	.
And	in	the	Charles	Bonnet	syndrome	,	you	do	n't	go	to	those	higher	levels	.
You	're	in	these	levels	of	inferior	visual	cortex	where	you	have	 thousand 	 s 	 	and	tens	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	and	 million 	 s 	 	of	images	,	or	 fig 	 ments 	 	,	or	 fragment 	 ary 	 	 fig 	 ments 	 	,	all	 neural 	 ly 	 	encoded	in	particular	cells	or	small	 cluster 	 s 	 	of	cells	.
Normally	these	are	all	part	of	the	integrated	stream	of	perception	,	or	imagination	,	and	one	is	not	conscious	of	them	.
It	is	only	if	one	is	 visual 	 ly 	 	 impair 	 ed 	 	or	blind	that	the	process	is	 interrupt 	 ed 	 	.
And	instead	of	getting	normal	perception	,	you	're	getting	an	anarchic	,	convulsive	stimulation	,	or	release	,	of	all	of	these	visual	cells	in	the	 infero 	 temporal 	 	cortex	.
So	,	 sudden 	 ly 	 	you	see	a	face	.	Suddenly	you	see	a	car	.
Suddenly	this	,	and	 sudden 	 ly 	 	that	.
The	mind	does	its	best	to	organize	and	to	give	some	sort	of	coherence	to	this	,	but	not	 terri 	 bly 	 	 successful 	 ly 	 	.
When	these	were	first	described	,	it	was	thought	that	they	could	be	 interpret 	 ed 	 	like	dreams	.
But	in	fact	people	say	,	``	I	do	n't	 recogniz 	 e 	 	the	people	.	I	ca	n't	form	any	 association 	 s 	 	.	''
``	Kermit	means	nothing	to	me	.	''
You	do	n't	get	anywhere	thinking	of	them	as	dreams	.
Well	,	I	've	more	or	less	said	what	I	wanted	.
I	think	I	just	want	to	 re 	 capitula 	 te 	 	and	say	this	is	common	.
Think	of	the	number	of	blind	people	.
There	must	be	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	blind	people	who	have	these	 hallucination 	 s 	 	,	but	are	too	scared	to	mention	them	.
So	this	sort	of	thing	needs	to	be	brought	into	notice	,	for	patients	,	for	doctors	,	for	the	public	.
Finally	,	I	think	they	are	 in 	 finitely 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	and	valuable	,	for	giving	one	some	insight	as	to	how	the	brain	works	.
Charles	Bonnet	said	,	250	years	ago	--	he	 wonder 	 ed 	 	how	,	thinking	these	 hallucination 	 s 	 	,	how	,	as	he	put	it	,	the	theater	of	the	mind	could	be	generated	by	the	machinery	of	the	brain	.
Now	,	250	years	later	,	I	think	we	're	beginning	to	 glimps 	 e 	 	how	this	is	done	.
Thanks	very	much	.
Chris	Anderson	:	That	was	 super 	 b 	 	.	Thank	you	so	much	.
You	speak	about	these	things	with	so	much	insight	and	empathy	for	your	patients	.
Have	you	yourself	 experience 	 d 	 	any	of	the	 syndrome 	 s 	 	you	write	about	?
Oliver	 Sack 	 s 	 	:	I	was	afraid	you	'd	ask	that	.
Well	,	yeah	,	a	lot	of	them	.
And	actually	I	'm	a	little	 visual 	 ly 	 	 impair 	 ed 	 	myself	.
I	'm	blind	in	one	eye	,	and	not	 terri 	 bly 	 	good	in	the	other	.
And	I	see	the	 geometric 	 al 	 	 hallucination 	 s 	 	.
But	they	stop	there	.
CA	:	And	they	do	n't	disturb	you	?
Because	you	understand	what	's	 do 	 ing 	 	it	,	it	does	n't	make	you	worried	?
OS	:	Well	they	do	n't	disturb	me	any	more	than	my	tinnitus	,	which	I	ignore	.
They	 occasion 	 ally 	 	interest	me	,	and	I	have	many	pictures	of	them	in	my	 notebook 	 s 	 	.
I	've	gone	and	had	an	fMRI	myself	,	to	see	how	my	visual	cortex	is	taking	over	.
And	when	I	see	all	these	 hexagon 	 s 	 	and	complex	things	,	which	I	also	have	,	in	visual	migraine	,	I	wonder	whether	everyone	 see 	 s 	 	things	like	this	,	and	whether	things	like	cave	art	or	ornamental	art	may	have	been	derived	from	them	a	bit	.
CA	:	That	was	an	 utter 	 ly 	 	,	 utter 	 ly 	 	 fascina 	 ting 	 	talk	.
Thank	you	so	much	for	sharing	.
OS	:	Thank	you	.	Thank	you	.

Salman	Khan	talks	about	how	and	why	he	created	the	 remarkabl 	 e 	 	Khan	Academy	,	a	 care 	 fully 	 	structured	series	of	educational	videos	offering	complete	curricula	in	math	and	,	now	,	other	subjects	.	He	shows	the	power	of	 i 	 nteractive 	 	 exercise 	 s 	 	,	and	calls	for	teachers	to	consider	flipping	the	traditional	classroom	script	--	give	students	video	lectures	to	watch	at	home	,	and	do	``	 home 	 work 	 	''	in	the	classroom	with	the	teacher	available	to	help	.
 Talk 	 s 	 
1090
Salman	Khan	:	Let	's	use	video	to	 re 	 invent 	 	education
The	Khan	Academy	is	most	known	for	its	collection	of	videos	,	so	before	I	go	any	further	,	let	me	show	you	a	little	bit	of	a	montage	.
Salman	Khan	:	So	the	hypotenuse	is	now	going	to	be	five	.
This	animal	's	fossils	are	only	found	in	this	area	of	South	America	--	a	nice	clean	band	here	--	and	this	part	of	Africa	.
We	can	integrate	over	the	surface	,	and	the	notation	usually	is	a	capital	sigma	.
National	Assembly	:	They	create	the	Committee	of	Public	Safety	,	which	sounds	like	a	very	nice	committee	.
Notice	,	this	is	an	aldehyde	,	and	it	's	an	alcohol	.
Start	differentiating	into	 effect 	 or 	 	and	memory	cells	.
A	galaxy	.	Hey	,	there	's	another	galaxy	.
Oh	look	,	there	's	another	galaxy	.
And	for	dollars	,	is	their	30	million	,	plus	the	20	million	dollars	from	the	American	manufacturer	.
If	this	does	not	blow	your	mind	,	then	you	have	no	emotion	.
SK	:	We	now	have	on	the	order	of	2,200	videos	covering	everything	from	basic	arithmetic	all	the	way	to	vector	calculus	and	some	of	the	stuff	you	saw	there	.
We	have	a	million	students	a	month	 us 	 ing 	 	the	site	,	watching	on	the	order	of	100	to	200,000	videos	a	day	.
But	what	we	're	going	to	talk	about	in	this	is	how	we	're	going	to	the	next	level	.
But	before	I	do	that	,	I	want	to	talk	a	little	bit	about	 re 	 ally 	 	just	how	I	got	started	.
And	some	of	you	all	might	know	,	about	five	years	ago	I	was	an	analyst	at	a	hedge	fund	,	and	I	was	in	Boston	,	and	I	was	 tutor 	 ing 	 	my	 cousin 	 s 	 	in	New	Orleans	,	 remote 	 ly 	 	.
And	I	started	putting	the	first	YouTube	videos	up	 re 	 ally 	 	just	as	a	kind	of	 nice 	 - 	 to 	 - 	 have 	 	,	just	a	supplement	for	my	 cousin 	 s 	 	--	something	that	might	give	them	a	 refresh 	 er 	 	or	something	.
And	as	soon	as	I	put	those	first	YouTube	videos	up	,	something	 interest 	 ing 	 	happened	--	actually	a	bunch	of	 interest 	 ing 	 	things	happened	.
The	first	was	the	feedback	from	my	 cousin 	 s 	 	.
They	told	me	that	they	preferred	me	on	YouTube	than	in	person	.
And	once	you	get	over	the	 back 	 handed 	 	nature	of	that	,	there	was	actually	something	very	profound	there	.
They	were	saying	that	they	preferred	the	 automat 	 ed 	 	version	of	their	cousin	to	their	cousin	.
At	first	,	it	's	very	 un 	 intuitive 	 	,	but	when	you	actually	think	about	it	from	their	point	of	view	,	it	makes	a	ton	of	sense	.
You	have	this	situation	where	now	they	can	pause	and	repeat	their	cousin	,	without	feeling	like	they	're	 was 	 ting 	 	my	time	.
If	they	have	to	review	something	that	they	should	have	learned	a	couple	of	weeks	ago	,	or	maybe	a	couple	of	years	ago	,	they	do	n't	have	to	be	 embarrass 	 ed 	 	and	ask	their	cousin	.
They	can	just	watch	those	videos	.	If	they	're	bored	,	they	can	go	 a 	 head 	 	.
They	can	watch	it	at	their	own	time	,	at	their	own	pace	.
And	probably	the	least	appreciated	aspect	of	this	is	the	notion	that	the	very	first	time	,	the	very	first	time	that	you	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	your	brain	around	a	new	concept	,	the	very	last	thing	you	need	is	another	human	being	saying	,	``	Do	you	understand	this	?	''
And	that	's	what	was	happening	with	the	interaction	with	my	 cousin 	 s 	 	before	,	and	now	they	can	just	do	it	in	the	intimacy	of	their	own	room	.
The	other	thing	that	happened	is	--	I	put	them	on	YouTube	just	--	I	saw	no	reason	to	make	it	private	,	so	I	let	other	people	watch	it	,	and	then	people	started	 s 	 tumbling 	 	on	it	,	and	I	started	getting	some	comments	and	some	letters	and	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	feedback	from	random	people	from	around	the	world	.
And	these	are	just	a	few	.
This	is	actually	from	one	of	the	original	calculus	videos	.
And	someone	wrote	just	on	YouTube	--	it	was	a	YouTube	comment	:	``	First	time	I	 smile 	 d 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	a	derivative	.	''
And	let	's	pause	here	.
This	person	did	a	derivative	and	then	they	 smile 	 d 	 	.
And	then	in	a	response	to	that	same	comment	--	this	is	on	the	thread	.
You	can	go	on	YouTube	and	look	at	these	comments	--	someone	else	wrote	:	``	Same	thing	here	.
I	actually	got	a	natural	high	and	a	good	mood	for	the	entire	day	.
Since	I	remember	seeing	all	of	this	matrix	text	in	class	,	and	here	I	'm	all	like	,	'I	know	kung	fu	.	'	''	And	we	get	a	lot	of	feedback	all	along	those	lines	.
This	 clear 	 ly 	 	was	 help 	 ing 	 	people	.
But	then	,	as	the	 view 	 ership 	 	kept	growing	and	kept	growing	,	I	started	getting	letters	from	people	,	and	it	was	starting	to	become	clear	that	it	was	actually	more	than	just	a	 nice 	 - 	 to 	 - 	 have 	 	.
This	is	just	an	excerpt	from	one	of	those	letters	.
``	My	12	 year 	 - 	 old 	 	son	has	autism	and	has	had	a	terrible	time	with	math	.
We	have	tried	everything	,	viewed	everything	,	bought	everything	.
We	 s 	 tumble 	 d 	 	on	your	video	on	 decimal 	 s 	 	and	it	got	through	.
Then	we	went	on	to	the	 dread 	 ed 	 	 fraction 	 s 	 	.	Again	,	he	got	it	.
We	could	not	believe	it	.
He	is	so	excited	.	''
And	so	you	can	imagine	,	here	I	was	an	analyst	at	a	hedge	fund	.
It	was	very	strange	for	me	to	do	something	of	social	value	.
But	I	was	excited	,	so	I	kept	going	.
And	then	a	few	other	things	started	to	dawn	on	me	.
That	,	not	only	would	it	help	my	 cousin 	 s 	 	right	now	,	or	these	people	who	are	 s 	 ending 	 	letters	,	but	that	this	content	will	never	go	old	,	that	it	could	help	their	kids	or	their	 grand 	 kids 	 	.
If	Isaac	Newton	had	done	YouTube	videos	on	calculus	,	I	would	n't	have	to	.
Assuming	he	was	good	.	We	do	n't	know	.
The	other	thing	that	happened	--	and	even	at	this	point	,	I	said	,	``	Okay	,	maybe	it	's	a	good	supplement	.
It	's	good	for	motivated	students	.
It	's	good	for	maybe	home	 school 	 ers 	 	.	''
But	I	did	n't	think	it	would	be	something	that	would	 some 	 how 	 	penetrate	the	classroom	.
But	then	I	started	getting	letters	from	teachers	.
And	the	teachers	would	write	,	saying	,	``	We	've	used	your	videos	to	flip	the	classroom	.
You	've	given	the	lectures	,	so	now	what	we	do	...	``	--	and	this	could	happen	in	every	classroom	in	America	tomorrow	--	``	...	what	I	do	is	I	assign	the	lectures	for	 home 	 work 	 	,	and	what	used	to	be	 home 	 work 	 	,	I	now	have	the	students	 do 	 ing 	 	in	the	classroom	.	''
And	I	want	to	pause	here	for	--	I	want	to	pause	here	for	a	second	,	because	there	's	a	couple	of	 interest 	 ing 	 	things	.
One	,	when	those	teachers	are	 do 	 ing 	 	that	,	there	's	the	obvious	benefit	--	the	benefit	that	now	their	students	can	enjoy	the	videos	in	the	way	that	my	 cousin 	 s 	 	did	.
They	can	pause	,	repeat	at	their	own	pace	,	at	their	own	time	.
But	the	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	thing	is	--	and	this	is	the	 un 	 intuitive 	 	thing	when	you	talk	about	technology	in	the	classroom	--	by	 re 	 moving 	 	the	 one 	 - 	 size 	 - 	 fits 	 - 	 all 	 	lecture	from	the	classroom	and	letting	students	have	a	 self 	 - 	 paced 	 	lecture	at	home	,	and	then	when	you	go	to	the	classroom	,	letting	them	do	work	,	having	the	teacher	walk	around	,	having	the	peers	actually	be	able	to	interact	with	each	other	,	these	teachers	have	used	technology	to	humanize	the	classroom	.
They	took	a	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	 de 	 humanizing 	 	experience	--	30	kids	with	their	fingers	on	their	lips	,	not	allowed	to	interact	with	each	other	.
A	teacher	,	no	matter	how	good	,	has	to	give	this	 one 	 - 	 size 	 - 	 fits 	 - 	 all 	 	lecture	to	30	students	--	blank	faces	,	 s 	 lightly 	 	 antagonist 	 ic 	 	--	and	now	it	's	a	human	experience	.
Now	they	're	actually	 interact 	 ing 	 	with	each	other	.
So	once	the	Khan	Academy	--	I	quit	my	job	and	we	turned	into	a	real	organization	--	we	're	a	 not 	 - 	 for 	 - 	 profit 	 	--	the	question	is	,	how	do	we	take	this	to	the	next	level	?
How	do	we	take	what	those	teachers	are	 do 	 ing 	 	to	their	natural	conclusion	?
And	so	what	I	'm	showing	you	over	here	,	these	are	actual	 exercise 	 s 	 	that	I	started	writing	for	my	 cousin 	 s 	 	.
The	ones	I	started	were	much	more	primitive	.
This	is	a	more	competent	version	of	it	.
But	the	paradigm	here	is	,	we	'll	generate	as	many	questions	as	you	need	until	you	get	that	concept	,	until	you	get	10	in	a	row	.
And	the	Khan	Academy	videos	are	there	.
You	get	 hint 	 s 	 	,	the	actual	steps	for	that	problem	,	if	you	do	n't	know	how	to	do	it	.
But	the	paradigm	here	,	it	 seem 	 s 	 	like	a	very	simple	thing	:	10	in	a	row	,	you	move	on	.
But	it	's	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	different	than	what	's	happening	in	 classroom 	 s 	 	right	now	.
In	a	traditional	classroom	,	you	have	a	couple	of	 home 	 work 	 	,	 home 	 work 	 	,	lecture	,	 home 	 work 	 	,	lecture	,	and	then	you	have	a	snapshot	exam	.
And	that	exam	,	whether	you	get	a	70	percent	,	an	80	percent	,	a	90	percent	or	a	95	percent	,	the	class	moves	on	to	the	next	topic	.
And	even	that	95	percent	student	,	what	was	the	five	percent	they	did	n't	know	?
Maybe	they	did	n't	know	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	you	raise	something	to	the	zero	power	.
And	then	you	go	build	on	that	in	the	next	concept	.
That	's	 ana 	 logous 	 	to	imagine	learning	to	ride	a	bicycle	,	and	maybe	I	give	you	a	lecture	 a 	 head 	 	of	time	,	and	I	give	you	that	bicycle	for	two	weeks	.
And	then	I	come	back	after	two	weeks	,	and	I	say	,	``	Well	,	let	's	see	.	You	're	having	trouble	taking	left	turns	.
You	ca	n't	quite	stop	.
You	're	an	80	percent	 bi 	 cyclist 	 	.	''
So	I	put	a	big	C	stamp	on	your	forehead	and	then	I	say	,	``	Here	's	a	unicycle	.	''
But	as	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	as	that	sounds	,	that	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	's	happening	in	our	 classroom 	 s 	 	right	now	.
And	the	idea	is	you	fast	forward	and	good	students	start	failing	algebra	all	of	a	sudden	and	start	failing	calculus	all	of	a	sudden	,	 despit 	 e 	 	being	smart	,	 despit 	 e 	 	having	good	teachers	,	and	it	's	usually	because	they	have	these	Swiss	cheese	gaps	that	kept	building	throughout	their	foundation	.
So	our	model	is	learn	math	the	way	you	'd	learn	anything	,	like	the	way	you	would	learn	a	bicycle	.
Stay	on	that	bicycle	.	Fall	off	that	bicycle	.
Do	it	as	long	as	necessary	until	you	have	 master 	 y 	 	.
The	traditional	model	,	it	 penalize 	 s 	 	you	for	 experiment 	 ation 	 	and	failure	,	but	it	does	not	expect	 master 	 y 	 	.
We	encourage	you	to	experiment	.	We	encourage	you	to	failure	.
But	we	do	expect	 master 	 y 	 	.
This	is	just	another	one	of	the	modules	.
This	is	 trigono 	 metry 	 	.
This	is	shifting	and	reflecting	functions	.
And	they	all	fit	together	.
We	have	about	90	of	these	right	now	.
And	you	can	go	to	the	site	right	now	.	It	's	all	free	.	Not	 try 	 ing 	 	to	sell	anything	.
But	the	general	idea	is	that	they	all	fit	into	this	knowledge	map	.
That	top	node	right	there	,	that	's	literally	single	digit	addition	.
It	's	like	one	plus	one	is	equal	to	two	.
And	the	paradigm	is	,	once	you	get	10	in	a	row	on	that	,	it	keeps	 forward 	 ing 	 	you	to	more	and	more	advanced	modules	.
So	if	you	keep	further	down	the	knowledge	map	,	we	're	getting	into	more	advanced	arithmetic	.
Further	down	,	you	start	getting	into	 pre 	 - 	 algebra 	 	and	early	algebra	.
Further	down	,	you	start	getting	into	algebra	one	,	algebra	two	,	a	little	bit	of	 pre 	 calculus 	 	.
And	the	idea	is	,	from	this	we	can	actually	teach	everything	--	well	,	everything	that	can	be	taught	in	this	type	of	a	framework	.
So	you	can	imagine	--	and	this	is	what	we	are	working	on	--	is	from	this	knowledge	map	you	have	logic	,	you	have	computer	programming	,	you	have	grammar	,	you	have	genetics	,	all	based	off	of	that	core	of	,	if	you	know	this	and	that	,	now	you	're	ready	for	this	next	concept	.
Now	that	can	work	well	for	an	individual	learner	,	and	I	encourage	,	one	,	for	you	to	do	it	with	your	kids	,	but	I	also	encourage	everyone	in	the	audience	to	do	it	yourself	.
It	'll	change	what	 happen 	 s 	 	at	the	dinner	table	.
But	what	we	want	to	do	is	to	use	the	natural	conclusion	of	the	flipping	of	the	classroom	that	those	early	teachers	had	 email 	 ed 	 	me	about	.
And	so	what	I	'm	showing	you	here	,	this	is	actually	data	from	a	pilot	in	the	Los	 Alto 	 s 	 	school	district	,	where	they	took	two	fifth	grade	classes	and	two	seventh	grade	classes	and	 complete 	 ly 	 	 gutt 	 ed 	 	their	old	math	curriculum	.
These	kids	are	n't	 us 	 ing 	 	 textbook 	 s 	 	,	they	're	not	getting	 one 	 - 	 size 	 - 	 fits 	 - 	 all 	 	lectures	.
They	're	 do 	 ing 	 	Khan	Academy	,	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	that	software	,	for	 rough 	 ly 	 	half	of	their	math	class	.
And	I	want	to	make	it	clear	,	we	do	n't	view	this	as	the	complete	math	education	.
What	it	does	is	--	and	this	is	what	's	happening	in	Los	 Alto 	 s 	 	--	it	 free 	 s 	 	up	time	.
This	is	the	blocking	and	 tack 	 ling 	 	,	making	sure	you	know	how	to	move	through	a	system	of	equations	,	and	it	 free 	 s 	 	up	time	for	the	 simulation 	 s 	 	,	for	the	games	,	for	the	mechanics	,	for	the	robot	building	,	for	the	estimating	how	high	that	hill	is	based	on	its	shadow	.
And	so	the	paradigm	is	the	teacher	walks	in	every	day	,	every	kid	works	at	their	own	pace	--	and	this	is	actually	a	live	dashboard	from	Los	 Alto 	 s 	 	school	district	--	and	they	look	at	this	dashboard	.
Every	row	is	a	student	.
Every	column	is	one	of	those	concepts	.
Green	means	the	student	's	already	 proficien 	 t 	 	.
Blue	means	they	're	working	on	it	--	no	need	to	worry	.
Red	means	they	're	stuck	.
And	what	the	teacher	does	is	literally	just	say	,	``	Let	me	 interven 	 e 	 	on	the	red	kids	.	''
Or	even	better	,	``	Let	me	get	one	of	the	green	kids	who	are	already	 proficien 	 t 	 	in	that	concept	to	be	the	first	line	of	attack	and	actually	tutor	their	peer	.	''
Now	I	come	from	a	very	 data 	 - 	 centric 	 	reality	,	so	we	do	n't	want	that	teacher	to	even	go	and	 interven 	 e 	 	and	have	to	ask	the	kid	awkward	questions	:	``	Oh	,	what	do	you	not	understand	?	''	or	``	What	do	you	do	understand	?	''
and	all	of	the	rest	.
So	our	paradigm	is	to	 re 	 ally 	 	arm	the	teachers	with	as	much	data	as	possible	--	 re 	 ally 	 	data	that	,	in	almost	any	other	field	,	is	expected	,	if	you	're	in	finance	or	marketing	or	manufacturing	--	and	so	the	teachers	can	actually	diagnose	what	's	wrong	with	the	students	so	they	can	make	their	interaction	as	productive	as	possible	.
So	now	the	teachers	know	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	the	students	have	been	up	to	,	how	long	they	have	been	spending	every	day	,	what	videos	have	they	been	watching	,	when	did	they	pause	the	videos	,	what	did	they	stop	watching	,	what	 exercise 	 s 	 	are	they	 us 	 ing 	 	,	what	have	they	been	focused	on	?
The	outer	circle	shows	what	 exercise 	 s 	 	they	were	focused	on	.
The	inner	circle	shows	the	videos	they	're	focused	on	.
And	the	data	 get 	 s 	 	pretty	granular	so	you	can	see	the	exact	problems	that	the	student	got	right	or	wrong	.
Red	is	wrong	,	blue	is	right	.
The	 left 	 most 	 	question	is	the	first	question	that	the	student	attempted	.
They	 watch 	 ed 	 	the	video	right	over	there	.
And	then	you	can	see	,	 eventual 	 ly 	 	,	they	were	able	to	get	10	in	a	row	.
It	's	almost	like	you	can	see	them	learning	over	those	last	10	problems	.
They	also	got	faster	.
The	height	is	how	long	it	took	them	.
So	when	you	talk	about	 self 	 - 	 paced 	 	learning	,	it	makes	sense	for	everyone	--	in	 education 	 - 	 speak 	 	,	differentiated	learning	--	but	it	's	kind	of	crazy	when	you	see	it	in	a	classroom	.
Because	every	time	we	've	done	this	,	in	every	classroom	we	've	done	,	over	and	over	again	,	if	you	go	five	days	into	it	,	there	's	a	group	of	kids	who	've	raced	 a 	 head 	 	and	there	's	a	group	of	kids	who	are	a	little	bit	 s 	 lower 	 	.
And	in	a	traditional	model	,	if	you	did	a	snapshot	assessment	,	you	say	,	``	These	are	the	gifted	kids	,	these	are	the	slow	kids	.
Maybe	they	should	be	tracked	 different 	 ly 	 	.
Maybe	we	should	put	them	in	different	classes	.	''
But	when	you	let	every	student	work	at	their	own	pace	--	and	we	see	it	over	and	over	and	over	again	--	you	see	students	who	took	a	little	bit	[	of	]	extra	time	on	one	concept	or	the	other	,	but	once	they	get	through	that	concept	,	they	just	race	 a 	 head 	 	.
And	so	the	same	kids	that	you	thought	were	slow	six	weeks	ago	,	you	now	would	think	are	gifted	.
And	we	're	seeing	it	over	and	over	and	over	again	.
And	it	makes	you	 re 	 ally 	 	wonder	how	much	all	of	the	labels	maybe	a	lot	of	us	have	 benefit 	 ed 	 	from	were	 re 	 ally 	 	just	due	to	a	 co 	 incidence 	 	of	time	.
Now	as	valuable	as	something	like	this	is	in	a	district	like	Los	 Alto 	 s 	 	,	our	goal	is	to	use	technology	to	humanize	,	not	just	in	Los	 Alto 	 s 	 	,	but	on	a	global	scale	,	what	's	happening	in	education	.
And	actually	,	that	kind	of	 bring 	 s 	 	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	point	.
A	lot	of	the	effort	in	humanizing	the	classroom	is	focused	on	 student 	 - 	 to 	 - 	 teacher 	 	 ratio 	 s 	 	.
In	our	mind	,	the	relevant	metric	is	 student 	 - 	 to 	 - 	 valuable 	 - 	 human 	 - 	 time 	 - 	 	 with 	 - 	 the 	 - 	 teacher 	 	ratio	.
So	in	a	traditional	model	,	most	of	the	teacher	's	time	is	spent	 do 	 ing 	 	lectures	and	grading	and	 what 	 not 	 	.
Maybe	five	percent	of	their	time	is	actually	sitting	next	to	students	and	actually	working	with	them	.
Now	100	percent	of	their	time	is	.
So	once	again	,	 us 	 ing 	 	technology	,	not	just	flipping	the	classroom	,	you	're	humanizing	the	classroom	,	I	'd	argue	,	by	a	factor	of	five	or	10	.
And	as	valuable	as	that	is	in	Los	 Alto 	 s 	 	,	imagine	what	that	does	to	the	adult	learner	who	's	 embarrass 	 ed 	 	to	go	back	and	learn	stuff	that	they	should	have	before	,	before	going	back	to	college	.
Imagine	what	it	does	to	a	street	kid	in	Calcutta	who	has	to	help	his	family	during	the	day	,	and	that	's	the	reason	why	he	or	she	ca	n't	go	to	school	.
Now	they	can	spend	two	hours	a	day	and	 re 	 mediate 	 	,	or	get	up	to	speed	and	not	feel	 embarrass 	 ed 	 	about	what	they	do	or	do	n't	know	.
Now	imagine	what	 happen 	 s 	 	where	--	we	talked	about	the	peers	teaching	each	other	inside	of	a	classroom	.
But	this	is	all	one	system	.
There	's	no	reason	why	you	ca	n't	have	that	 peer 	 - 	 to 	 - 	 peer 	 	 tutor 	 ing 	 	beyond	that	one	classroom	.
Imagine	what	 happen 	 s 	 	if	that	student	in	Calcutta	all	of	a	sudden	can	tutor	your	son	,	or	your	son	can	tutor	that	kid	in	Calcutta	?
And	I	think	what	you	'll	see	emerging	is	this	notion	of	a	global	 one 	 - 	 world 	 	classroom	.
And	that	's	 essential 	 ly 	 	what	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	build	.
Thank	you	.
Bill	Gates	:	I	've	seen	some	things	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	in	the	system	that	have	to	do	with	motivation	and	feedback	--	energy	points	,	merit	 badge 	 s 	 	.
Tell	me	what	you	're	thinking	there	.
SK	:	Oh	yeah	.	No	,	we	have	an	awesome	team	working	on	it	.
And	I	have	to	make	it	clear	,	it	's	not	just	me	 any 	 more 	 	.
I	'm	still	 do 	 ing 	 	all	the	videos	,	but	we	have	a	 rock 	 star 	 	team	 do 	 ing 	 	the	software	.
Yeah	,	we	've	put	a	bunch	of	game	mechanics	in	there	where	you	get	these	 badge 	 s 	 	,	we	're	going	to	start	having	leader	boards	by	area	,	and	you	get	points	.
It	's	actually	been	pretty	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
Just	the	 word 	 ing 	 	of	the	badging	or	how	many	points	you	get	for	 do 	 ing 	 	something	,	we	see	on	a	 system 	 - 	 wide 	 	basis	,	like	tens	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	fifth	graders	or	sixth	graders	going	one	direction	or	another	,	 depend 	 ing 	 	what	badge	you	give	them	.
BG	:	And	the	collaboration	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	with	Los	 Alto 	 s 	 	,	how	did	that	come	about	?
SK	:	Los	 Alto 	 s 	 	,	it	was	kind	of	crazy	.
Once	again	,	I	did	n't	expect	it	to	be	used	in	 classroom 	 s 	 	.
Someone	from	their	board	came	and	said	,	``	What	would	you	do	if	you	had	carte	blanche	in	a	classroom	?	''
And	I	said	,	``	Well	,	I	would	just	,	every	student	work	at	their	own	pace	on	something	like	this	and	we	'd	give	a	dashboard	.	''
And	they	said	,	``	Oh	,	this	is	kind	of	radical	.	We	have	to	think	about	it	.	''
And	me	and	the	rest	of	the	team	were	like	,	``	They	're	never	going	to	want	to	do	this	.	''
But	literally	the	next	day	they	were	like	,	``	Can	you	start	in	two	weeks	?	''
BG	:	So	fifth	grade	math	is	where	that	's	going	on	right	now	?
SK	:	It	's	two	fifth	grade	classes	and	two	seventh	grade	classes	.
And	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	it	at	the	district	level	.
I	think	what	they	're	excited	about	is	they	can	now	follow	these	kids	.
It	's	not	an	 only 	 - 	 in 	 - 	 school 	 	thing	.
We	've	even	,	on	Christmas	,	we	saw	some	of	the	kids	were	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
And	we	can	track	everything	.
So	they	can	actually	track	them	as	they	go	through	the	entire	district	.
Through	the	 summer 	 s 	 	,	as	they	go	from	one	teacher	to	the	next	,	you	have	this	continuity	of	data	that	even	at	the	district	level	they	can	see	.
BG	:	So	some	of	those	views	we	saw	were	for	the	teacher	to	go	in	and	track	actually	what	's	going	on	with	those	kids	.
So	you	're	getting	feedback	on	those	teacher	views	to	see	what	they	think	they	mean	?
SK	:	Oh	yeah	.	Most	of	those	were	specs	by	the	teachers	.
We	made	some	of	those	for	students	so	they	could	see	their	data	,	but	we	have	a	very	tight	design	loop	with	the	teachers	themselves	.
And	they	're	literally	saying	,	``	Hey	,	this	is	nice	,	but	...	``	Like	that	focus	graph	,	a	lot	of	the	teachers	said	,	``	I	have	a	feeling	that	a	lot	of	the	kids	are	jumping	around	and	not	focusing	on	one	topic	.	''
So	we	made	that	focus	diagram	.
So	it	's	all	been	 teacher 	 - 	 driven 	 	.
It	's	been	pretty	crazy	.
BG	:	Is	this	ready	for	prime	time	?
Do	you	think	a	lot	of	classes	next	school	year	should	try	this	thing	out	?
SK	:	Yeah	,	it	's	ready	.
We	've	got	a	million	people	on	the	site	already	,	so	we	can	handle	a	few	more	.
No	,	no	reason	why	it	 re 	 ally 	 	ca	n't	happen	in	every	classroom	in	America	tomorrow	.
BG	:	And	the	vision	of	the	 tutor 	 ing 	 	thing	.
The	idea	there	is	,	if	I	'm	 confus 	 ed 	 	about	a	topic	,	 some 	 how 	 	right	in	the	user	interface	I	'd	find	people	who	are	 volunteer 	 ing 	 	,	maybe	see	their	reputation	,	and	I	could	schedule	and	connect	up	with	those	people	?
SK	:	 Absolute 	 ly 	 	.	And	this	is	something	that	I	recommend	everyone	in	this	audience	to	do	.
Those	 dashboard 	 s 	 	the	teachers	have	,	you	can	go	log	in	right	now	and	you	can	 essential 	 ly 	 	become	a	coach	for	your	kids	,	or	 nephew 	 s 	 	,	or	 cousin 	 s 	 	,	or	maybe	some	kids	at	the	Boys	and	Girls	Club	.
And	yeah	,	you	can	start	becoming	a	mentor	,	a	tutor	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 immediate 	 ly 	 	.
But	yeah	,	it	's	all	there	.
BG	:	Well	,	it	's	amazing	.
I	think	you	just	got	a	 glimps 	 e 	 	of	the	future	of	education	.
Thank	you	.

In	the	deep	,	dark	ocean	,	many	sea	creatures	make	their	own	light	for	hunting	,	mating	and	 self 	 - 	 defense 	 	.

Edith	Widder	:	The	weird	,	wonderful	world	of	 bio 	 luminescence 	 
So	I	want	to	take	you	on	a	trip	to	an	alien	world	.
And	it	's	not	a	trip	that	 require 	 s 	 	 light 	 - 	 years 	 	of	travel	,	but	it	's	to	a	place	where	it	's	defined	by	light	.
So	it	's	a	 little 	 - 	 appreciated 	 	fact	that	most	of	the	animals	in	our	ocean	make	light	.
I	've	spent	most	of	my	career	 study 	 ing 	 	this	phenomenon	called	 bio 	 luminescence 	 	.
I	study	it	because	I	think	understanding	it	is	critical	to	understanding	life	in	the	ocean	where	most	 bio 	 luminescence 	 	occurs	.
I	also	use	it	as	a	tool	for	 visual 	 izing 	 	and	tracking	pollution	.
But	mostly	I	'm	 entrance 	 d 	 	by	it	.
Since	my	my	first	dive	in	a	 deep 	 - 	 diving 	 	submersible	,	when	I	went	down	and	turned	out	the	lights	and	saw	the	 fire 	 works 	 	 display 	 s 	 	,	I	've	been	a	 bio 	 luminescence 	 	 junk 	 y 	 	.
But	I	would	come	back	from	those	dives	and	try	to	share	the	experience	with	words	,	and	they	were	totally	 in 	 adequate 	 	to	the	task	.
I	needed	some	way	to	share	the	experience	directly	.
And	the	first	time	I	figured	out	that	way	was	in	this	little	 single 	 - 	 person 	 	submersible	called	Deep	Rover	.
This	next	video	clip	,	you	're	going	to	see	how	we	stimulated	the	 bio 	 luminescence 	 	.
And	the	first	thing	you	're	going	to	see	is	a	transect	screen	that	is	about	a	meter	across	.
Narrator	:	In	front	of	the	sub	,	a	mess	screen	will	come	into	contact	with	the	 soft 	 - 	 bodied 	 	creatures	of	the	deep	sea	.
With	the	sub	's	lights	 switch 	 ed 	 	off	,	it	is	possible	to	see	their	 bio 	 luminescence 	 	--	the	light	produced	when	they	collide	with	the	mesh	.
This	is	the	first	time	it	has	ever	been	recorded	.
Edith	Widder	:	So	I	recorded	that	with	an	 intens 	 ified 	 	video	camera	that	has	about	the	sensitivity	of	the	fully	 dark 	 - 	 adapted 	 	human	eye	.
Which	means	that	 re 	 ally 	 	is	what	you	would	see	if	you	took	a	dive	in	a	submersible	.
But	just	to	try	to	prove	that	fact	to	you	,	I	've	brought	along	some	 bio 	 luminescent 	 	plankton	in	what	is	 undoubted 	 ly 	 	a	 fool 	 hardy 	 	attempt	at	a	live	demonstration	.
So	,	if	we	could	have	the	lights	down	and	have	it	as	dark	in	here	as	possible	,	I	have	a	flask	that	has	 bio 	 luminescent 	 	plankton	in	it	.
And	you	'll	note	there	's	no	light	coming	from	them	right	now	,	either	because	they	're	dead	--	or	because	I	need	to	stir	them	up	in	some	way	for	you	to	see	what	 bio 	 luminescence 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	looks	like	.
Oops	.	Sorry	.
I	spend	most	of	my	time	working	in	the	dark	;	I	'm	used	to	that	.
Okay	.
So	that	light	was	made	by	a	 bio 	 luminescent 	 	 dino 	 flagellate 	 	,	a	 single 	 - 	 celled 	 	 al 	 ga 	 	.
So	why	would	a	 single 	 - 	 celled 	 	 al 	 ga 	 	need	to	be	able	to	produce	light	?
Well	,	it	uses	it	to	defend	itself	from	its	 predator 	 s 	 	.
The	flash	is	like	a	scream	for	help	.
It	's	what	's	known	as	a	 bio 	 luminescent 	 	burglar	alarm	,	and	just	like	the	alarm	on	your	car	or	your	house	,	it	's	meant	to	cast	unwanted	attention	onto	the	intruder	,	 there 	 by 	 	either	leading	to	his	capture	or	 scar 	 ing 	 	him	away	.
There	's	a	lot	of	animals	that	use	this	trick	,	for	example	this	black	 dragon 	 fish 	 	.
It	's	got	a	light	organ	under	its	eye	.
It	's	got	a	chin	barbel	.
It	's	got	a	lot	of	other	light	organs	you	ca	n't	see	,	but	you	'll	see	in	here	in	a	minute	.
So	we	had	to	chase	this	in	the	submersible	for	quite	 some 	 time 	 	,	because	the	top	speed	of	this	fish	is	one	knot	,	which	was	the	top	speed	of	the	submersible	.
But	it	was	worth	it	,	because	we	caught	it	in	a	special	capture	device	,	brought	it	up	into	the	lab	on	the	ship	,	and	then	everything	on	this	fish	lights	up	.
It	's	 un 	 believ 	 able 	 	.
The	light	organs	under	the	eyes	are	 flash 	 ing 	 	.
That	chin	barbel	is	 flash 	 ing 	 	.
It	's	got	light	organs	on	its	belly	that	are	 flash 	 ing 	 	,	fin	lights	.
It	's	a	scream	for	help	;	it	's	meant	to	attract	attention	.
It	's	phenomenal	.
And	you	 normal 	 ly 	 	do	n't	get	to	see	this	because	we	've	 exhaust 	 ed 	 	the	luminescence	when	we	bring	them	up	in	nets	.
There	's	other	ways	you	can	defend	yourself	with	light	.
For	example	,	this	shrimp	releases	its	 bio 	 luminescent 	 	chemicals	into	the	water	just	the	way	a	squid	or	an	octopus	would	release	an	ink	cloud	.
This	 blind 	 s 	 	or	 distract 	 s 	 	the	predator	.
This	little	squid	is	called	the	fire	shooter	because	of	its	ability	to	do	this	.
Now	it	may	look	like	a	 tas 	 ty 	 	morsel	,	or	a	pig	's	head	with	wings	--	but	if	it	's	 attack 	 ed 	 	,	it	puts	out	a	barrage	of	light	--	in	fact	,	a	barrage	of	photon	 torpedo 	 es 	 	.
I	just	 bare 	 ly 	 	got	the	lights	out	in	time	for	you	to	be	able	to	see	those	 gob 	 s 	 	of	light	hitting	the	transect	screen	and	then	just	 glow 	 ing 	 	.
It	's	phenomenal	.
So	there	's	a	lot	of	animals	in	the	open	ocean	--	most	of	them	that	make	light	.
And	we	have	a	pretty	good	idea	,	for	most	of	them	,	why	.
They	use	it	for	finding	food	,	for	 attract 	 ing 	 	mates	,	for	 defend 	 ing 	 	against	 predator 	 s 	 	.
But	when	you	get	down	to	the	bottom	of	the	ocean	,	that	's	where	things	get	 re 	 ally 	 	strange	.
And	some	of	these	animals	are	probably	inspiration	for	the	things	you	saw	in	``	Avatar	,	''	but	you	do	n't	have	to	travel	to	Pandora	to	see	them	.
They	're	things	like	this	.
This	is	a	golden	coral	,	a	bush	.
It	 grow 	 s 	 	very	 slow 	 ly 	 	.
In	fact	,	it	's	thought	that	some	of	these	are	as	much	as	3,000	years	old	,	which	is	one	reason	that	bottom	 trawl 	 ing 	 	should	not	be	allowed	.
The	other	reason	is	this	amazing	bush	 glow 	 s 	 	.
So	if	you	brush	up	against	it	,	any	place	you	 brush 	 ed 	 	against	it	,	you	get	this	 twink 	 ling 	 	 blue 	 - 	 green 	 	light	that	's	just	 breath 	 taking 	 	.
And	you	see	things	like	this	.
This	looks	like	something	out	of	a	Dr.	Seuss	book	--	just	all	manner	of	creatures	all	over	this	thing	.
And	these	are	 fly 	 trap 	 	 anemone 	 s 	 	.
Now	if	you	poke	it	,	it	 pull 	 s 	 	in	its	 tentacle 	 s 	 	.
But	if	you	keep	 pok 	 ing 	 	it	,	it	starts	to	produce	light	.
And	it	actually	ends	up	looking	like	a	galaxy	.
It	produces	these	strings	of	light	,	 presum 	 ably 	 	as	some	form	of	defense	.
There	are	 star 	 fish 	 	that	can	make	light	.
And	there	are	brittle	stars	that	produce	bands	of	light	that	dance	along	their	arms	.
This	looks	like	a	plant	,	but	it	's	actually	an	animal	.
And	it	 anchor 	 s 	 	itself	in	the	sand	by	blowing	up	a	balloon	on	the	end	of	its	stock	.
So	it	can	actually	hold	itself	in	very	strong	currents	,	as	you	see	here	.
But	if	we	collect	it	very	gently	,	and	we	bring	it	up	into	the	lab	and	just	squeeze	it	at	the	base	of	the	stock	,	it	produces	this	light	that	 propagate 	 s 	 	from	stem	to	the	plume	,	changing	color	as	it	goes	,	from	green	to	blue	.
 Color 	 ization 	 	and	sound	effects	added	for	you	viewing	pleasure	.
But	we	have	no	idea	why	it	does	that	.
Here	's	another	one	.	This	is	also	a	sea	pen	.
It	's	got	a	brittle	star	 hitch 	 ing 	 	a	ride	.
It	's	a	green	saber	of	light	.
And	like	the	one	you	just	saw	,	it	can	produce	these	as	bands	of	light	.
So	if	I	squeeze	the	base	,	the	bands	go	from	base	to	tip	.
If	I	squeeze	the	tip	,	they	go	from	tip	to	base	.
So	what	do	you	think	 happen 	 s 	 	if	you	squeeze	it	in	the	middle	?
I	'd	be	very	interested	in	your	theories	about	what	that	's	about	.
So	there	's	a	language	of	light	in	the	deep	ocean	,	and	we	're	just	beginning	to	understand	it	,	and	one	way	we	're	going	about	that	is	we	're	 imitat 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	these	 display 	 s 	 	.
This	is	an	optical	lure	that	I	've	used	.
We	call	it	the	electronic	jellyfish	.
It	's	just	16	blue	 LED 	 s 	 	that	we	can	program	to	do	different	types	of	 display 	 s 	 	.
And	we	view	it	with	a	camera	system	I	developed	called	 Eye 	 - 	 in 	 - 	 the 	 - 	 Sea 	 	that	uses	far	red	light	that	's	invisible	to	most	animals	,	so	it	's	 un 	 obtrusive 	 	.
So	I	just	want	to	show	you	some	of	the	responses	we	've	 elicit 	 ed 	 	from	animals	in	the	deep	sea	.
So	the	camera	's	black	and	white	.
It	's	not	 high 	 - 	 resolution 	 	.
And	what	you	're	seeing	here	is	a	bait	box	with	a	bunch	of	--	like	the	 cockroach 	 es 	 	of	the	ocean	--	there	are	 iso 	 pods 	 	all	over	it	.
And	right	in	the	front	is	the	electronic	jellyfish	.
And	when	it	starts	 flash 	 ing 	 	,	it	's	just	going	to	be	one	of	the	 LED 	 s 	 	that	's	 flash 	 ing 	 	very	fast	.
But	as	soon	as	it	starts	to	flash	--	and	it	's	going	to	look	big	,	because	it	 bloom 	 s 	 	on	the	camera	--	I	want	you	to	look	right	here	.
There	's	something	small	there	that	 respond 	 s 	 	.
We	're	talking	to	something	.
It	looks	like	a	little	of	string	 pearl 	 s 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	--	in	fact	,	three	strings	of	 pearl 	 s 	 	.
And	this	was	very	consistent	.
This	was	in	the	Bahamas	at	about	2,000	feet	.
We	 bas 	 ically 	 	have	a	chat	room	going	on	here	,	because	once	it	 get 	 s 	 	started	,	everybody	's	talking	.
And	I	think	this	is	actually	a	shrimp	that	's	 releas 	 ing 	 	its	 bio 	 luminescent 	 	chemicals	into	the	water	.
But	the	cool	thing	is	,	we	're	talking	to	it	.
We	do	n't	know	what	we	're	saying	.
 Personal 	 ly 	 	,	I	think	it	's	something	sexy	.
And	then	finally	,	I	want	to	show	you	some	responses	that	we	recorded	with	the	world	's	first	 deep 	 - 	 sea 	 	 web 	 cam 	 	,	which	we	had	installed	in	Monterey	Canyon	last	year	.
We	've	only	just	begun	to	analyze	all	of	this	data	.
This	is	going	to	be	a	 glow 	 ing 	 	source	first	,	which	is	like	 bio 	 luminescent 	 	bacteria	.
And	it	is	an	optical	cue	that	there	's	carrion	on	the	bottom	of	the	ocean	.
So	this	scavenger	comes	in	,	which	is	a	giant	 six 	 gill 	 	shark	.
And	I	ca	n't	claim	for	sure	that	the	optical	source	brought	it	in	,	because	there	's	bait	right	there	.
But	if	it	had	been	following	the	odor	plume	,	it	would	have	come	in	from	the	other	direction	.
And	it	does	actually	seem	to	be	 try 	 ing 	 	to	eat	the	electronic	jellyfish	.
That	's	a	12-foot-long	giant	 six 	 gill 	 	shark	.
Okay	,	so	this	next	one	is	from	the	 web 	 cam 	 	,	and	it	's	going	to	be	this	pinwheel	display	.
And	this	is	a	burglar	alarm	.
And	that	was	a	Humboldt	squid	,	a	juvenile	Humboldt	squid	,	about	three	feet	long	.
This	is	at	3,000	feet	in	Monterey	Canyon	.
But	if	it	's	a	burglar	alarm	,	you	would	n't	expect	it	to	attack	the	jellyfish	directly	.
It	's	 s 	 upposed 	 	to	be	 attack 	 ing 	 	what	's	 attack 	 ing 	 	the	jellyfish	.
But	we	did	see	a	bunch	of	responses	like	this	.
This	guy	is	a	little	more	 contempla 	 tive 	 	.
``	Hey	,	wait	a	minute	.
There	's	 s 	 upposed 	 	to	be	something	else	there	.	''
He	's	thinking	about	it	.
But	he	's	persistent	.
He	keeps	coming	back	.
And	then	he	goes	away	for	a	few	seconds	to	think	about	it	some	more	,	and	 think 	 s 	 	,	``	Maybe	if	I	come	in	from	a	different	angle	.	''
Nope	.
So	we	are	starting	to	get	a	handle	on	this	,	but	only	just	the	 beginning 	 s 	 	.
We	need	more	eyes	on	the	process	.
So	if	any	of	you	ever	get	a	chance	to	take	a	dive	in	a	submersible	,	by	all	means	,	climb	in	and	take	the	plunge	.
This	is	something	that	should	be	on	everybody	's	bucket	list	,	because	we	live	on	an	ocean	planet	.
More	than	90	percent	,	99	percent	,	of	the	living	space	on	our	planet	is	ocean	.
It	's	a	magical	place	filled	with	 breath 	 taking 	 	light	shows	and	bizarre	and	wondrous	creatures	,	alien	life	forms	that	you	do	n't	have	to	travel	to	another	planet	to	see	.
But	if	you	do	take	the	plunge	,	please	remember	to	turn	out	the	lights	.
But	I	warn	you	,	it	's	addictive	.
Thank	you	.

Jonathan	 Haid 	 t 	 	on	the	moral	roots	of	 liberal 	 s 	 	and	 conservative 	 s 	 
Suppose	that	two	American	friends	are	 travel 	 ing 	 	together	in	Italy	.
They	go	to	see	Michelangelo	's	``	David	,	''	and	when	they	finally	come	face	to	face	with	the	statue	,	they	both	freeze	dead	in	their	tracks	.
The	first	guy	--	we	'll	call	him	Adam	--	is	 transfix 	 ed 	 	by	the	beauty	of	the	perfect	human	form	.
The	second	guy	--	we	'll	call	him	Bill	--	is	 transfix 	 ed 	 	by	 embarrass 	 ment 	 	,	at	 star 	 ing 	 	at	the	thing	there	in	the	center	.
So	here	's	my	question	for	you	:	which	one	of	these	two	guys	was	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	have	voted	for	George	Bush	,	which	for	Al	Gore	?
I	do	n't	need	a	show	of	hands	because	we	all	have	the	same	political	 stereotype 	 s 	 	.
We	all	know	that	it	's	Bill	.
And	in	this	case	,	the	stereotype	 correspond 	 s 	 	to	reality	.
It	 re 	 ally 	 	is	a	fact	that	 liberal 	 s 	 	are	much	higher	than	 conservative 	 s 	 	on	a	major	personality	trait	called	 open 	 ness 	 	to	experience	.
People	who	are	high	in	 open 	 ness 	 	to	experience	just	crave	 novel 	 ty 	 	,	variety	,	diversity	,	new	ideas	,	travel	.
People	low	on	it	like	things	that	are	familiar	,	that	are	safe	and	 depend 	 able 	 	.
If	you	know	about	this	trait	,	you	can	understand	a	lot	of	 puzzle 	 s 	 	about	human	behavior	.
You	can	understand	why	artists	are	so	different	from	 account 	 ants 	 	.
You	can	actually	predict	what	 kind 	 s 	 	of	books	they	like	to	read	,	what	 kind 	 s 	 	of	places	they	like	to	travel	to	,	and	what	 kind 	 s 	 	of	food	they	like	to	eat	.
Once	you	understand	this	trait	,	you	can	understand	why	 any 	 body 	 	would	eat	at	 Apple 	 bee 	 	's	,	but	not	 any 	 body 	 	that	you	know	.
This	trait	also	 tell 	 s 	 	us	a	lot	about	politics	.
The	main	 research 	 er 	 	of	this	trait	,	Robert	McCrae	says	that	,	``	Open	 individual 	 s 	 	have	an	affinity	for	liberal	,	progressive	,	 left 	 - 	 wing 	 	political	views	''	--	they	like	a	society	which	is	open	and	changing	--	``	whereas	closed	 individual 	 s 	 	prefer	conservative	,	traditional	,	 right 	 - 	 wing 	 	views	.	''
This	trait	also	 tell 	 s 	 	us	a	lot	about	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	groups	people	join	.
So	here	's	the	description	of	a	group	I	found	on	the	Web	.
What	 kind 	 s 	 	of	people	would	join	a	global	community	 welcom 	 ing 	 	people	from	every	discipline	and	culture	,	who	seek	a	 deep 	 er 	 	understanding	of	the	world	,	and	who	hope	to	turn	that	understanding	into	a	better	future	for	us	all	?
This	is	from	some	guy	named	Ted	.
Well	,	let	's	see	now	,	if	 open 	 ness 	 	 predict 	 s 	 	who	becomes	liberal	,	and	 open 	 ness 	 	 predict 	 s 	 	who	becomes	a	 TED 	 ster 	 	,	then	might	we	predict	that	most	 TED 	 sters 	 	are	liberal	?
Let	's	find	out	.
I	'm	going	to	ask	you	to	raise	your	hand	,	whether	you	are	liberal	,	left	of	center	--	on	social	issues	,	we	're	talking	about	,	 primaril 	 y 	 	--	or	conservative	,	and	I	'll	give	a	third	option	,	because	I	know	there	are	a	number	of	 libertarian 	 s 	 	in	the	audience	.
So	,	right	now	,	please	raise	your	hand	--	down	in	the	simulcast	rooms	,	too	,	let	's	let	everybody	see	who	's	here	--	please	raise	your	hand	if	you	would	say	that	you	are	liberal	or	left	of	center	.
Please	raise	your	hand	high	right	now	.	OK	.
Please	raise	your	hand	if	you	'd	say	you	're	libertarian	.
OK	,	about	a	--	two	dozen	.
And	please	raise	your	hand	if	you	'd	say	you	are	right	of	center	or	conservative	.
One	,	two	,	three	,	four	,	five	--	about	eight	or	10	.
OK	.	This	is	a	bit	of	a	problem	.
Because	if	our	goal	is	to	understand	the	world	,	to	seek	a	 deep 	 er 	 	understanding	of	the	world	,	our	general	lack	of	moral	diversity	here	is	going	to	make	it	 hard 	 er 	 	.
Because	when	people	all	share	values	,	when	people	all	share	 moral 	 s 	 	,	they	become	a	team	,	and	once	you	engage	the	psychology	of	teams	,	it	 shut 	 s 	 	down	 open 	 - 	 minded 	 	thinking	.
When	the	liberal	team	 lose 	 s 	 	,	as	it	did	in	2004	,	and	as	it	almost	did	in	2000	,	we	comfort	 our 	 selves 	 	.
We	try	to	explain	why	half	of	America	voted	for	the	other	team	.
We	think	they	must	be	 blind 	 ed 	 	by	religion	,	or	by	simple	 stupid 	 ity 	 	.
So	,	if	you	think	that	half	of	America	votes	Republican	because	they	are	 blind 	 ed 	 	in	this	way	,	then	my	message	to	you	is	that	you	're	trapped	in	a	moral	matrix	,	in	a	particular	moral	matrix	.
And	by	the	matrix	,	I	mean	literally	the	matrix	,	like	the	movie	``	The	Matrix	.	''
But	I	'm	here	today	to	give	you	a	choice	.
You	can	either	take	the	blue	pill	and	stick	to	your	 comfort 	 ing 	 	 delusion 	 s 	 	,	or	you	can	take	the	red	pill	,	learn	some	moral	psychology	and	step	outside	the	moral	matrix	.
Now	,	because	I	know	--	--	OK	,	I	assume	that	answers	my	question	.
I	was	going	to	ask	you	which	one	you	picked	,	but	no	need	.
You	're	all	high	in	 open 	 ness 	 	to	experience	,	and	besides	,	it	looks	like	it	might	even	taste	good	,	and	you	're	all	 epicure 	 s 	 	.
So	 any 	 way 	 	,	let	's	go	with	the	red	pill	.
Let	's	study	some	moral	psychology	and	see	where	it	takes	us	.
Let	's	start	at	the	beginning	.
What	is	morality	and	where	does	it	come	from	?
The	worst	idea	in	all	of	psychology	is	the	idea	that	the	mind	is	a	blank	slate	at	birth	.
 Development 	 al 	 	psychology	has	shown	that	kids	come	into	the	world	already	knowing	so	much	about	the	physical	and	social	worlds	,	and	programmed	to	make	it	 re 	 ally 	 	easy	for	them	to	learn	certain	things	and	hard	to	learn	others	.
The	best	definition	of	 in 	 nate 	 ness 	 	I	've	ever	seen	--	this	just	 clarifi 	 es 	 	so	many	things	for	me	--	is	from	the	brain	scientist	Gary	Marcus	.
He	says	,	``	The	initial	organization	of	the	brain	does	not	depend	that	much	on	experience	.
Nature	provides	a	first	draft	,	which	experience	then	 revis 	 es 	 	.
 Built 	 - 	 in 	 	does	n't	mean	 un 	 malle 	 able 	 	;	it	means	organized	in	advance	of	experience	.	''
OK	,	so	what	's	on	the	first	draft	of	the	moral	mind	?
To	find	out	,	my	colleague	,	Craig	Joseph	,	and	I	read	through	the	literature	on	anthropology	,	on	culture	variation	in	morality	and	also	on	evolutionary	psychology	,	looking	for	matches	.
What	are	the	 sort 	 s 	 	of	things	that	people	talk	about	across	disciplines	?
That	you	find	across	cultures	and	even	across	species	?
We	found	five	--	five	best	matches	,	which	we	call	the	five	 foundation 	 s 	 	of	morality	.
The	first	one	is	 harm 	 / 	 care 	 	.
We	're	all	mammals	here	,	we	all	have	a	lot	of	neural	and	hormonal	programming	that	makes	us	 re 	 ally 	 	bond	with	others	,	care	for	others	,	feel	compassion	for	others	,	especially	the	weak	and	vulnerable	.
It	gives	us	very	strong	 feeling 	 s 	 	about	those	who	cause	harm	.
This	moral	foundation	 under 	 lies 	 	about	70	percent	of	the	moral	statements	I	've	heard	here	at	TED	.
The	second	foundation	is	 fair 	 ness 	 / 	 recipro 	 city 	 	.
There	's	actually	ambiguous	evidence	as	to	whether	you	find	 recipro 	 city 	 	in	other	animals	,	but	the	evidence	for	people	could	not	be	 clear 	 er 	 	.
This	Norman	Rockwell	painting	is	called	``	The	Golden	Rule	,	''	and	we	heard	about	this	from	Karen	Armstrong	,	of	course	,	as	the	foundation	of	so	many	religions	.
That	second	foundation	 under 	 lies 	 	the	other	30	percent	of	the	moral	statements	I	've	heard	here	at	TED	.
The	third	foundation	is	 in 	 - 	 group 	 / 	 loyalty 	 	.
You	do	find	groups	in	the	animal	kingdom	--	you	do	find	cooperative	groups	--	but	these	groups	are	always	either	very	small	or	they	're	all	siblings	.
It	's	only	among	humans	that	you	find	very	large	groups	of	people	who	are	able	to	 cooperat 	 e 	 	,	join	together	into	groups	,	but	in	this	case	,	groups	that	are	united	to	fight	other	groups	.
This	probably	comes	from	our	long	history	of	tribal	living	,	of	tribal	psychology	.
And	this	tribal	psychology	is	so	 deep 	 ly 	 	 pleasur 	 able 	 	that	even	when	we	do	n't	have	tribes	,	we	go	 a 	 head 	 	and	make	them	,	because	it	's	fun	.
Sports	is	to	war	as	pornography	is	to	sex	.
We	get	to	exercise	some	ancient	,	ancient	drives	.
The	fourth	foundation	is	 authority 	 / 	 respect 	 	.
Here	you	see	submissive	 gesture 	 s 	 	from	two	members	of	very	 close 	 ly 	 	related	species	.
But	authority	in	humans	is	not	so	 close 	 ly 	 	based	on	power	and	 brutal 	 ity 	 	,	as	it	is	in	other	 primate 	 s 	 	.
It	's	based	on	more	voluntary	 de 	 ference 	 	,	and	even	elements	of	love	,	at	times	.
The	fifth	foundation	is	 purity 	 / 	 sancti 	 ty 	 	.
This	painting	is	called	``	The	 Allegor 	 y 	 	Of	 Chast 	 ity 	 	,	''	but	purity	's	not	just	about	 suppress 	 ing 	 	female	sexuality	.
It	's	about	any	kind	of	ideology	,	any	kind	of	idea	that	 tell 	 s 	 	you	that	you	can	attain	virtue	by	controlling	what	you	do	with	your	body	,	by	controlling	what	you	put	into	your	body	.
And	while	the	political	right	may	moralize	sex	much	more	,	the	political	left	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	it	with	food	.
Food	is	becoming	 extreme 	 ly 	 	 moral 	 ized 	 	 nowaday 	 s 	 	,	and	a	lot	of	it	is	ideas	about	purity	,	about	what	you	're	willing	to	touch	,	or	put	into	your	body	.
I	believe	these	are	the	five	best	candidates	for	what	's	written	on	the	first	draft	of	the	moral	mind	.
I	think	this	is	what	we	come	with	,	at	least	a	preparedness	to	learn	all	of	these	things	.
But	as	my	son	,	Max	,	 grow 	 s 	 	up	in	a	liberal	college	town	,	how	is	this	first	draft	going	to	get	 revis 	 ed 	 	?
And	how	will	it	end	up	being	different	from	a	kid	born	60	miles	south	of	us	in	 Lynch 	 burg 	 	,	Virginia	?
To	think	about	culture	variation	,	let	's	try	a	different	metaphor	.
If	there	 re 	 ally 	 	are	five	systems	at	work	in	the	mind	--	five	sources	of	 intuition 	 s 	 	and	emotions	--	then	we	can	think	of	the	moral	mind	as	being	like	one	of	those	audio	 equal 	 izers 	 	that	has	five	channels	,	where	you	can	set	it	to	a	different	setting	on	every	channel	.
And	my	 colleague 	 s 	 	,	Brian	 Nose 	 k 	 	and	Jesse	Graham	,	and	I	,	made	a	 question 	 naire 	 	,	which	we	put	up	on	the	Web	at	 www. 	 Your 	 Moral 	 s.org 	 	.
And	so	far	,	30,000	people	have	taken	this	 question 	 naire 	 	,	and	you	can	too	.
Here	are	the	results	.
Here	are	the	results	from	about	23,000	American	citizens	.
On	the	left	,	I	've	plotted	the	scores	for	 liberal 	 s 	 	;	on	the	right	,	those	for	 conservative 	 s 	 	;	in	the	middle	,	the	 moderat 	 es 	 	.
The	blue	line	shows	you	people	's	responses	on	the	average	of	all	the	harm	questions	.
So	,	as	you	see	,	people	care	about	harm	and	care	issues	.
They	give	high	endorsement	of	these	 sort 	 s 	 	of	statements	all	across	the	board	,	but	as	you	also	see	,	 liberal 	 s 	 	care	about	it	a	little	more	than	 conservative 	 s 	 	--	the	line	slopes	down	.
Same	story	for	 fair 	 ness 	 	.
But	look	at	the	other	three	lines	.
For	 liberal 	 s 	 	,	the	scores	are	very	low	.
 Liberal 	 s 	 	are	 bas 	 ically 	 	saying	,	``	No	,	this	is	not	morality	.
 In 	 - 	 group 	 	,	authority	,	purity	--	this	stuff	has	nothing	to	do	with	morality	.	I	reject	it	.	''
But	as	people	get	more	conservative	,	the	values	rise	.
We	can	say	that	 liberal 	 s 	 	have	a	kind	of	a	 two 	 - 	 channel 	 	,	or	 two 	 - 	 foundation 	 	morality	.
 Conservative 	 s 	 	have	more	of	a	 five 	 - 	 foundation 	 	,	or	 five 	 - 	 channel 	 	morality	.
We	find	this	in	every	country	we	look	at	.
Here	's	the	data	for	1,100	 Canadian 	 s 	 	.
I	'll	just	flip	through	a	few	other	slides	.
The	U.K.	,	Australia	,	New	Zealand	,	Western	Europe	,	Eastern	Europe	,	Latin	America	,	the	Middle	East	,	East	Asia	and	South	Asia	.
Notice	also	that	on	all	of	these	graphs	,	the	slope	is	 steep 	 er 	 	on	 in 	 - 	 group 	 	,	authority	,	purity	.
Which	shows	that	within	any	country	,	the	 dis 	 agreement 	 	is	n't	over	harm	and	 fair 	 ness 	 	.
Everybody	--	I	mean	,	we	debate	over	what	's	fair	--	but	everybody	 agree 	 s 	 	that	harm	and	 fair 	 ness 	 	matter	.
Moral	arguments	within	cultures	are	especially	about	issues	of	 in 	 - 	 group 	 	,	authority	,	purity	.
This	effect	is	so	robust	that	we	find	it	no	matter	how	we	ask	the	question	.
In	one	recent	study	,	we	asked	people	to	suppose	you	're	about	to	get	a	dog	.
You	picked	a	particular	breed	,	you	learned	some	new	information	about	the	breed	.
Suppose	you	learn	that	this	particular	breed	is	 independent 	 - 	 minded 	 	,	and	 relate 	 s 	 	to	its	owner	as	a	friend	and	an	equal	?
Well	,	if	you	are	a	liberal	,	you	say	,	``	Hey	,	that	's	great	!	''
Because	 liberal 	 s 	 	like	to	say	,	``	Fetch	,	please	.	''
But	if	you	're	conservative	,	that	's	not	so	attractive	.
If	you	're	conservative	,	and	you	learn	that	a	dog	's	 extreme 	 ly 	 	loyal	to	its	home	and	family	,	and	does	n't	warm	up	quickly	to	 stranger 	 s 	 	,	for	 conservative 	 s 	 	,	well	,	loyalty	is	good	--	dogs	ought	to	be	loyal	.
But	to	a	liberal	,	it	sounds	like	this	dog	is	running	for	the	Republican	nomination	.
So	,	you	might	say	,	OK	,	there	are	these	differences	between	 liberal 	 s 	 	and	 conservative 	 s 	 	,	but	what	makes	those	three	other	 foundation 	 s 	 	moral	?
Are	n't	those	just	the	 foundation 	 s 	 	of	 xeno 	 phobia 	 	and	 authoritarian 	 ism 	 	and	 Puritan 	 ism 	 	?
What	makes	them	moral	?
The	answer	,	I	think	,	is	contained	in	this	 incredibl 	 e 	 	triptych	from	Hieronymus	Bosch	,	``	The	Garden	of	 Earth 	 ly 	 	 Delight 	 s 	 	.	''
In	the	first	panel	,	we	see	the	moment	of	creation	.
All	is	ordered	,	all	is	beautiful	,	all	the	people	and	animals	are	 do 	 ing 	 	what	they	're	 s 	 upposed 	 	to	be	 do 	 ing 	 	,	where	they	're	 s 	 upposed 	 	to	be	.
But	then	,	given	the	way	of	the	world	,	things	change	.
We	get	every	person	 do 	 ing 	 	whatever	he	 want 	 s 	 	,	with	every	aperture	of	every	other	person	and	every	other	animal	.
Some	of	you	might	 recogniz 	 e 	 	this	as	the	'60s	.
But	the	'60s	 inevit 	 ably 	 	gives	way	to	the	'70s	,	where	the	 cutting 	 s 	 	of	the	 aperture 	 s 	 	hurt	a	little	bit	more	.
Of	course	,	Bosch	called	this	hell	.
So	this	triptych	,	these	three	panels	portray	the	 time 	 less 	 	truth	that	order	 tend 	 s 	 	to	decay	.
The	truth	of	social	entropy	.
But	lest	you	think	this	is	just	some	part	of	the	Christian	imagination	where	Christians	have	this	weird	problem	with	pleasure	,	here	's	the	same	story	,	the	same	progression	,	told	in	a	paper	that	was	published	in	Nature	a	few	years	ago	,	in	which	Ernst	Fehr	and	Simon	 G 	 achter 	 	had	people	play	a	commons	dilemma	.
A	game	in	which	you	give	people	money	,	and	then	,	on	each	round	of	the	game	,	they	can	put	money	into	a	common	pot	,	and	then	the	 experiment 	 er 	 	 double 	 s 	 	what	's	in	there	,	and	then	it	's	all	divided	among	the	players	.
So	it	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	nice	analog	for	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	environmental	issues	,	where	we	're	 as 	 king 	 	people	to	make	a	sacrifice	and	they	themselves	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	benefit	from	their	own	sacrifice	.
But	you	 re 	 ally 	 	want	everybody	else	to	sacrifice	,	but	everybody	has	a	 tempt 	 ation 	 	to	a	free	ride	.
And	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	that	,	at	first	,	people	start	off	 reason 	 ably 	 	cooperative	--	and	this	is	all	played	 anonymous 	 ly 	 	.
On	the	first	round	,	people	give	about	half	of	the	money	that	they	can	.
But	they	quickly	see	,	``	You	know	what	,	other	people	are	n't	 do 	 ing 	 	so	much	though	.
I	do	n't	want	to	be	a	sucker	.	I	'm	not	going	to	 cooperat 	 e 	 	.	''
And	so	cooperation	quickly	 decay 	 s 	 	from	 reason 	 ably 	 	good	,	down	to	close	to	zero	.
But	then	--	and	here	's	the	trick	--	Fehr	and	 G 	 achter 	 	said	,	on	the	seventh	round	,	they	told	people	,	``	You	know	what	?	New	rule	.
If	you	want	to	give	some	of	your	own	money	to	punish	people	who	are	n't	 contribut 	 ing 	 	,	you	can	do	that	.	''
And	as	soon	as	people	heard	about	the	punishment	issue	going	on	,	cooperation	shoots	up	.
It	shoots	up	and	it	keeps	going	up	.
There	's	a	lot	of	research	showing	that	to	solve	cooperative	problems	,	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 help 	 s 	 	.
It	's	not	enough	to	just	appeal	to	people	's	good	motives	.
It	 re 	 ally 	 	 help 	 s 	 	to	have	some	sort	of	punishment	.
Even	if	it	's	just	shame	or	 embarrass 	 ment 	 	or	gossip	,	you	need	some	sort	of	punishment	to	bring	people	,	when	they	're	in	large	groups	,	to	 cooperat 	 e 	 	.
There	's	even	some	recent	research	 suggest 	 ing 	 	that	religion	--	priming	God	,	making	people	think	about	God	--	often	,	in	some	 situation 	 s 	 	,	leads	to	more	cooperative	,	more	 pro 	 - 	 social 	 	behavior	.
Some	people	think	that	religion	is	an	adaptation	evolved	both	by	cultural	and	biological	evolution	to	make	groups	to	cohere	,	in	part	for	the	purpose	of	 trust 	 ing 	 	each	other	,	and	then	being	more	effective	at	 compet 	 ing 	 	with	other	groups	.
I	think	that	's	probably	right	,	although	this	is	a	 controversia 	 l 	 	issue	.
But	I	'm	 particular 	 ly 	 	interested	in	religion	,	and	the	origin	of	religion	,	and	in	what	it	does	to	us	and	for	us	.
Because	I	think	that	the	greatest	wonder	in	the	world	is	not	the	Grand	Canyon	.
The	Grand	Canyon	is	 re 	 ally 	 	simple	.
It	's	just	a	lot	of	rock	,	and	then	a	lot	of	water	and	wind	,	and	a	lot	of	time	,	and	you	get	the	Grand	Canyon	.
It	's	not	that	complicated	.
This	is	what	's	 re 	 ally 	 	complicated	,	that	there	were	people	living	in	places	like	the	Grand	Canyon	,	 cooperat 	 ing 	 	with	each	other	,	or	on	the	 savannah 	 s 	 	of	Africa	,	or	on	the	frozen	 shore 	 s 	 	of	Alaska	,	and	then	some	of	these	villages	grew	into	the	mighty	cities	of	Babylon	,	and	Rome	,	and	Tenochtitlan	.
How	did	this	happen	?
This	is	an	absolute	miracle	,	much	 hard 	 er 	 	to	explain	than	the	Grand	Canyon	.
The	answer	,	I	think	,	is	that	they	used	every	tool	in	the	toolbox	.
It	took	all	of	our	moral	psychology	to	create	these	cooperative	groups	.
Yes	,	you	do	need	to	be	concerned	about	harm	,	you	do	need	a	psychology	of	justice	.
But	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 help 	 s 	 	to	organize	a	group	if	you	can	have	 sub 	 - 	 groups 	 	,	and	if	those	 sub 	 - 	 groups 	 	have	some	internal	structure	,	and	if	you	have	some	ideology	that	 tell 	 s 	 	people	to	suppress	their	 carnal 	 ity 	 	,	to	pursue	higher	,	 noble 	 r 	 	ends	.
And	now	we	get	to	the	crux	of	the	 dis 	 agreement 	 	between	 liberal 	 s 	 	and	 conservative 	 s 	 	.
Because	 liberal 	 s 	 	reject	three	of	these	 foundation 	 s 	 	.
They	say	``	No	,	let	's	 celebrat 	 e 	 	diversity	,	not	common	 in 	 - 	 group 	 	membership	.	''
They	say	,	``	Let	's	question	authority	.	''
And	they	say	,	``	Keep	your	laws	off	my	body	.	''
 Liberal 	 s 	 	have	very	noble	motives	for	 do 	 ing 	 	this	.
Traditional	authority	,	traditional	morality	can	be	quite	 re 	 pressive 	 	,	and	 restrict 	 ive 	 	to	those	at	the	bottom	,	to	women	,	to	people	that	do	n't	fit	in	.
So	 liberal 	 s 	 	speak	for	the	weak	and	 oppress 	 ed 	 	.
They	want	change	and	justice	,	even	at	the	risk	of	chaos	.
This	guy	's	shirt	says	,	``	Stop	 bitch 	 ing 	 	,	start	a	revolution	.	''
If	you	're	high	in	 open 	 ness 	 	to	experience	,	revolution	is	good	,	it	's	change	,	it	's	fun	.
 Conservative 	 s 	 	,	on	the	other	hand	,	speak	for	institutions	and	traditions	.
They	want	order	,	even	at	some	cost	to	those	at	the	bottom	.
The	great	conservative	insight	is	that	order	is	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	to	achieve	.
It	's	 re 	 ally 	 	precious	,	and	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	easy	to	lose	.
So	as	Edmund	Burke	said	,	``	The	 restraint 	 s 	 	on	men	,	as	well	as	their	 libert 	 ies 	 	,	are	to	be	 reckon 	 ed 	 	among	their	rights	.	''
This	was	after	the	chaos	of	the	French	Revolution	.
So	once	you	see	this	--	once	you	see	that	 liberal 	 s 	 	and	 conservative 	 s 	 	both	have	something	to	 contribut 	 e 	 	,	that	they	form	a	balance	on	change	versus	stability	--	then	I	think	the	way	is	open	to	step	outside	the	moral	matrix	.
This	is	the	great	insight	that	all	the	Asian	religions	have	 attain 	 ed 	 	.
Think	about	yin	and	yang	.
Yin	and	yang	are	n't	enemies	.	Yin	and	yang	do	n't	hate	each	other	.
Yin	and	yang	are	both	necessary	,	like	night	and	day	,	for	the	functioning	of	the	world	.
You	find	the	same	thing	in	Hinduism	.
There	are	many	high	gods	in	Hinduism	.
Two	of	them	are	Vishnu	,	the	 pre 	 server 	 	,	and	Shiva	,	the	destroyer	.
This	image	actually	is	both	of	those	gods	sharing	the	same	body	.
You	have	the	 marking 	 s 	 	of	Vishnu	on	the	left	,	so	we	could	think	of	Vishnu	as	the	conservative	god	.
You	have	the	 marking 	 s 	 	of	Shiva	on	the	right	,	Shiva	's	the	liberal	god	.	And	they	work	together	.
You	find	the	same	thing	in	Buddhism	.
These	two	 stanza 	 s 	 	contain	,	I	think	,	the	 deep 	 est 	 	 insight 	 s 	 	that	have	ever	been	 attain 	 ed 	 	into	moral	psychology	.
From	the	Zen	master	 Seng 	 - 	 ts 	 'an 	 	:	``	If	you	want	the	truth	to	stand	clear	before	you	,	never	be	for	or	against	.
The	struggle	between	for	and	against	is	the	mind	's	worst	disease	.	''
Now	 unfortunat 	 ely 	 	,	it	's	a	disease	that	has	been	caught	by	many	of	the	world	's	leaders	.
But	before	you	feel	superior	to	George	Bush	,	before	you	throw	a	stone	,	ask	yourself	,	do	you	accept	this	?
Do	you	accept	stepping	out	of	the	battle	of	good	and	evil	?
Can	you	be	not	for	or	against	anything	?
So	,	what	's	the	point	?	What	should	you	do	?
Well	,	if	you	take	the	greatest	 insight 	 s 	 	from	ancient	Asian	 philosophie 	 s 	 	and	religions	,	and	you	 combin 	 e 	 	them	with	the	latest	research	on	moral	psychology	,	I	think	you	come	to	these	 conclusion 	 s 	 	:	that	our	righteous	minds	were	designed	by	evolution	to	unite	us	into	teams	,	to	divide	us	against	other	teams	and	then	to	blind	us	to	the	truth	.
So	what	should	you	do	?	Am	I	telling	you	to	not	 s 	 trive 	 	?
Am	I	telling	you	to	embrace	 Seng 	 - 	 ts 	 'an 	 	and	stop	,	stop	with	this	struggle	of	for	and	against	?
No	,	 absolute 	 ly 	 	not	.	I	'm	not	saying	that	.
This	is	an	amazing	group	of	people	who	are	 do 	 ing 	 	so	much	,	 us 	 ing 	 	so	much	of	their	talent	,	their	 brilli 	 ance 	 	,	their	energy	,	their	money	,	to	make	the	world	a	better	place	,	to	fight	--	to	fight	 wrong 	 s 	 	,	to	solve	problems	.
But	as	we	learned	from	Samantha	Power	,	in	her	story	about	Sergio	Vieira	de	Mello	,	you	ca	n't	just	go	charging	in	,	saying	,	``	You	're	wrong	,	and	I	'm	right	.	''
Because	,	as	we	just	heard	,	everybody	 think 	 s 	 	they	are	right	.
A	lot	of	the	problems	we	have	to	solve	are	problems	that	require	us	to	change	other	people	.
And	if	you	want	to	change	other	people	,	a	much	better	way	to	do	it	is	to	first	understand	who	we	are	--	understand	our	moral	psychology	,	understand	that	we	all	think	we	're	right	--	and	then	step	out	,	even	if	it	's	just	for	a	moment	,	step	out	--	check	in	with	 Seng 	 - 	 ts 	 'an 	 	.
Step	out	of	the	moral	matrix	,	just	try	to	see	it	as	a	struggle	playing	out	,	in	which	everybody	does	think	they	're	right	,	and	everybody	,	at	least	,	has	some	reasons	--	even	if	you	disagree	with	them	--	everybody	has	some	reasons	for	what	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	.
Step	out	.
And	if	you	do	that	,	that	's	the	essential	move	to	 cultivat 	 e 	 	moral	 humil 	 ity 	 	,	to	get	yourself	out	of	this	 self 	 - 	 righteous 	 ness 	 	,	which	is	the	normal	human	condition	.
Think	about	the	Dalai	Lama	.
Think	about	the	 e 	 normous 	 	moral	authority	of	the	Dalai	Lama	--	and	it	comes	from	his	moral	 humil 	 ity 	 	.
So	I	think	the	point	--	the	point	of	my	talk	,	and	I	think	the	point	of	TED	--	is	that	this	is	a	group	that	is	 passionate 	 ly 	 	engaged	in	the	pursuit	of	changing	the	world	for	the	better	.
People	here	are	 passionate 	 ly 	 	engaged	in	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	the	world	a	better	place	.
But	there	is	also	a	passionate	commitment	to	the	truth	.
And	so	I	think	that	the	answer	is	to	use	that	passionate	commitment	to	the	truth	to	try	to	turn	it	into	a	better	future	for	us	all	.
Thank	you	.

America	was	built	by	makers	--	curious	,	enthusiastic	amateur	 inventor 	 s 	 	whose	 tinker 	 ing 	 	habit	 spark 	 ed 	 	whole	new	industries	.	At	TED	@	 Motor 	 City 	 	,	MAKE	magazine	publisher	Dale	Dougherty	says	we	're	all	makers	at	heart	,	and	shows	cool	new	tools	to	tinker	with	,	like	 Arduin 	 os 	 	,	affordable	3D	printers	,	even	DIY	satellites	.

Dale	Dougherty	:	We	are	makers
I	'm	going	to	have	a	pretty	simple	idea	that	I	'm	just	going	to	tell	you	over	and	over	until	I	get	you	to	believe	it	,	and	that	is	all	of	us	are	makers	.
I	 re 	 ally 	 	believe	that	.
All	of	us	are	makers	.
We	're	born	makers	.
We	have	this	ability	to	make	things	,	to	grasp	things	with	our	hands	.
We	use	words	like	``	grasp	''	 metaphor 	 ically 	 	to	also	think	about	understanding	things	.
We	do	n't	just	live	,	but	we	make	.
We	create	things	.
Well	I	'm	going	to	show	you	a	group	of	makers	from	Maker	Faire	and	various	places	.
It	does	n't	come	out	 particular 	 ly 	 	well	,	but	that	's	a	 particular 	 ly 	 	tall	bicycle	.
It	's	a	scraper	bike	;	it	's	called	--	from	Oakland	.
And	this	is	a	 particular 	 ly 	 	small	scooter	for	a	gentleman	of	this	size	.
But	he	's	 try 	 ing 	 	to	power	it	,	or	 motor 	 ize 	 	it	,	with	a	drill	.
And	the	question	he	had	is	,	``	Can	I	do	it	?	Can	it	be	done	?	''
Apparently	it	can	.
So	makers	are	 enthusiast 	 s 	 	;	they	're	 amateur 	 s 	 	;	they	're	people	who	love	 do 	 ing 	 	what	they	do	.
They	do	n't	always	even	know	why	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
We	have	begun	organizing	makers	at	our	Maker	Faire	.
There	was	one	held	in	Detroit	here	last	summer	,	and	it	will	be	held	again	next	summer	,	at	the	Henry	Ford	.
But	we	hold	them	in	San	Francisco	--	--	and	in	New	York	.
And	it	's	a	fabulous	event	to	just	meet	and	talk	to	these	people	who	make	things	and	are	there	to	just	show	them	to	you	and	talk	about	them	and	have	a	great	conversation	.
Guy	:	I	might	get	one	of	those	.
Dale	Dougherty	:	These	are	electric	 muffin 	 s 	 	.
Guy	:	Where	did	you	guys	get	those	?
Muffin	:	Will	you	glide	with	us	?
DD	:	I	know	Ford	has	new	electric	vehicles	coming	out	.
We	got	there	first	.
Lady	:	Will	you	glide	with	us	?
DD	:	This	is	something	I	call	``	swinging	in	the	rain	.	''
And	you	can	 bare 	 ly 	 	see	it	,	but	it	's	--	a	controller	at	top	cycles	the	water	to	fall	just	before	and	after	you	pass	through	the	bottom	of	the	arc	.
So	imagine	a	kid	:	``	Am	I	going	to	get	wet	?	Am	I	going	to	get	wet	?
No	,	I	did	n't	get	wet	.	Am	I	going	to	get	wet	?	Am	I	going	to	get	wet	?	''
That	's	the	experience	of	a	clever	ride	.
And	of	course	,	we	have	fashion	.
People	are	 re 	 making 	 	things	into	fashion	.
I	do	n't	know	if	this	is	called	a	 basket 	 - 	 bra 	 	,	but	it	ought	to	be	something	like	that	.
We	have	art	students	getting	together	,	taking	old	radiator	parts	and	 do 	 ing 	 	an	 iron 	 - 	 pour 	 	to	make	something	new	out	of	it	.
They	did	that	in	the	summer	,	and	it	was	very	warm	.
Now	this	one	takes	a	little	bit	of	 explain 	 ing 	 	.
You	know	what	those	are	,	right	?
 Billy 	 - 	 Bob 	 	,	or	Billy	Bass	,	or	something	like	that	.
Now	the	background	is	--	the	guy	who	did	this	is	a	physicist	.
And	here	he	'll	explain	a	little	bit	about	what	it	does	.
Richard	Carter	:	I	'm	Richard	Carter	,	and	this	is	the	 Sashi 	 mi 	 	 Tabernacl 	 e 	 	Choir	.
Choir	:	♫	When	you	hold	me	in	your	arms	♫	DD	:	This	is	all	 computer 	 - 	 controlled 	 	in	an	old	Volvo	.
Choir	:	♫	I	'm	hooked	on	a	 feel 	 in 	 	'	♫	♫	I	'm	high	on	 believ 	 in 	 	'	♫	♫	That	you	're	in	love	with	me	♫	DD	:	So	Richard	came	up	from	Houston	last	year	to	visit	us	in	Detroit	here	and	show	the	wonderful	 Sashi 	 mi 	 	 Tabernacl 	 e 	 	Choir	.
So	,	are	you	a	maker	?
How	many	people	here	would	say	you	're	a	maker	,	if	you	raise	your	hand	?
That	's	a	pretty	good	--	but	there	's	some	of	you	out	there	that	wo	n't	admit	that	you	're	makers	.
And	again	,	think	about	it	.
You	're	makers	of	food	;	you	're	makers	of	shelter	;	you	're	makers	of	lots	of	different	things	,	and	 part 	 ly 	 	what	interests	me	today	is	you	're	makers	of	your	own	world	,	and	 particular 	 ly 	 	the	role	that	technology	has	in	your	life	.
You	're	 re 	 ally 	 	a	driver	or	a	passenger	--	to	use	a	Volkswagen	phrase	.
Makers	are	in	control	.
That	's	what	 fascina 	 tes 	 	them	.	That	's	why	they	do	what	they	do	.
They	want	to	figure	out	how	things	work	;	they	want	to	get	access	to	it	;	and	they	want	to	control	it	.
They	want	to	use	it	to	their	own	purpose	.
Makers	today	,	to	some	degree	,	are	out	on	the	edge	.
They	're	not	mainstream	.
They	're	a	little	bit	radical	.
They	're	a	bit	subversive	in	what	they	do	.
But	at	one	time	,	it	was	 fair 	 ly 	 	 common 	 place 	 	to	think	of	yourself	as	a	maker	.
It	was	not	something	you	'd	even	remark	upon	.
And	I	found	this	old	video	.
And	I	'll	tell	you	more	about	it	,	but	just	...
Narrator	:	Of	all	things	Americans	are	,	we	are	makers	.
With	our	 strength 	 s 	 	and	our	minds	and	spirit	,	we	gather	,	we	form	,	and	we	fashion	.
Makers	and	shapers	and	 put 	 - 	 it 	 - 	 together 	 ers 	 	.
DD	:	So	it	goes	on	to	show	you	people	making	things	out	of	wood	,	a	grandfather	making	a	ship	in	a	bottle	,	a	woman	making	a	pie	--	somewhat	standard	fare	of	the	day	.
But	it	was	a	sense	of	pride	that	we	made	things	,	that	the	world	around	us	was	made	by	us	.
It	did	n't	just	exist	.
We	made	it	,	and	we	were	connected	to	it	that	way	.
And	I	think	that	's	 tremend 	 ously 	 	important	.
Now	I	'm	going	to	tell	you	one	funny	thing	about	this	.
This	particular	reel	--	it	's	an	industrial	video	--	but	it	was	shown	in	 drive 	 - 	 in 	 	 theater 	 s 	 	in	1961	--	in	the	Detroit	area	,	in	fact	--	and	it	preceded	Alfred	Hitchcock	's	``	Psycho	.	''
So	I	like	to	think	there	was	something	going	on	there	of	the	new	generation	of	makers	coming	out	of	this	,	plus	``	Psycho	.	''
This	is	Andrew	Archer	.
I	met	Andrew	at	one	of	our	community	meetings	putting	together	Maker	Faire	.
Andrew	had	moved	to	Detroit	from	Duluth	,	Minnesota	.
And	I	talked	to	his	mom	,	and	I	ended	up	 do 	 ing 	 	a	story	on	him	for	a	magazine	called	 Kid 	 robot 	 	.
He	's	just	a	kid	that	grew	up	playing	with	tools	instead	of	toys	.
He	 like 	 d 	 	to	take	things	apart	.
His	mother	gave	him	a	part	of	the	garage	,	and	he	collected	things	from	yard	sales	,	and	he	made	stuff	.
And	then	he	did	n't	 particular 	 ly 	 	like	school	that	much	,	but	he	got	involved	in	robotics	competitions	,	and	he	 re 	 alized 	 	he	had	a	talent	,	and	,	more	 important 	 ly 	 	,	he	had	a	real	passion	for	it	.
And	he	began	building	robots	.
And	when	I	sat	down	next	to	him	,	he	was	telling	me	about	a	company	he	formed	,	and	he	was	building	some	robots	for	automobile	factories	to	move	things	around	on	the	factory	floor	.
And	that	's	why	he	moved	to	Michigan	.
But	he	also	moved	here	to	meet	other	people	 do 	 ing 	 	what	he	's	 do 	 ing 	 	.
And	this	kind	of	 get 	 s 	 	to	this	important	idea	today	.
This	is	Jeff	and	Bilal	and	several	others	here	in	a	 hacker 	 space 	 	.
And	there	's	about	three	 hacker 	 spaces 	 	or	more	in	Detroit	.
And	there	's	probably	even	some	new	ones	since	I	've	been	here	last	.
But	these	are	like	clubs	--	they	're	sharing	tools	,	sharing	space	,	sharing	expertise	in	what	to	make	.
And	so	it	's	a	very	 interest 	 ing 	 	phenomenon	that	's	going	across	the	world	.
But	 essential 	 ly 	 	these	are	people	that	are	playing	with	technology	.
Let	me	say	that	again	:	playing	.
They	do	n't	 necessar 	 ily 	 	know	what	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	or	why	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
They	're	playing	to	discover	what	the	technology	can	do	,	and	probably	to	discover	what	they	can	do	themselves	,	what	their	own	capabilities	are	.
Now	the	other	thing	that	I	think	is	taking	off	,	another	reason	making	is	taking	off	today	,	is	there	's	some	great	new	tools	out	there	.
And	you	ca	n't	see	this	very	well	on	the	screen	,	but	 Arduin 	 o 	 	--	 Arduin 	 o 	 	is	an	 open 	 - 	 source 	 	hardware	platform	.
It	's	a	 micro 	 - 	 controller 	 	.
If	you	do	n't	know	what	those	are	,	they	're	just	the	``	brains	.	''
So	they	're	the	brains	of	maker	projects	,	and	here	's	an	example	of	one	.
And	I	do	n't	know	if	you	can	see	it	that	well	,	but	that	's	a	 mail 	 box 	 	--	so	an	ordinary	 mail 	 box 	 	and	an	 Arduin 	 o 	 	.
So	you	figure	out	how	to	program	this	,	and	you	put	this	in	your	 mail 	 box 	 	.
And	when	someone	opens	your	 mail 	 box 	 	,	you	get	a	notification	,	an	alert	message	goes	to	your	iPhone	.
Now	that	could	be	a	dog	door	,	it	could	be	someone	going	 s 	 omewhere 	 	where	they	should	n't	,	like	a	little	brother	into	a	little	sister	's	room	.
There	's	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	different	things	that	you	can	imagine	for	that	.
Now	here	's	something	--	a	3D	printer	.
That	's	another	tool	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	taken	off	--	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
This	is	 Maker 	 bot 	 	.
And	there	are	industrial	versions	of	this	--	about	20,000	dollars	.
These	guys	came	up	with	a	kit	version	for	750	dollars	,	and	that	means	that	 hobbyist 	 s 	 	and	ordinary	folks	can	get	a	hold	of	this	and	begin	playing	with	3D	printers	.
Now	they	do	n't	know	what	they	want	to	do	with	it	,	but	they	're	going	to	figure	it	out	.
They	will	only	figure	it	out	by	getting	their	hands	on	it	and	playing	with	it	.
One	of	the	 cool 	 est 	 	things	is	,	 Maker 	 bot 	 	sent	out	an	upgrade	,	some	new	brackets	for	the	box	.
Well	you	printed	out	the	brackets	and	then	replaced	the	old	brackets	with	the	new	ones	.
Is	n't	that	cool	?
So	makers	harvest	technology	from	all	the	places	around	us	.
This	is	a	radar	speed	detector	that	was	developed	from	a	Hot	Wheels	toy	.
And	they	do	 interest 	 ing 	 	things	.
They	're	 re 	 ally 	 	creating	new	areas	and	 explor 	 ing 	 	areas	that	you	might	only	think	--	the	military	is	 do 	 ing 	 	drones	--	well	,	there	is	a	whole	community	of	people	building	autonomous	 airplane 	 s 	 	,	or	vehicles	--	something	that	you	could	program	to	fly	on	its	own	,	without	a	stick	or	anything	,	to	figure	out	what	path	it	's	going	.
 Fascina 	 ting 	 	work	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	.
We	just	had	an	issue	on	space	exploration	,	DIY	space	exploration	.
This	is	probably	the	best	time	in	the	history	of	 man 	 kind 	 	to	love	space	.
You	could	build	your	own	satellite	and	get	it	into	space	for	like	8,000	dollars	.
Think	how	much	money	and	how	many	years	it	took	NASA	to	get	satellites	into	space	.
In	fact	,	these	guys	actually	work	for	NASA	,	and	they	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	pioneer	 us 	 ing 	 	 off 	 - 	 the 	 - 	 shelf 	 	components	,	cheap	things	that	are	n't	specialized	that	they	can	 combin 	 e 	 	and	send	up	into	space	.
Makers	are	a	source	of	innovation	,	and	I	think	it	 relate 	 s 	 	back	to	something	like	the	birth	of	the	personal	computer	industry	.
This	is	Steve	Wozniak	.	Where	does	he	learn	about	computers	?
It	's	the	Homebrew	Computer	Club	--	just	like	a	 hacker 	 space 	 	.
And	he	says	,	``	I	could	go	there	all	day	long	and	talk	to	people	and	share	ideas	for	free	.	''
Well	he	did	a	little	bit	better	than	free	.
But	it	's	important	to	understand	that	a	lot	of	the	origins	of	our	industries	--	even	like	Henry	Ford	--	come	from	this	idea	of	playing	and	figuring	things	out	in	groups	.
Well	,	if	I	have	n't	 convinc 	 ed 	 	you	that	you	're	a	maker	,	I	hope	I	could	 convinc 	 e 	 	you	that	our	next	generation	should	be	makers	,	that	kids	are	 particular 	 ly 	 	interested	in	this	,	in	this	ability	to	control	the	physical	world	and	be	able	to	use	things	like	 micro 	 - 	 controller 	 s 	 	and	build	robots	.
And	we	've	got	to	get	this	into	schools	,	or	into	communities	in	many	,	many	ways	--	the	ability	to	tinker	,	to	shape	and	 re 	 shape 	 	the	world	around	us	.
There	's	a	great	opportunity	today	--	and	that	's	what	I	 re 	 ally 	 	care	about	the	most	.
An	the	answer	to	the	question	:	what	will	America	make	?

Virginia	 Post 	 rel 	 	on	glamour
You	might	be	 wonder 	 ing 	 	why	I	'm	wearing	sunglasses	,	and	one	answer	to	that	is	,	because	I	'm	here	to	talk	about	glamour	.
So	,	we	all	think	we	know	what	glamour	is	.	Here	it	is	.
It	's	glamorous	movie	stars	,	like	Marlene	Dietrich	.
And	it	comes	in	a	male	form	,	too	--	very	glamorous	.
Not	only	can	he	shoot	,	drive	,	drink	--	you	know	,	he	drinks	wine	,	there	actually	is	a	little	wine	in	there	--	and	of	course	,	always	 wear 	 s 	 	a	tuxedo	.
But	I	think	that	glamour	actually	has	a	much	 broad 	 er 	 	meaning	--	one	that	is	true	for	the	movie	stars	and	the	fictional	characters	,	but	also	comes	in	other	forms	.
A	magazine	?
Well	,	it	's	 certain 	 ly 	 	not	this	one	.
This	is	the	least	glamorous	magazine	on	the	 news 	 stand 	 	--	it	's	all	about	sex	tips	.
Sex	tips	are	not	glamorous	.
And	Drew	 Barry 	 more 	 	,	for	all	her	wonderful	charm	,	is	not	glamorous	either	.
But	there	is	a	glamour	of	industry	.
This	is	Margaret	 Bourke 	 - 	 White 	 	's	--	one	of	her	pictures	she	did	.
Fantastic	,	glamorous	pictures	of	steel	mills	and	paper	mills	and	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	glamorous	industrial	places	.
And	there	's	the	mythic	glamour	of	the	garage	entrepreneur	.
This	is	the	 Hewlett 	 - 	 Packard 	 	garage	.
We	know	everyone	who	starts	a	business	in	a	garage	ends	up	founding	 Hewlett 	 - 	 Packard 	 	.
There	's	the	glamour	of	physics	.
What	could	be	more	glamorous	than	understanding	the	entire	universe	,	grand	unification	?	And	,	by	the	way	,	it	 help 	 s 	 	if	you	're	Brian	Greene	--	he	has	other	 kind 	 s 	 	of	glamour	.
And	there	is	,	of	course	,	this	glamour	.
This	is	very	,	very	glamorous	:	the	glamour	of	outer	space	--	and	not	the	 alien 	 - 	 style 	 	glamour	,	but	the	nice	,	clean	,	early	'60s	version	.
So	what	do	we	mean	by	glamour	?
Well	,	one	thing	you	can	do	if	you	want	to	know	what	glamour	means	is	you	can	look	in	the	dictionary	.
And	it	actually	 help 	 s 	 	a	lot	more	if	you	look	in	a	very	old	dictionary	,	in	this	case	the	1913	dictionary	.
Because	for	centuries	,	glamour	had	a	very	particular	meaning	,	and	the	word	was	actually	used	 different 	 ly 	 	from	the	way	we	think	of	it	.
You	had	``	a	''	glamour	.
It	was	n't	glamour	as	a	quality	--	you	``	cast	a	glamour	.	''
Glamour	was	a	literal	magic	spell	.
Not	a	 metaphor 	 ical 	 	one	,	the	way	we	use	it	today	,	but	a	literal	magic	spell	associated	with	 witch 	 es 	 	and	 gypsie 	 s 	 	and	to	some	extent	,	Celtic	magic	.
And	over	the	years	,	around	the	turn	of	the	20th	century	,	it	started	to	take	on	this	other	kind	of	deception	--	this	definition	for	any	artificial	interest	in	,	or	association	with	,	an	object	through	which	it	appears	 delu 	 sively 	 	 magnifie 	 d 	 	or	glorified	.
But	still	,	glamour	is	an	illusion	.
Glamour	is	a	magic	spell	.
And	there	's	something	dangerous	about	glamour	throughout	most	of	history	.	When	the	 witch 	 es 	 	cast	a	magic	spell	on	you	,	it	was	not	in	your	 self 	 - 	 interest 	 	--	it	was	to	get	you	to	act	against	your	interest	.
Well	of	course	,	in	the	20th	century	,	glamour	came	to	have	this	different	meaning	associated	with	Hollywood	.
And	this	is	Hedy	 Lamar 	 r 	 	.
Hedy	 Lamar 	 r 	 	said	,	``	Anyone	can	look	glamorous	,	all	you	have	to	do	is	sit	there	and	look	stupid	.	''
But	in	fact	,	with	all	due	respect	to	Hedy	--	about	whom	we	'll	hear	more	later	--	there	's	a	lot	more	to	it	.
There	was	a	 tremend 	 ous 	 	amount	of	technical	achievement	associated	with	creating	this	Hollywood	glamour	.
There	were	scores	of	 retouch 	 ers 	 	and	lighting	experts	and	 make 	 - 	 up 	 	experts	.
You	can	go	to	the	museum	of	Hollywood	history	in	Hollywood	and	see	Max	Factor	's	special	rooms	that	he	painted	different	colors	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	the	 complex 	 ion 	 	of	the	star	he	was	going	to	make	up	.
So	you	've	got	this	highly	stylized	portrait	of	something	that	was	not	 entire 	 ly 	 	of	this	earth	--	it	was	a	portrait	of	a	star	.
And	actually	,	we	see	 glamor 	 ized 	 	photos	of	stars	all	the	time	--	they	call	them	false	color	.
Glamour	is	a	form	of	 fals 	 ification 	 	,	but	 fals 	 ification 	 	to	achieve	a	particular	purpose	.
It	may	be	to	 illuminat 	 e 	 	the	star	;	it	may	be	to	sell	a	film	.
And	it	 involve 	 s 	 	a	great	deal	of	technique	.
It	's	not	--	glamour	is	not	something	--	you	do	n't	wake	up	in	the	morning	glamorous	.	I	do	n't	care	who	you	are	.
Even	Nicole	 Kid 	 man 	 	does	n't	wake	up	in	the	morning	glamorous	.
There	is	a	process	of	``	 ideal 	 ization 	 	,	 glor 	 ification 	 	and	 dramat 	 ization 	 	,	''	and	it	's	not	just	the	case	for	people	.
Glamour	does	n't	have	to	be	people	.
Architectural	photography	--	Julius	Schulman	,	who	has	talked	about	 trans 	 figuration 	 	,	took	this	fabulous	,	famous	picture	of	the	Kauffman	House	.
Architectural	photography	is	 extreme 	 ly 	 	glamorous	.
It	puts	you	into	this	special	,	special	world	.
This	is	Alex	Ross	's	comic	book	art	,	which	appears	to	be	 extreme 	 ly 	 	realistic	,	as	part	of	his	style	is	he	gives	you	a	kind	of	realism	in	his	comic	art	.
Except	that	light	does	n't	work	this	way	in	the	real	world	.
When	you	stack	people	in	rows	,	the	ones	in	the	background	look	 small 	 er 	 	than	the	ones	in	the	 fore 	 ground 	 	--	but	not	in	the	world	of	glamour	.
What	glamour	is	all	about	--	I	took	this	from	a	blurb	in	the	table	of	 content 	 s 	 	of	New	York	magazine	,	which	was	telling	us	that	glamour	is	back	--	glamour	is	all	about	 transcend 	 ing 	 	the	everyday	.
And	I	think	that	that	's	starting	to	get	at	what	the	core	that	 combin 	 es 	 	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	glamour	is	.
This	is	 Filippin 	 o 	 	Lippi	's	1543	portrait	of	Saint	 Apolloni 	 a 	 	.
And	I	do	n't	know	who	she	is	either	,	but	this	is	the	[	16th	]	century	equivalent	of	a	 super 	 model 	 	.
It	's	a	very	glamorous	portrait	.
Why	is	it	glamorous	?
It	's	glamorous	,	first	,	because	she	is	beautiful	--	but	that	does	not	make	you	glamorous	,	that	only	makes	you	beautiful	.
She	is	graceful	,	she	is	mysterious	and	she	is	transcendent	,	and	those	are	the	central	qualities	of	glamour	.
You	do	n't	see	her	eyes	;	they	're	looking	 down 	 ward 	 	.
She	's	not	looking	away	from	you	 exact 	 ly 	 	,	but	you	have	to	 ment 	 ally 	 	imagine	her	world	.
She	's	 encourag 	 ing 	 	you	to	 contempla 	 te 	 	this	higher	world	to	which	she	 belong 	 s 	 	,	where	she	can	be	 complete 	 ly 	 	tranquil	while	holding	the	iron	instruments	of	her	death	by	torture	.
Mel	Gibson	's	``	Passion	Of	The	Christ	''	--	not	glamorous	.
That	's	glamour	:	that	's	Michelangelo	's	``	Pieta	,	''	where	Mary	is	the	same	age	as	Jesus	and	they	're	both	 awful 	 ly 	 	happy	and	pleasant	.
Glamour	 invite 	 s 	 	us	to	live	in	a	different	world	.
It	has	to	 simultaneous 	 ly 	 	be	mysterious	,	a	little	bit	distant	--	that	's	why	,	often	in	these	glamour	shots	,	the	person	is	not	looking	at	the	audience	,	it	's	why	sunglasses	are	glamorous	--	but	also	not	so	far	above	us	that	we	ca	n't	identify	with	the	person	.
In	some	sense	,	there	has	to	be	something	like	us	.
So	as	I	say	,	in	religious	art	,	you	know	,	God	is	not	glamorous	.
God	can	not	be	glamorous	because	God	is	omnipotent	,	omniscient	--	too	far	above	us	.
And	yet	you	will	see	in	religious	art	,	saints	or	the	Virgin	Mary	will	often	be	 portray 	 ed 	 	--	not	always	--	in	glamorous	forms	.
As	I	said	earlier	,	glamour	does	not	have	to	be	about	people	,	but	it	has	to	have	this	transcendent	quality	.
What	is	it	about	Superman	?
Aside	from	Alex	Ross	's	style	,	which	is	very	glamorous	,	one	thing	about	Superman	is	he	makes	you	believe	that	a	man	can	fly	.
Glamour	is	all	about	 transcend 	 ing 	 	this	world	and	getting	to	an	 idealiz 	 ed 	 	,	perfect	place	.
And	this	is	one	reason	that	modes	of	transportation	tend	to	be	 extreme 	 ly 	 	glamorous	.
The	less	experience	we	have	with	them	,	the	more	glamorous	they	are	.
So	you	can	do	a	 glamor 	 ized 	 	picture	of	a	car	,	but	you	ca	n't	do	a	 glamor 	 ized 	 	picture	of	traffic	.
You	can	do	a	 glamor 	 ized 	 	picture	of	an	airplane	,	but	not	the	inside	.
The	notion	is	that	it	's	going	to	transport	you	,	and	the	story	is	not	about	,	you	know	,	the	guy	in	front	of	you	in	the	airplane	,	who	has	this	nasty	little	kid	,	or	the	big	cough	.
The	story	is	about	where	you	're	 arriv 	 ing 	 	,	or	thinking	about	where	you	're	 arriv 	 ing 	 	.
And	this	sense	of	being	 transport 	 ed 	 	is	one	reason	that	we	have	glamour	styling	.
This	sort	of	 streamlin 	 ing 	 	styling	is	not	just	glamorous	because	we	associate	it	with	movies	of	that	period	,	but	because	,	in	it	's	 streamlin 	 ing 	 	,	it	 transport 	 s 	 	us	from	the	everyday	.
The	same	thing	--	arches	are	very	glamorous	.
Arches	with	stained	glass	--	even	more	glamorous	.
 Staircase 	 s 	 	that	curve	away	from	you	are	glamorous	.
I	happen	to	find	that	particular	staircase	picture	very	glamorous	because	,	to	me	,	it	 capture 	 s 	 	the	whole	promise	of	the	academic	 contempla 	 tive 	 	life	--	but	maybe	that	's	because	I	went	to	Princeton	.
Anyway	,	 skyline 	 s 	 	are	super	glamorous	,	city	streets	--	not	so	glamorous	.
You	know	,	when	you	get	,	actually	to	this	town	it	has	reality	.
The	horizon	,	the	open	road	,	is	very	,	very	glamorous	.
There	are	few	things	more	glamorous	than	the	horizon	--	except	,	possibly	,	multiple	 horizon 	 s 	 	.
Of	course	,	here	you	do	n't	feel	the	cold	,	or	the	heat	--	you	just	see	the	 possibilit 	 ies 	 	.
In	order	to	pull	glamour	off	,	you	need	this	Renaissance	quality	of	 s 	 pre 	 zza 	 tura 	 	,	which	is	a	term	 coin 	 ed 	 	by	 Castiglion 	 e 	 	in	his	book	,	``	The	Book	Of	The	 Court 	 ier 	 	.	''
There	's	the	 not 	 - 	 glamorous 	 	version	of	what	it	looks	like	today	,	after	a	few	centuries	.
And	 s 	 pre 	 zza 	 tura 	 	is	the	art	that	 conceal 	 s 	 	art	.
It	makes	things	look	 effort 	 less 	 	.
You	do	n't	think	about	how	Nicole	 Kid 	 man 	 	is	maneuvering	that	dress	--	she	just	looks	 complete 	 ly 	 	natural	.
And	I	remember	reading	,	after	the	Lara	Croft	movies	,	how	 Angel 	 ina 	 	 Joli 	 e 	 	would	go	home	 complete 	 ly 	 	black	and	blue	.
Of	course	,	they	covered	that	with	 make 	 - 	 up 	 	,	because	Lara	Croft	did	all	those	same	 stunt 	 s 	 	--	but	she	does	n't	get	black	and	blue	,	because	she	has	 s 	 pre 	 zza 	 tura 	 	.
``	To	conceal	all	art	and	make	whatever	is	done	or	said	appear	to	be	without	effort	''	:	And	this	is	one	of	the	critical	aspects	of	glamour	.
Glamour	is	about	editing	.
How	do	you	create	the	sense	of	 transcend 	 ence 	 	,	the	sense	of	 evo 	 king 	 	a	perfect	world	?
The	sense	of	,	you	know	,	life	could	be	better	,	I	could	join	this	--	I	could	be	a	perfect	person	,	I	could	join	this	perfect	world	.
We	do	n't	tell	you	all	the	 grubb 	 y 	 	details	.
Now	,	this	was	 kind 	 ly 	 	lent	to	me	by	Jeff	 Bezo 	 s 	 	,	from	last	year	.
This	is	 u 	 nderneath 	 	Jeff	's	desk	.
This	is	what	the	real	world	of	computers	,	lamps	,	electrical	appliances	of	all	 kind 	 s 	 	,	looks	like	.
But	if	you	look	in	a	catalog	--	 particular 	 ly 	 	a	catalog	of	modern	,	beautiful	objects	for	your	home	--	it	looks	like	this	.
There	are	no	cords	.
Look	next	time	you	get	these	 catalog 	 s 	 	in	your	mail	--	you	can	usually	figure	out	where	they	hid	the	cord	.
But	there	's	always	this	illusion	that	if	you	buy	this	lamp	,	you	will	live	in	a	world	without	cords	.
And	the	same	thing	is	true	of	,	if	you	buy	this	laptop	or	you	buy	this	computer	--	and	even	in	these	wireless	eras	,	you	do	n't	get	to	live	in	the	world	without	cords	.
You	have	to	have	mystery	and	you	have	to	have	grace	.
And	there	she	is	--	Grace	.
This	is	the	most	glamorous	picture	,	I	think	,	ever	.
Part	of	the	thing	is	that	,	in	``	Rear	Window	,	''	the	question	is	,	is	she	too	glamorous	to	live	in	his	world	?
And	the	answer	is	no	,	but	of	course	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	just	a	movie	.
Here	's	Hedy	 Lamar 	 r 	 	again	.
And	,	you	know	,	this	kind	of	head	covering	is	 extreme 	 ly 	 	glamorous	because	,	like	sunglasses	,	it	 conceal 	 s 	 	and	 reveal 	 s 	 	at	the	same	time	.
 Trans 	 lu 	 cence 	 	is	glamorous	--	that	's	why	all	these	people	wear	 pearl 	 s 	 	.
It	's	why	 bar 	 ware 	 	is	glamorous	.	Glamour	is	translucent	--	not	transparent	,	not	opaque	.
It	 invite 	 s 	 	us	into	the	world	but	it	does	n't	give	us	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	clear	picture	.
And	I	think	if	Grace	Kelly	is	the	most	glamorous	person	,	maybe	a	spiral	staircase	with	glass	block	may	be	the	most	glamorous	interior	shot	,	because	a	spiral	staircase	is	 incredibl 	 y 	 	glamorous	.
It	has	that	sense	of	going	up	and	away	,	and	yet	you	never	think	about	how	you	would	 re 	 ally 	 	trip	if	you	were	--	 particular 	 ly 	 	going	down	.
And	of	course	glass	block	has	that	sense	of	 trans 	 lu 	 cence 	 	.
So	,	this	session	's	 s 	 upposed 	 	to	be	about	pure	pleasure	but	glamour	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 part 	 ly 	 	about	meaning	.
All	 individual 	 s 	 	and	all	cultures	have	 ideal 	 s 	 	that	can	not	possibly	be	 re 	 alized 	 	in	reality	.
They	have	 contradict 	 ions 	 	,	they	uphold	principles	that	are	 incommensur 	 able 	 	with	each	other	--	whatever	it	is	--	and	yet	these	 ideal 	 s 	 	give	meaning	and	purpose	to	our	lives	as	cultures	and	as	 individual 	 s 	 	.
And	the	way	we	deal	with	that	is	we	displace	them	--	we	put	them	into	a	golden	world	,	an	imagined	world	,	an	age	of	heroes	,	the	world	to	come	.
And	in	the	life	of	an	individual	,	we	often	associate	that	with	some	object	.
The	white	picket	fence	,	the	perfect	house	.
The	perfect	kitchen	--	no	bills	on	the	counter	in	the	perfect	kitchen	.
You	know	,	you	buy	that	Viking	range	,	this	is	what	your	kitchen	will	look	like	.
The	perfect	love	life	--	 symbol 	 ized 	 	by	the	perfect	necklace	,	the	perfect	diamond	ring	.
The	perfect	 get 	 away 	 	in	your	perfect	car	.
This	is	an	interior	design	firm	that	is	literally	called	Utopia	.
The	perfect	office	--	again	,	no	cords	,	as	far	as	I	can	tell	.
And	 certain 	 ly 	 	,	no	,	it	does	n't	look	a	thing	like	my	office	.
I	mean	,	there	's	no	paper	on	the	desk	.
We	want	this	golden	world	.
And	some	people	get	rich	enough	,	and	if	they	have	their	 ideal 	 s 	 	--	in	a	sort	of	domestic	sense	,	they	get	to	 acquir 	 e 	 	their	perfect	world	.
Dean	Koontz	built	this	fabulous	home	theater	,	which	is	--	I	do	n't	think	 accidental 	 ly 	 	--	in	Art	Deco	style	.
That	 symbol 	 izes 	 	this	sense	of	being	safe	and	at	home	.
This	is	not	always	good	,	because	what	is	your	perfect	world	?
What	is	your	ideal	,	and	also	,	what	has	been	edited	out	?
Is	it	something	important	?
``	The	Matrix	''	is	a	movie	that	is	all	about	glamour	.
I	could	do	a	whole	talk	on	``	The	Matrix	''	and	glamour	.
It	was	 criticiz 	 ed 	 	for	 glamor 	 izing 	 	violence	,	because	,	look	--	sunglasses	and	those	long	coats	,	and	,	of	course	,	they	could	walk	up	walls	and	do	all	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	things	that	are	impossible	in	the	real	world	.
This	is	another	Margaret	 Bourke 	 - 	 White 	 	photo	.
This	is	from	Soviet	Union	.	 At 	 tractive 	 	.
I	mean	,	look	how	happy	the	people	are	,	and	 good 	 - 	 looking 	 	too	.
You	know	,	we	're	 march 	 ing 	 	toward	Utopia	.
I	'm	not	a	fan	of	PETA	,	but	I	think	this	is	a	great	ad	.
Because	what	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	is	they	're	saying	,	your	coat	's	not	so	glamorous	,	what	's	been	edited	out	is	something	important	.
But	actually	,	what	's	even	more	important	than	 remember 	 ing 	 	what	's	been	edited	out	is	thinking	,	are	the	 ideal 	 s 	 	good	?
Because	glamour	can	be	very	 totalitaria 	 n 	 	and	 de 	 ceptive 	 	.
And	it	's	not	just	a	matter	of	 glamor 	 izing 	 	cleaning	your	floor	.
This	is	from	``	Triumph	Of	The	Will	''	--	brilliant	editing	to	cut	together	things	.
There	's	a	glamour	shot	.
National	Socialism	is	all	about	glamour	.
It	was	a	very	aesthetic	ideology	.
It	was	all	about	cleaning	up	Germany	,	and	the	West	,	and	the	world	,	and	 ridd 	 ing 	 	it	of	anything	 un 	 glamorous 	 	.
So	glamour	can	be	dangerous	.
I	think	glamour	has	a	genuine	appeal	,	has	a	genuine	value	.
I	'm	not	against	glamour	.
But	there	's	a	kind	of	wonder	in	the	stuff	that	 get 	 s 	 	edited	away	in	the	cords	of	life	.
And	there	is	both	a	way	to	avoid	the	 danger 	 s 	 	of	glamour	and	a	way	to	 broad 	 en 	 	your	appreciation	of	it	.
And	that	's	to	take	Isaac	Mizrahi	's	advice	and	confront	the	manipulation	of	it	all	,	and	sort	of	admit	that	manipulation	is	something	that	we	enjoy	,	but	also	enjoy	how	it	 happen 	 s 	 	.
And	here	's	Hedy	 Lamar 	 r 	 	.
She	's	very	glamorous	but	,	you	know	,	she	 invent 	 ed 	 	 spread 	 - 	 spectrum 	 	technology	.
So	she	's	even	more	glamorous	if	you	know	that	she	 re 	 ally 	 	was	n't	stupid	,	even	though	she	thought	she	could	look	stupid	.
David	 Hock 	 ney 	 	talks	about	how	the	appreciation	of	this	very	glamorous	painting	is	 heighten 	 ed 	 	if	you	think	about	the	fact	that	it	takes	two	weeks	to	paint	this	splash	,	which	only	took	a	fraction	of	a	second	to	happen	.
There	is	a	book	out	in	the	bookstore	--	it	's	called	``	Symphony	In	Steel	,	''	and	it	's	about	the	stuff	that	's	hidden	under	the	skin	of	the	Disney	Center	.
And	that	has	a	 fascin 	 ation 	 	.
It	's	not	 necessar 	 ily 	 	glamorous	,	but	 unveil 	 ing 	 	the	glamour	has	an	appeal	.
There	's	a	wonderful	book	called	``	 Crown 	 s 	 	''	that	's	all	these	glamour	pictures	of	black	women	in	their	church	 hat 	 s 	 	.
And	there	's	a	quote	from	one	of	these	women	,	and	she	talks	about	,	``	As	a	little	girl	,	I	'd	 admir 	 e 	 	women	at	church	with	beautiful	 hat 	 s 	 	.
They	looked	like	beautiful	dolls	,	like	they	'd	just	stepped	out	of	a	magazine	.
But	I	also	knew	how	hard	they	worked	all	week	.
Sometimes	under	those	 hat 	 s 	 	there	's	a	lot	of	joy	and	a	lot	of	sorrow	.	''
And	,	actually	,	you	get	more	appreciation	for	glamour	when	you	 realiz 	 e 	 	what	went	into	creating	it	.
Thank	you	.

Howard	Rheingold	:	The	new	power	of	collaboration
I	'm	here	to	 en 	 list 	 	you	in	 help 	 ing 	 	 re 	 shape 	 	the	story	about	how	humans	and	other	 crit 	 ters 	 	get	things	done	.
Here	is	the	old	story	--	we	've	already	heard	a	little	bit	about	it	:	biology	is	war	in	which	only	the	 fierce 	 st 	 	survive	;	businesses	and	nations	succeed	only	by	 defeat 	 ing 	 	,	 destroy 	 ing 	 	and	 dominat 	 ing 	 	competition	;	politics	is	about	your	side	winning	at	all	costs	.
But	I	think	we	can	see	the	very	 beginning 	 s 	 	of	a	new	story	beginning	to	emerge	.
It	's	a	narrative	spread	across	a	number	of	different	disciplines	,	in	which	cooperation	,	collective	action	and	complex	 inter 	 dependencies 	 	play	a	more	important	role	.
And	the	central	,	but	not	 all 	 - 	 important 	 	,	role	of	competition	and	survival	of	the	 fit 	 test 	 	 shrink 	 s 	 	just	a	little	bit	to	make	room	.
I	started	thinking	about	the	relationship	between	communication	,	media	and	collective	action	when	I	wrote	``	Smart	 Mob 	 s 	 	,	''	and	I	found	that	when	I	finished	the	book	,	I	kept	thinking	about	it	.
In	fact	,	if	you	look	back	,	human	communication	media	and	the	ways	in	which	we	organize	 social 	 ly 	 	have	been	 co 	 - 	 evolving 	 	for	quite	a	long	time	.
Humans	have	lived	for	much	,	much	 long 	 er 	 	than	the	approximately	10,000	years	of	settled	agricultural	civilization	in	small	family	groups	.	Nomadic	hunters	bring	down	 rabbit 	 s 	 	,	gathering	food	.
The	form	of	wealth	in	those	days	was	enough	food	to	stay	alive	.
But	at	some	point	,	they	banded	together	to	hunt	 bigg 	 er 	 	game	.
And	we	do	n't	know	 exact 	 ly 	 	how	they	did	this	,	although	they	must	have	solved	some	collective	action	problems	;	it	only	makes	sense	that	you	ca	n't	hunt	 mastodon 	 s 	 	while	you	're	fighting	with	the	other	groups	.
And	again	,	we	have	no	way	of	knowing	,	but	it	's	clear	that	a	new	form	of	wealth	must	have	 e 	 merged 	 	.
More	protein	than	a	hunter	's	family	could	eat	before	it	 rott 	 ed 	 	.
So	that	raised	a	social	question	that	I	believe	must	have	driven	new	social	forms	.
Did	the	people	who	ate	that	mastodon	meat	owe	something	to	the	hunters	and	their	families	?
And	if	so	,	how	did	they	make	arrangements	?
Again	,	we	ca	n't	know	,	but	we	can	be	pretty	sure	that	some	form	of	symbolic	communication	must	have	been	involved	.
Of	course	,	with	agriculture	came	the	first	big	 civilization 	 s 	 	,	the	first	cities	built	of	mud	and	brick	,	the	first	 empire 	 s 	 	.
And	it	was	the	 administer 	 s 	 	of	these	 empire 	 s 	 	who	began	hiring	people	to	keep	track	of	the	wheat	and	sheep	and	wine	that	was	 ow 	 ed 	 	and	the	taxes	that	was	 ow 	 ed 	 	on	them	by	making	marks	;	marks	on	clay	in	that	time	.
Not	too	much	 long 	 er 	 	after	that	,	the	alphabet	was	 invent 	 ed 	 	.
And	this	powerful	tool	was	 re 	 ally 	 	reserved	,	for	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	years	,	for	the	elite	 administrator 	 s 	 	who	kept	track	of	accounts	for	the	 empire 	 s 	 	.
And	then	another	communication	technology	enabled	new	media	:	the	printing	press	came	along	,	and	within	decades	,	 million 	 s 	 	of	people	became	literate	.
And	from	literate	 population 	 s 	 	,	new	forms	of	collective	action	 e 	 merged 	 	in	the	spheres	of	knowledge	,	religion	and	politics	.
We	saw	scientific	 revolution 	 s 	 	,	the	Protestant	Reformation	,	constitutional	 democrac 	 ies 	 	possible	where	they	had	not	been	possible	before	.
Not	created	by	the	printing	press	,	but	enabled	by	the	collective	action	that	 emerge 	 s 	 	from	literacy	.
And	again	,	new	forms	of	wealth	 e 	 merged 	 	.
Now	,	commerce	is	ancient	.	Markets	are	as	old	as	the	 crossroad 	 s 	 	.
But	capitalism	,	as	we	know	it	,	is	only	a	few	hundred	years	old	,	enabled	by	cooperative	arrangements	and	technologies	,	such	as	the	 joint 	 - 	 stock 	 	ownership	company	,	shared	liability	insurance	,	 double 	 - 	 entry 	 	 book 	 keeping 	 	.
Now	of	course	,	the	 enabl 	 ing 	 	technologies	are	based	on	the	Internet	,	and	in	the	 many 	 - 	 to 	 - 	 many 	 	era	,	every	desktop	is	now	a	printing	press	,	a	broadcasting	station	,	a	community	or	a	 market 	 place 	 	.
Evolution	is	 speed 	 ing 	 	up	.
More	 recent 	 ly 	 	,	that	power	is	 un 	 tether 	 ing 	 	and	 leap 	 ing 	 	off	the	 desktop 	 s 	 	,	and	very	,	very	quickly	,	we	're	going	to	see	a	significant	proportion	,	if	not	the	majority	of	the	human	race	,	walking	around	holding	,	carrying	or	wearing	 super 	 computers 	 	linked	at	speeds	greater	than	what	we	consider	to	be	broadband	today	.
Now	,	when	I	started	looking	into	collective	action	,	the	 considerabl 	 e 	 	literature	on	it	is	based	on	what	 sociologist 	 s 	 	call	``	social	 dilemma 	 s 	 	.	''
And	there	are	a	couple	of	mythic	narratives	of	social	 dilemma 	 s 	 	.
I	'm	going	to	talk	 brief 	 ly 	 	about	two	of	them	:	the	 prison 	 er 	 	's	dilemma	and	the	tragedy	of	the	commons	.
Now	,	when	I	talked	about	this	with	Kevin	Kelly	,	he	assured	me	that	everybody	in	this	audience	pretty	much	knows	the	details	of	the	 prison 	 er 	 	's	dilemma	,	so	I	'm	just	going	to	go	over	that	very	,	very	quickly	.
If	you	have	more	questions	about	it	,	ask	Kevin	Kelly	later	.
The	 prison 	 er 	 	's	dilemma	is	actually	a	story	that	's	 over 	 laid 	 	on	a	mathematical	matrix	that	came	out	of	the	game	theory	in	the	early	years	of	thinking	about	nuclear	war	:	two	players	who	could	n't	trust	each	other	.
Let	me	just	say	that	every	 un 	 secured 	 	transaction	is	a	good	example	of	a	 prison 	 er 	 	's	dilemma	.
Person	with	the	goods	,	person	with	the	money	,	because	they	ca	n't	trust	each	other	,	are	not	going	to	exchange	.
Neither	one	 want 	 s 	 	to	be	the	first	one	or	they	're	going	to	get	the	sucker	's	 pay 	 off 	 	,	but	both	lose	,	of	course	,	because	they	do	n't	get	what	they	want	.
If	they	could	only	agree	,	if	they	could	only	turn	a	 prison 	 er 	 	's	dilemma	into	a	different	 pay 	 off 	 	matrix	called	an	assurance	game	,	they	could	proceed	.
Twenty	years	ago	,	Robert	Axelrod	used	the	 prison 	 er 	 	's	dilemma	as	a	probe	of	the	biological	question	:	if	we	are	here	because	our	 ancestor 	 s 	 	were	such	fierce	 competitor 	 s 	 	,	how	does	cooperation	exist	at	all	?
He	started	a	computer	tournament	for	people	to	submit	 prison 	 er 	 	's	dilemma	strategies	and	discovered	,	much	to	his	surprise	,	that	a	very	,	very	simple	strategy	won	--	it	won	the	first	tournament	,	and	even	after	everyone	knew	it	won	,	it	won	the	second	tournament	--	that	's	known	as	tit	for	tat	.
Another	economic	game	that	may	not	be	as	well	known	as	the	 prison 	 er 	 	's	dilemma	is	the	 ultimat 	 um 	 	game	,	and	it	's	also	a	very	 interest 	 ing 	 	probe	of	our	 assumption 	 s 	 	about	the	way	people	make	economic	 transaction 	 s 	 	.
Here	's	how	the	game	is	played	:	there	are	two	players	;	they	've	never	played	the	game	before	,	they	will	not	play	the	game	again	,	they	do	n't	know	each	other	,	and	they	are	,	in	fact	,	in	separate	rooms	.
First	player	is	offered	a	hundred	dollars	and	is	asked	to	propose	a	split	:	50/50	,	90/10	,	whatever	that	player	 want 	 s 	 	to	propose	.	The	second	player	either	 accept 	 s 	 	the	split	--	both	players	are	paid	and	the	game	is	over	--	or	 reject 	 s 	 	the	split	--	neither	player	is	paid	and	the	game	is	over	.
Now	,	the	fundamental	basis	of	 neoclassic 	 al 	 	economics	would	tell	you	it	's	irrational	to	reject	a	dollar	because	someone	you	do	n't	know	in	another	room	is	going	to	get	99	.
Yet	in	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	trials	with	American	and	European	and	Japanese	students	,	a	significant	percentage	would	reject	any	offer	that	's	not	close	to	50/50	.
And	although	they	were	 screen 	 ed 	 	and	did	n't	know	about	the	game	and	had	never	played	the	game	before	,	 propos 	 ers 	 	 see 	 med 	 	to	 inn 	 ately 	 	know	this	because	the	average	proposal	was	 s 	 urprisingly 	 	close	to	50/50	.
Now	,	the	 interest 	 ing 	 	part	comes	in	more	 recent 	 ly 	 	when	 anthropologist 	 s 	 	began	taking	this	game	to	other	cultures	and	discovered	,	to	their	surprise	,	that	 slash 	 - 	 and 	 - 	 burn 	 	 agricultural 	 ists 	 	in	the	Amazon	or	nomadic	 pastoral 	 ists 	 	in	Central	Asia	or	a	dozen	different	cultures	--	each	had	 radical 	 ly 	 	different	ideas	of	what	is	fair	.
Which	 suggest 	 s 	 	that	instead	of	there	being	an	 in 	 nate 	 	sense	of	 fair 	 ness 	 	,	that	 some 	 how 	 	the	basis	of	our	economic	 transaction 	 s 	 	can	be	 influence 	 d 	 	by	our	social	institutions	,	whether	we	know	that	or	not	.
The	other	major	narrative	of	social	 dilemma 	 s 	 	is	the	tragedy	of	the	commons	.
Garrett	Hardin	used	it	to	talk	about	 over 	 population 	 	in	the	late	1960s	.
He	used	the	example	of	a	common	grazing	area	in	which	each	person	by	simply	 maximiz 	 ing 	 	their	own	flock	led	to	 over 	 grazing 	 	and	the	depletion	of	the	resource	.
He	had	the	rather	 gloom 	 y 	 	conclusion	that	humans	will	 inevit 	 ably 	 	despoil	any	common	pool	resource	in	which	people	can	not	be	 restrain 	 ed 	 	from	 us 	 ing 	 	it	.
Now	,	Elinor	Ostrom	,	a	political	scientist	,	in	1990	asked	the	 interest 	 ing 	 	question	that	any	good	scientist	should	ask	,	which	is	:	is	it	 re 	 ally 	 	true	that	humans	will	always	despoil	commons	?
So	she	went	out	and	looked	at	what	data	she	could	find	.
She	looked	at	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	cases	of	humans	sharing	 watershed 	 s 	 	,	forestry	resources	,	fisheries	,	and	discovered	that	yes	,	in	case	after	case	,	humans	destroyed	the	commons	that	they	 depend 	 ed 	 	on	.
But	she	also	found	many	 instance 	 s 	 	in	which	people	 escape 	 d 	 	the	 prison 	 er 	 	's	dilemma	;	in	fact	,	the	tragedy	of	the	commons	is	a	 multi 	 player 	 	 prison 	 er 	 	's	dilemma	.
And	she	said	that	people	are	only	prisoners	if	they	consider	themselves	to	be	.
They	escape	by	creating	institutions	for	collective	action	.
And	she	discovered	,	I	think	most	 interest 	 ingly 	 	,	that	among	those	institutions	that	worked	,	there	were	a	number	of	common	design	principles	,	and	those	principles	seem	to	be	missing	from	those	institutions	that	do	n't	work	.
I	'm	moving	very	quickly	over	a	number	of	disciplines	.	In	biology	,	the	 notion 	 s 	 	of	symbiosis	,	group	selection	,	evolutionary	psychology	are	contested	,	to	be	sure	.
But	there	is	 re 	 ally 	 	no	 long 	 er 	 	any	major	debate	over	the	fact	that	cooperative	arrangements	have	moved	from	a	peripheral	role	to	a	central	role	in	biology	,	from	the	level	of	the	cell	to	the	level	of	the	ecology	.
And	again	,	our	 notion 	 s 	 	of	 individual 	 s 	 	as	economic	beings	have	been	 overturn 	 ed 	 	.
Rational	 self 	 - 	 interest 	 	is	not	always	the	 dominat 	 ing 	 	factor	.
In	fact	,	people	will	act	to	punish	 cheater 	 s 	 	,	even	at	a	cost	to	themselves	.
And	most	 recent 	 ly 	 	,	 neuro 	 physiological 	 	measures	have	shown	that	people	who	punish	 cheater 	 s 	 	in	economic	games	show	activity	in	the	reward	centers	of	their	brain	.
Which	led	one	scientist	to	declare	that	 altruist 	 ic 	 	punishment	may	be	the	glue	that	holds	societies	together	.
Now	,	I	've	been	talking	about	how	new	forms	of	communication	and	new	media	in	the	past	have	 help 	 ed 	 	create	new	economic	forms	.
Commerce	is	ancient	.	Markets	are	very	old	.	Capitalism	is	 fair 	 ly 	 	recent	;	socialism	 e 	 merged 	 	as	a	reaction	to	that	.
And	yet	we	see	very	little	talk	about	how	the	next	form	may	be	emerging	.
Jim	 Suro 	 wiecki 	 	 brief 	 ly 	 	mentioned	 Yocha 	 i 	 	 Benk 	 ler 	 	's	paper	about	open	source	,	pointing	to	a	new	form	of	production	:	 peer 	 - 	 to 	 - 	 peer 	 	production	.
I	simply	want	you	to	keep	in	mind	that	if	in	the	past	,	new	forms	of	cooperation	enabled	by	new	technologies	create	new	forms	of	wealth	,	we	may	be	moving	into	yet	another	economic	form	that	is	 s 	 ignificantly 	 	different	from	previous	ones	.
Very	 brief 	 ly 	 	,	let	's	look	at	some	businesses	.	IBM	,	as	you	know	,	HP	,	Sun	--	some	of	the	most	fierce	 competitor 	 s 	 	in	the	IT	world	are	open	sourcing	their	software	,	are	providing	 portfolio 	 s 	 	of	 patent 	 s 	 	for	the	commons	.
Eli	Lilly	--	in	,	again	,	the	 fierce 	 ly 	 	competitive	pharmaceutical	world	--	has	created	a	market	for	solutions	for	pharmaceutical	problems	.
Toyota	,	instead	of	treating	its	 supplier 	 s 	 	as	a	 market 	 place 	 	,	 treat 	 s 	 	them	as	a	network	and	trains	them	to	produce	better	,	even	though	they	are	also	training	them	to	produce	better	for	their	 competitor 	 s 	 	.
Now	none	of	these	companies	are	 do 	 ing 	 	this	out	of	 altru 	 ism 	 	;	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	it	because	they	're	learning	that	a	certain	kind	of	sharing	is	in	their	 self 	 - 	 interest 	 	.
Open	source	production	has	shown	us	that	 world 	 - 	 class 	 	software	,	like	Linux	and	Mozilla	,	can	be	created	with	neither	the	bureaucratic	structure	of	the	firm	nor	the	incentives	of	the	 market 	 place 	 	as	we	've	known	them	.
Google	 enrich 	 es 	 	itself	by	 enrich 	 ing 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	bloggers	through	 Ad 	 Sense 	 	.
Amazon	has	opened	its	Application	Programming	Interface	to	60,000	 developer 	 s 	 	,	 count 	 less 	 	Amazon	shops	.
They	're	 enrich 	 ing 	 	others	,	not	out	of	 altru 	 ism 	 	but	as	a	way	of	 enrich 	 ing 	 	themselves	.
 e 	 Bay 	 	solved	the	 prison 	 er 	 	's	dilemma	and	created	a	market	where	none	would	have	existed	by	creating	a	feedback	mechanism	that	turns	a	 prison 	 er 	 	's	dilemma	game	into	an	assurance	game	.
Instead	of	,	``	Neither	of	us	can	trust	each	other	,	so	we	have	to	make	 sub 	 optimal 	 	moves	,	''	it	's	,	``	You	prove	to	me	that	you	are	 trustworth 	 y 	 	and	I	will	 cooperat 	 e 	 	.	''
Wikipedia	has	used	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	volunteers	to	create	a	free	encyclopedia	with	a	million	and	a	half	articles	in	200	languages	in	just	a	couple	of	years	.
We	've	seen	that	 Think 	 Cycle 	 	has	enabled	NGOs	in	developing	countries	to	put	up	problems	to	be	solved	by	design	students	around	the	world	,	including	something	that	's	being	used	for	tsunami	relief	right	now	:	it	's	a	mechanism	for	 re 	 hydrating 	 	 chole 	 ra 	 	victims	that	's	so	simple	to	use	it	,	 illite 	 rates 	 	can	be	trained	to	use	it	.
BitTorrent	turns	every	 download 	 er 	 	into	an	 upload 	 er 	 	,	making	the	system	more	efficient	the	more	it	is	used	.
 Million 	 s 	 	of	people	have	 contribut 	 ed 	 	their	desktop	computers	when	they	're	not	 us 	 ing 	 	them	to	link	together	through	the	Internet	into	 super 	 computing 	 	 collective 	 s 	 	that	help	solve	the	protein	folding	problem	for	medical	 research 	 ers 	 	--	that	's	Folding	@	home	at	Stanford	--	to	crack	codes	,	to	search	for	life	in	outer	space	.
I	do	n't	think	we	know	enough	yet	.
I	do	n't	think	we	've	even	begun	to	discover	what	the	basic	principles	are	,	but	I	think	we	can	begin	to	think	about	them	.
And	I	do	n't	have	enough	time	to	talk	about	all	of	them	,	but	think	about	 self 	 - 	 interest 	 	.
This	is	all	about	 self 	 - 	 interest 	 	that	 add 	 s 	 	up	to	more	.
In	El	Salvador	,	both	sides	that	withdrew	from	their	civil	war	took	moves	that	had	been	proven	to	mirror	a	 prison 	 er 	 	's	dilemma	strategy	.
In	the	U.S.	,	in	the	Philippines	,	in	Kenya	,	around	the	world	,	citizens	have	 self 	 - 	 organized 	 	political	protests	and	get	out	the	vote	campaigns	 us 	 ing 	 	mobile	devices	and	SMS	.
Is	an	Apollo	Project	of	cooperation	possible	?
A	 trans 	 disciplinary 	 	study	of	cooperation	?
I	believe	that	the	 pay 	 off 	 	would	be	very	big	.
I	think	we	need	to	begin	developing	maps	of	this	territory	so	that	we	can	talk	about	it	across	disciplines	.
And	I	am	not	saying	that	understanding	cooperation	is	going	to	cause	us	to	be	better	people	--	and	sometimes	people	 cooperat 	 e 	 	to	do	bad	things	--	but	I	will	 re 	 mind 	 	you	that	a	few	hundred	years	ago	,	people	saw	their	loved	ones	die	from	diseases	they	thought	were	caused	by	sin	or	 foreign 	 ers 	 	or	evil	 spirit 	 s 	 	.
 Descart 	 es 	 	said	we	need	an	entire	new	way	of	thinking	.
When	the	scientific	method	provided	that	new	way	of	thinking	and	biology	 show 	 ed 	 	that	 micro 	 organisms 	 	caused	disease	,	 s 	 uffering 	 	was	 alleviate 	 d 	 	.
What	forms	of	 s 	 uffering 	 	could	be	 alleviate 	 d 	 	,	what	forms	of	wealth	could	be	created	if	we	knew	a	little	bit	more	about	cooperation	?
I	do	n't	think	that	this	 trans 	 disciplinary 	 	discourse	is	 automatic 	 ally 	 	going	to	happen	;	it	's	going	to	require	effort	.
So	I	 en 	 list 	 	you	to	help	me	get	the	cooperation	project	started	.
Thank	you	.

Rebecca	Saxe	:	How	we	read	each	other	's	minds
Today	I	'm	going	to	talk	to	you	about	the	problem	of	other	minds	.
And	the	problem	I	'm	going	to	talk	about	is	not	the	familiar	one	from	philosophy	,	which	is	,	``	How	can	we	know	whether	other	people	have	minds	?	''
That	is	,	maybe	you	have	a	mind	,	and	everyone	else	is	just	a	 re 	 ally 	 	convincing	robot	.
So	that	's	a	problem	in	philosophy	,	but	for	today	's	purposes	I	'm	going	to	assume	that	many	people	in	this	audience	have	a	mind	,	and	that	I	do	n't	have	to	worry	about	this	.
There	is	a	second	problem	that	is	maybe	even	more	familiar	to	us	as	parents	and	teachers	and	 spouse 	 s 	 	and	 novelist 	 s 	 	,	which	is	,	``	Why	is	it	so	hard	to	know	what	 some 	 body 	 	else	 want 	 s 	 	or	 believe 	 s 	 	?	''
Or	 perhap 	 s 	 	,	more	 relevant 	 ly 	 	,	``	Why	is	it	so	hard	to	change	what	 some 	 body 	 	else	 want 	 s 	 	or	 believe 	 s 	 	?	''
I	think	 novelist 	 s 	 	put	this	best	.
Like	Philip	Roth	,	who	said	,	``	And	yet	,	what	are	we	to	do	about	this	 terri 	 bly 	 	significant	business	of	other	people	?
So	ill	equipped	are	we	all	,	to	 en 	 vision 	 	one	another	's	interior	 working 	 s 	 	and	invisible	aims	.	''
So	as	a	teacher	and	as	a	spouse	,	this	is	,	of	course	,	a	problem	I	confront	every	day	.
But	as	a	scientist	,	I	'm	interested	in	a	different	problem	of	other	minds	,	and	that	is	the	one	I	'm	going	to	 introduc 	 e 	 	to	you	today	.
And	that	problem	is	,	``	How	is	it	so	easy	to	know	other	minds	?	''
So	to	start	with	an	illustration	,	you	need	almost	no	information	,	one	snapshot	of	a	stranger	,	to	guess	what	this	woman	is	thinking	,	or	what	this	man	is	.
And	put	another	way	,	the	crux	of	the	problem	is	the	machine	that	we	use	for	thinking	about	other	minds	,	our	brain	,	is	made	up	of	pieces	,	brain	cells	,	that	we	share	with	all	other	animals	,	with	monkeys	and	mice	and	even	sea	slugs	.
And	yet	,	you	put	them	together	in	a	particular	network	,	and	what	you	get	is	the	capacity	to	write	Romeo	and	Juliet	.
Or	to	say	,	as	Alan	 Green 	 span 	 	did	,	``	I	know	you	think	you	understand	what	you	thought	I	said	,	but	I	'm	not	sure	you	 realiz 	 e 	 	that	what	you	heard	is	not	what	I	meant	.	''
So	,	the	job	of	my	field	of	cognitive	 neuro 	 science 	 	is	to	stand	with	these	ideas	,	one	in	each	hand	.
And	to	try	to	understand	how	you	can	put	together	simple	units	,	simple	messages	over	space	and	time	,	in	a	network	,	and	get	this	amazing	human	capacity	to	think	about	minds	.
So	I	'm	going	to	tell	you	three	things	about	this	today	.
 Obvious 	 ly 	 	the	whole	project	here	is	huge	.
And	I	'm	going	to	tell	you	just	our	first	few	steps	about	the	discovery	of	a	special	brain	region	for	thinking	about	other	people	's	 thought 	 s 	 	.
Some	 observation 	 s 	 	on	the	slow	development	of	this	system	as	we	learn	how	to	do	this	difficult	job	.
And	then	finally	,	to	show	that	some	of	the	differences	between	people	,	in	how	we	judge	others	,	can	be	explained	by	differences	in	this	brain	system	.
So	first	,	the	first	thing	I	want	to	tell	you	is	that	there	is	a	brain	region	in	the	human	brain	,	in	your	brains	,	whose	job	it	is	to	think	about	other	people	's	 thought 	 s 	 	.
This	is	a	picture	of	it	.
It	's	called	the	Right	 Temporo 	 - 	 Pariet 	 al 	 	Junction	.
It	's	above	and	behind	your	right	ear	.
And	this	is	the	brain	region	you	used	when	you	saw	the	pictures	I	 show 	 ed 	 	you	,	or	when	you	read	Romeo	and	Juliet	or	when	you	tried	to	understand	Alan	 Green 	 span 	 	.
And	you	do	n't	use	it	for	solving	any	other	 kind 	 s 	 	of	logical	problems	.
So	this	brain	region	is	called	the	Right	 T 	 PJ 	 	.
And	this	picture	shows	the	average	activation	in	a	group	of	what	we	call	typical	human	adults	.
They	're	MIT	 under 	 graduates 	 	.
The	second	thing	I	want	to	say	about	this	brain	system	is	that	although	we	human	adults	are	 re 	 ally 	 	good	at	understanding	other	minds	,	we	were	n't	always	that	way	.
It	takes	children	a	long	time	to	break	into	the	system	.
I	'm	going	to	show	you	a	little	bit	of	that	long	,	extended	process	.
The	first	thing	I	'm	going	to	show	you	is	a	change	between	age	three	and	five	,	as	kids	learn	to	understand	that	 some 	 body 	 	else	can	have	beliefs	that	are	different	from	their	own	.
So	I	'm	going	to	show	you	a	 five 	 - 	 year 	 - 	 old 	 	who	is	getting	a	standard	kind	of	puzzle	that	we	call	the	false	belief	task	.
Rebecca	Saxe	:	This	is	the	first	pirate	.	His	name	is	Ivan	.
And	you	know	what	pirates	 re 	 ally 	 	like	?
Child	:	What	?	RS	:	Pirates	 re 	 ally 	 	like	cheese	 sandwich 	 es 	 	.
Child	:	Cheese	?	I	love	cheese	!
RS	:	Yeah	.	So	Ivan	has	this	cheese	sandwich	,	and	he	says	,	``	Yum	yum	yum	yum	yum	!
I	 re 	 ally 	 	love	cheese	 sandwich 	 es 	 	.	''
And	Ivan	puts	his	sandwich	over	here	,	on	top	of	the	pirate	chest	.
And	Ivan	says	,	``	You	know	what	?	I	need	a	drink	with	my	lunch	.	''
And	so	Ivan	goes	to	get	a	drink	.
And	while	Ivan	is	away	the	wind	comes	,	and	it	blows	the	sandwich	down	onto	the	grass	.
And	now	,	here	comes	the	other	pirate	.
This	pirate	is	called	Joshua	.
And	Joshua	also	 re 	 ally 	 	loves	cheese	 sandwich 	 es 	 	.
So	Joshua	has	a	cheese	sandwich	and	he	says	,	``	Yum	yum	yum	yum	yum	!	I	love	cheese	 sandwich 	 es 	 	.	''
And	he	puts	his	cheese	sandwich	over	here	on	top	of	the	pirate	chest	.
Child	:	So	,	that	one	is	his	.
RS	:	That	one	is	Joshua	's	.	That	's	right	.
Child	:	And	then	his	went	on	the	ground	.
RS	:	That	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	right	.
Child	:	So	he	wo	n't	know	which	one	is	his	.
RS	:	Oh	.	So	now	Joshua	goes	off	to	get	a	drink	.
Ivan	comes	back	and	he	says	,	``	I	want	my	cheese	sandwich	.	''
So	which	one	do	you	think	Ivan	is	going	to	take	?
Child	:	I	think	he	is	going	to	take	that	one	.
RS	:	Yeah	,	you	think	he	's	going	to	take	that	one	?	All	right	.	Let	's	see	.
Oh	yeah	,	you	were	right	.	He	took	that	one	.
So	that	's	a	 five 	 - 	 year 	 - 	 old 	 	who	 clear 	 ly 	 	 understand 	 s 	 	that	other	people	can	have	false	beliefs	and	what	the	 consequence 	 s 	 	are	for	their	actions	.
Now	I	'm	going	to	show	you	a	 three 	 - 	 year 	 - 	 old 	 	who	got	the	same	puzzle	.
RS	:	And	Ivan	says	,	``	I	want	my	cheese	sandwich	.	''
Which	sandwich	is	he	going	to	take	?
Do	you	think	he	's	going	to	take	that	one	?	Let	's	see	what	 happen 	 s 	 	.
Let	's	see	what	he	does	.	Here	comes	Ivan	.
And	he	says	,	``	I	want	my	cheese	sandwich	.	''
And	he	takes	this	one	.
 Uh 	 - 	 oh 	 	.	Why	did	he	take	that	one	?
Child	:	His	was	on	the	grass	.
So	the	 three 	 - 	 year 	 - 	 old 	 	does	two	things	 different 	 ly 	 	.
First	,	he	 predict 	 s 	 	Ivan	will	take	the	sandwich	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	his	.
And	second	,	when	he	 see 	 s 	 	Ivan	taking	the	sandwich	where	he	left	his	,	where	we	would	say	he	's	taking	that	one	because	he	 think 	 s 	 	it	's	his	,	the	 three 	 - 	 year 	 - 	 old 	 	comes	up	with	another	explanation	:	He	's	not	taking	his	own	sandwich	because	he	does	n't	want	it	,	because	now	it	's	dirty	,	on	the	ground	.
So	that	's	why	he	's	taking	the	other	sandwich	.
Now	of	course	,	development	does	n't	end	at	five	.
And	we	can	see	the	continuation	of	this	process	of	learning	to	think	about	other	people	's	 thought 	 s 	 	by	upping	the	ante	and	 as 	 king 	 	children	now	,	not	for	an	action	prediction	,	but	for	a	moral	judgment	.
So	first	I	'm	going	to	show	you	the	 three 	 - 	 year 	 - 	 old 	 	again	.
RS	.	:	So	is	Ivan	being	mean	and	naughty	for	taking	Joshua	's	sandwich	?
Child	:	Yeah	.
RS	:	Should	Ivan	get	in	trouble	for	taking	Joshua	's	sandwich	?
Child	:	Yeah	.
So	it	's	maybe	not	 surpris 	 ing 	 	he	 think 	 s 	 	it	was	mean	of	Ivan	to	take	Joshua	's	sandwich	,	since	he	 think 	 s 	 	Ivan	only	took	Joshua	's	sandwich	to	avoid	having	to	eat	his	own	dirty	sandwich	.
But	now	I	'm	going	to	show	you	the	 five 	 - 	 year 	 - 	 old 	 	.
Remember	the	 five 	 - 	 year 	 - 	 old 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	understood	why	Ivan	took	Joshua	's	sandwich	.
RS	:	Was	Ivan	being	mean	and	naughty	for	taking	Joshua	's	sandwich	?
Child	:	Um	,	yeah	.
And	so	,	it	is	not	until	age	seven	that	we	get	what	looks	more	like	an	adult	response	.
RS	:	Should	Ivan	get	in	trouble	for	taking	Joshua	's	sandwich	?
Child	:	No	,	because	the	wind	should	get	in	trouble	.
He	says	the	wind	should	get	in	trouble	for	switching	the	 sandwich 	 es 	 	.
And	now	what	we	've	started	to	do	in	my	lab	is	to	put	children	into	the	brain	scanner	and	ask	what	's	going	on	in	their	brain	as	they	develop	this	ability	to	think	about	other	people	's	 thought 	 s 	 	.
So	the	first	thing	is	that	in	children	we	see	this	same	brain	region	,	the	Right	 T 	 PJ 	 	,	being	used	while	children	are	thinking	about	other	people	.
But	it	's	not	quite	like	the	adult	brain	.
So	whereas	in	the	adults	,	as	I	told	you	,	this	brain	region	is	almost	 complete 	 ly 	 	specialized	--	it	does	almost	nothing	else	except	for	thinking	about	other	people	's	 thought 	 s 	 	--	in	children	it	's	much	less	so	,	when	they	are	age	five	to	eight	,	the	age	range	of	the	children	I	just	 show 	 ed 	 	you	.
And	actually	if	we	even	look	at	eight	to	11-year-olds	,	getting	into	early	adolescence	,	they	still	do	n't	have	quite	an	 adult 	 - 	 like 	 	brain	region	.
And	so	,	what	we	can	see	is	that	over	the	course	of	childhood	and	even	into	adolescence	,	both	the	cognitive	system	,	our	mind	's	ability	to	think	about	other	minds	,	and	the	brain	system	that	 support 	 s 	 	it	are	 continu 	 ing 	 	,	 slow 	 ly 	 	,	to	develop	.
But	of	course	,	as	you	're	probably	aware	,	even	in	adulthood	,	people	differ	from	one	another	in	how	good	they	are	at	thinking	of	other	minds	,	how	often	they	do	it	and	how	 accurate 	 ly 	 	.
And	so	what	we	wanted	to	know	was	,	could	differences	among	adults	in	how	they	think	about	other	people	's	 thought 	 s 	 	be	explained	in	terms	of	differences	in	this	brain	region	?
So	,	the	first	thing	that	we	did	is	we	gave	adults	a	version	of	the	pirate	problem	that	we	gave	to	the	kids	.
And	I	'm	going	to	give	that	to	you	now	.
So	Grace	and	her	friend	are	on	a	tour	of	a	chemical	factory	,	and	they	take	a	break	for	coffee	.
And	Grace	's	friend	 ask 	 s 	 	for	some	sugar	in	her	coffee	.
Grace	goes	to	make	the	coffee	and	finds	by	the	coffee	a	pot	containing	a	white	powder	,	which	is	sugar	.
But	the	powder	is	labeled	``	Deadly	Poison	,	''	so	Grace	 think 	 s 	 	that	the	powder	is	a	deadly	poison	.
And	she	puts	it	in	her	friend	's	coffee	.
And	her	friend	drinks	the	coffee	,	and	is	fine	.
How	many	people	think	it	was	 mor 	 ally 	 	 per 	 missible 	 	for	Grace	to	put	the	powder	in	the	coffee	?
Okay	.	Good	.
So	we	ask	people	,	how	much	should	Grace	be	 blame 	 d 	 	in	this	case	,	which	we	call	a	failed	attempt	to	harm	?
And	we	can	compare	that	to	another	case	,	where	everything	in	the	real	world	is	the	same	.
The	powder	is	still	sugar	,	but	what	's	different	is	what	Grace	 think 	 s 	 	.
Now	she	 think 	 s 	 	the	powder	is	sugar	.
And	 perhap 	 s 	 	 un 	 s 	 urprisingly 	 	,	if	Grace	 think 	 s 	 	the	powder	is	sugar	and	puts	it	in	her	friend	's	coffee	,	people	say	she	 de 	 serves 	 	no	blame	at	all	.
Whereas	if	she	 think 	 s 	 	the	powder	was	poison	,	even	though	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	sugar	,	now	people	say	she	 de 	 serves 	 	a	lot	of	blame	,	even	though	what	happened	in	the	real	world	was	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	.
And	in	fact	,	they	say	she	 de 	 serves 	 	more	blame	in	this	case	,	the	failed	attempt	to	harm	,	than	in	another	case	,	which	we	call	an	accident	.
Where	Grace	thought	the	powder	was	sugar	,	because	it	was	labeled	``	sugar	''	and	by	the	coffee	machine	,	but	actually	the	powder	was	poison	.
So	even	though	when	the	powder	was	poison	,	the	friend	 d 	 rank 	 	the	coffee	and	died	,	people	say	Grace	 de 	 serves 	 	less	blame	in	that	case	,	when	she	 innocent 	 ly 	 	thought	it	was	sugar	,	than	in	the	other	case	,	where	she	thought	it	was	poison	and	no	harm	occurred	.
People	,	though	,	disagree	a	little	bit	about	 exact 	 ly 	 	how	much	blame	Grace	should	get	in	the	accident	case	.
Some	people	think	she	should	 de 	 serve 	 	more	blame	,	and	other	people	less	.
And	what	I	'm	going	to	show	you	is	what	happened	when	we	look	inside	the	brains	of	people	while	they	're	making	that	judgment	.
So	what	I	'm	showing	you	,	from	left	to	right	,	is	how	much	activity	there	was	in	this	brain	region	,	and	from	top	to	bottom	,	how	much	blame	people	said	that	Grace	deserved	.
And	what	you	can	see	is	,	on	the	left	when	there	was	very	little	activity	in	this	brain	region	,	people	paid	little	attention	to	her	innocent	belief	and	said	she	deserved	a	lot	of	blame	for	the	accident	.
Whereas	on	the	right	,	where	there	was	a	lot	of	activity	,	people	paid	a	lot	more	attention	to	her	innocent	belief	,	and	said	she	deserved	a	lot	less	blame	for	 caus 	 ing 	 	the	accident	.
So	that	's	good	,	but	of	course	what	we	'd	rather	is	have	a	way	to	 interfer 	 e 	 	with	function	in	this	brain	region	,	and	see	if	we	could	change	people	's	moral	judgment	.
And	we	do	have	such	a	tool	.
It	's	called	 Trans 	 - 	 Crani 	 al 	 	Magnetic	 Stimul 	 ation 	 	,	or	TMS	.
This	is	a	tool	that	lets	us	pass	a	magnetic	pulse	through	 some 	 body 	 	's	skull	,	into	a	small	region	of	their	brain	,	and	 tempor 	 arily 	 	 dis 	 organize 	 	the	function	of	the	neurons	in	that	region	.
So	I	'm	going	to	show	you	a	demo	of	this	.
First	,	I	'm	going	to	show	you	that	this	is	a	magnetic	pulse	.
I	'm	going	to	show	you	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	you	put	a	quarter	on	the	machine	.
When	you	hear	 click 	 s 	 	,	we	're	turning	the	machine	on	.
So	now	I	'm	going	to	apply	that	same	pulse	to	my	brain	,	to	the	part	of	my	brain	that	controls	my	hand	.
So	there	is	no	physical	force	,	just	a	magnetic	pulse	.
Woman	:	Ready	,	Rebecca	?	RS	:	Yes	.
Okay	,	so	it	causes	a	small	 in 	 voluntary 	 	contraction	in	my	hand	by	putting	a	magnetic	pulse	in	my	brain	.
And	we	can	use	that	same	pulse	,	now	 a 	 pplied 	 	to	the	 RTP 	 J 	 	,	to	ask	if	we	can	change	people	's	moral	 judgment 	 s 	 	.
So	these	are	the	 judgment 	 s 	 	I	 show 	 ed 	 	you	before	,	people	's	normal	moral	 judgment 	 s 	 	.
And	then	we	can	apply	TMS	to	the	 RTP 	 J 	 	and	ask	how	people	's	 judgment 	 s 	 	change	.
And	the	first	thing	is	,	people	can	still	do	this	task	overall	.
So	their	 judgment 	 s 	 	of	the	case	when	everything	was	fine	remain	the	same	.	They	say	she	 de 	 serves 	 	no	blame	.
But	in	the	case	of	a	failed	attempt	to	harm	,	where	Grace	thought	that	it	was	poison	,	although	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	sugar	,	people	now	say	it	was	more	okay	,	she	 de 	 serves 	 	less	blame	for	putting	the	powder	in	the	coffee	.
And	in	the	case	of	the	accident	,	where	she	thought	that	it	was	sugar	,	but	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	poison	and	so	she	caused	a	death	,	people	say	that	it	was	less	okay	,	she	 de 	 serves 	 	more	blame	.
So	what	I	've	told	you	today	is	that	people	come	,	actually	,	especially	well	equipped	to	think	about	other	people	's	 thought 	 s 	 	.
We	have	a	special	brain	system	that	lets	us	think	about	what	other	people	are	thinking	.
This	system	takes	a	long	time	to	develop	,	 slow 	 ly 	 	throughout	the	course	of	childhood	and	into	early	adolescence	.
And	even	in	adulthood	,	differences	in	this	brain	region	can	explain	differences	among	adults	in	how	we	think	about	and	judge	other	people	.
But	I	want	to	give	the	last	word	back	to	the	 novelist 	 s 	 	,	and	to	Philip	Roth	,	who	ended	by	saying	,	``	The	fact	remains	that	getting	people	right	is	not	what	living	is	all	about	 any 	 way 	 	.
It	's	getting	them	wrong	that	is	living	.
Getting	them	wrong	and	wrong	and	wrong	,	and	then	on	careful	 re 	 consideration 	 	,	getting	them	wrong	again	.	''
Thank	you	.
Chris	Anderson	:	So	,	I	have	a	question	.	When	you	start	talking	about	 us 	 ing 	 	magnetic	 pulse 	 s 	 	to	change	people	's	moral	 judgment 	 s 	 	,	that	sounds	 alarm 	 ing 	 	.
Please	tell	me	that	you	're	not	taking	phone	calls	from	the	Pentagon	,	say	.
RS	:	I	'm	not	.
I	mean	,	they	're	calling	,	but	I	'm	not	taking	the	call	.
CA	:	They	 re 	 ally 	 	are	calling	?
So	then	 serious 	 ly 	 	,	you	must	lie	awake	at	night	sometimes	 wonder 	 ing 	 	where	this	work	leads	.
I	mean	,	you	're	 clear 	 ly 	 	an	 incredibl 	 e 	 	human	being	,	but	someone	could	take	this	knowledge	and	in	some	future	 not 	 - 	 torture 	 	chamber	,	do	acts	that	people	here	might	be	worried	about	.
RS	:	Yeah	,	we	worry	about	this	.
So	,	there	's	a	couple	of	things	to	say	about	TMS	.
One	is	that	you	ca	n't	be	 TMS 	 ed 	 	without	knowing	it	.
So	it	's	not	a	 surrept 	 itious 	 	technology	.
It	's	quite	hard	,	actually	,	to	get	those	very	small	changes	.
The	changes	I	 show 	 ed 	 	you	are	 impressiv 	 e 	 	to	me	because	of	what	they	tell	us	about	the	function	of	the	brain	,	but	they	're	small	on	the	scale	of	the	moral	 judgment 	 s 	 	that	we	actually	make	.
And	what	we	changed	was	not	people	's	moral	 judgment 	 s 	 	when	they	're	 decid 	 ing 	 	what	to	do	,	when	they	're	making	action	choices	.
We	changed	their	ability	to	judge	other	people	's	actions	.
And	so	,	I	think	of	what	I	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	not	so	much	as	 study 	 ing 	 	the	defendant	in	a	criminal	trial	,	but	 study 	 ing 	 	the	jury	.
CA	:	Is	your	work	going	to	lead	to	any	 recommendation 	 s 	 	in	education	,	to	 perhap 	 s 	 	bring	up	a	generation	of	kids	able	to	make	 fair 	 er 	 	moral	 judgment 	 s 	 	?
RS	:	That	's	one	of	the	 idealist 	 ic 	 	 hope 	 s 	 	.
The	whole	research	program	here	of	 study 	 ing 	 	the	 d 	 istinctive 	 	parts	of	the	human	brain	is	brand	new	.
Until	 recent 	 ly 	 	,	what	we	knew	about	the	brain	were	the	things	that	any	other	animal	's	brain	could	do	too	,	so	we	could	study	it	in	animal	models	.
We	knew	how	brains	see	,	and	how	they	control	the	body	and	how	they	hear	and	sense	.
And	the	whole	project	of	understanding	how	brains	do	the	 unique 	 ly 	 	human	things	--	learn	language	and	abstract	concepts	,	and	thinking	about	other	people	's	 thought 	 s 	 	--	that	's	brand	new	.
And	we	do	n't	know	yet	what	the	 implication 	 s 	 	will	be	of	understanding	it	.
CA	:	So	I	've	got	one	last	question	.	There	is	this	thing	called	the	hard	problem	of	consciousness	,	that	 puzzle 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	people	.
The	notion	that	you	can	understand	why	a	brain	works	,	 perhap 	 s 	 	.
But	why	does	 any 	 one 	 	have	to	feel	anything	?
Why	does	it	seem	to	require	these	beings	who	sense	things	for	us	to	operate	?
You	're	a	brilliant	young	 neuro 	 scientist 	 	.
I	mean	,	what	 chance 	 s 	 	do	you	think	there	are	that	at	some	time	in	your	career	,	someone	,	you	or	someone	else	,	is	going	to	come	up	with	some	paradigm	shift	in	understanding	what	 seem 	 s 	 	an	impossible	problem	?
RS	:	I	hope	they	do	.	And	I	think	they	probably	wo	n't	.
CA	:	Why	?
RS	:	It	's	not	called	the	hard	problem	of	consciousness	for	nothing	.
CA	:	That	's	a	great	answer	.	Rebecca	Saxe	,	thank	you	very	much	.	That	was	fantastic	.

Blaise	 A 	 guera 	 	y	 Arca 	 s 	 	demos	 augmented 	 - 	 reality 	 	maps
About	a	year	and	a	half	ago	,	Stephen	Lawler	,	who	also	gave	a	talk	here	at	TED	in	2007	on	Virtual	Earth	,	brought	me	over	to	become	the	architect	of	Bing	Maps	,	which	is	Microsoft	's	 online 	 - 	 mapping 	 	effort	.
In	the	past	two	and	a	half	,	we	've	been	very	hard	at	work	on	 re 	 defining 	 	the	way	maps	work	online	.
And	we	 re 	 ally 	 	are	seeing	this	in	very	different	terms	from	the	kind	of	mapping	and	direction	site	that	one	is	used	to	.
So	,	the	first	thing	that	you	might	notice	about	the	mapping	site	is	just	the	 fluid 	 ity 	 	of	the	 zoom 	 ing 	 	and	the	panning	,	which	,	if	you	're	familiar	at	all	with	 Sea 	 dragon 	 	,	that	's	where	it	comes	from	.
Mapping	is	,	of	course	,	not	just	about	cartography	,	it	's	also	about	imagery	.
So	,	as	we	 zoom 	 - 	 in 	 	beyond	a	certain	level	this	 resolve 	 s 	 	into	a	kind	of	Sim	 City 	 - 	 like 	 	virtual	view	at	45	degrees	.
This	can	be	viewed	from	any	of	the	cardinal	 direction 	 s 	 	to	show	you	the	3D	structure	of	the	city	,	all	the	 facade 	 s 	 	.
Now	,	we	see	this	space	,	this	 three 	 - 	 dimensional 	 	environment	,	as	being	a	canvas	on	which	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	applications	can	play	out	,	and	map	's	 direction 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	just	one	of	them	.
If	you	click	on	this	,	you	'll	see	some	of	the	ones	that	we	've	put	out	,	just	in	the	past	couple	of	months	since	we	've	launched	.
So	,	for	example	,	a	couple	of	days	after	the	disaster	in	Haiti	,	we	had	an	earthquake	map	that	 show 	 ed 	 	before	and	after	pictures	from	the	sky	.
This	wonderful	one	which	I	do	n't	have	time	to	show	you	is	taking	 hyper 	 - 	 local 	 	blogs	in	real	time	and	mapping	those	stories	,	those	entries	to	the	places	that	are	referred	to	on	the	blogs	.
It	's	wonderful	.
But	I	'm	going	to	show	you	some	more	candy	sort	of	stuff	.
So	,	we	see	the	imagery	,	of	course	,	not	stopping	at	the	sky	.
These	little	green	 bubble 	 s 	 	represent	 photo 	 synth 	 s 	 	that	users	have	made	.
I	'm	not	going	to	dive	into	them	either	,	but	 photo 	 synth 	 s 	 	are	integrated	into	the	map	.
Everything	that	's	cased	in	blue	is	an	area	where	we	've	taken	imagery	on	the	ground	as	well	.
Now	,	I	'll	show	you	a	fun	app	that	--	we	've	been	working	on	a	collaboration	with	our	friends	at	Flickr	.
This	takes	Flickr	,	 geo 	 registered 	 	imagery	and	uses	 photo 	 synth 	 - 	 like 	 	processes	to	connect	that	imagery	to	our	imagery	,	so	--	I	'm	not	sure	if	that	's	the	one	I	actually	meant	to	pull	up	,	but	--	But	notice	--	this	is	,	of	course	,	a	popular	tourist	site	,	and	there	are	lots	of	photos	around	here	,	and	these	photos	are	all	taken	at	different	times	.
So	this	one	was	taken	around	five	.
So	that	's	the	Flickr	photo	,	that	's	our	imagery	.
So	you	 re 	 ally 	 	see	how	this	kind	of	 crowd 	 - 	 sourced 	 	imagery	is	integrating	,	in	a	very	deep	way	,	into	the	map	itself	.
Thank	you	.
There	are	several	reasons	why	this	is	 interest 	 ing 	 	and	one	of	them	,	of	course	,	is	time	travel	.
And	I	'm	not	going	to	show	you	some	of	the	wonderful	historic	imagery	in	here	,	but	there	are	some	with	horses	and	 carriage 	 s 	 	and	so	on	as	well	.
But	what	's	cool	about	this	is	that	,	not	only	is	it	 augment 	 ing 	 	this	visual	representation	of	the	world	with	things	that	are	coming	in	from	users	,	but	it	also	is	the	foundation	for	augmented	reality	,	and	that	's	something	that	I	'll	be	showing	you	more	of	in	just	a	moment	.
Now	I	just	made	a	transition	 indoor 	 s 	 	.	That	's	also	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
OK	,	notice	there	's	now	a	roof	above	us	.
We	're	inside	the	Pike	Place	Market	.
And	this	is	something	that	we	're	able	to	do	with	a	backpack	camera	,	so	,	we	're	now	not	only	imaging	in	the	street	with	this	camera	on	tops	of	cars	,	but	we	're	also	imaging	inside	.
And	from	here	,	we	're	able	to	do	the	same	 sort 	 s 	 	of	registration	,	not	only	of	still	images	,	but	also	of	video	.
So	this	is	something	that	we	're	now	going	to	try	for	the	first	time	,	live	,	and	this	is	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 tru 	 ly 	 	,	very	 frighten 	 ing 	 	.
OK	.
All	right	,	guys	,	are	you	there	?
All	right	.	I	'm	hitting	it	.	I	'm	 punch 	 ing 	 	play	.
I	'm	live	.	All	right	.	There	we	go	.
So	,	these	are	our	friends	in	Pike	Place	Market	,	the	lab	.
So	they	're	broadcasting	this	live	.
OK	,	George	,	can	you	pan	back	over	to	the	corner	market	?
Because	I	want	to	show	points	of	interest	.
No	,	no	.	The	other	way	.
Yeah	,	yeah	,	back	to	the	corner	,	back	to	the	corner	.
I	do	n't	want	to	see	you	guys	yet	.
OK	,	OK	,	back	to	the	corner	,	back	to	the	corner	,	back	to	the	corner	.
OK	,	never	mind	.
What	I	wanted	to	show	you	was	these	points	of	interest	over	here	on	top	of	the	image	because	what	that	gives	you	a	sense	of	is	the	way	,	if	you	're	actually	on	the	spot	,	you	can	think	about	this	--	this	is	taking	a	step	in	addition	to	augmented	reality	.
What	the	hell	are	you	guys	--	oh	,	sorry	.
We	're	 do 	 ing 	 	two	different	--	OK	,	I	'm	hanging	up	now	.
We	're	 do 	 ing 	 	two	different	things	here	.
One	of	them	is	to	take	that	real	...
All	right	,	let	me	just	take	a	moment	and	thank	the	team	.
They	've	done	a	fantastic	job	of	pulling	this	together	.
I	'm	going	to	abandon	them	now	and	walk	back	outside	.
And	while	I	walk	outside	,	I	'll	just	mention	that	here	we	're	 us 	 ing 	 	this	for	 tele 	 presence 	 	,	but	you	can	 e 	 qually 	 	well	use	this	on	the	spot	,	for	augmented	reality	.
When	you	use	it	on	the	spot	,	it	means	that	you	're	able	to	bring	all	of	that	metadata	and	information	about	the	world	to	you	.
So	here	,	we	're	taking	the	extra	step	of	also	broadcasting	it	.
That	was	being	broadcast	,	by	the	way	,	on	a	4G	network	from	the	market	.
All	right	,	and	now	there	's	one	last	TED	talk	that	Microsoft	has	given	in	the	past	several	years	.
And	that	's	Curtis	Wong	,	WorldWide	Telescope	.
So	,	we	're	going	to	head	over	to	the	 dump 	 sters 	 	,	where	it	's	traditional	,	after	a	long	day	at	the	market	,	to	go	out	for	a	break	,	but	also	 star 	 e 	 	up	at	the	sky	.
This	is	the	integration	of	WorldWide	Telescope	into	our	maps	.
This	is	the	current	--	thank	you	--	this	is	the	current	time	.	If	we	scrub	the	time	,	then	we	can	see	how	the	sky	will	look	at	different	times	,	and	we	can	get	all	of	this	very	detailed	information	about	different	times	,	different	dates	:	Let	's	move	the	moon	a	little	higher	in	the	sky	,	maybe	change	the	date	.
I	would	like	to	kind	of	zoom	in	on	the	moon	.
So	,	this	is	an	 astronomical 	 ly 	 	complete	representation	of	the	sky	integrated	right	into	the	Earth	.
All	right	now	,	I	've	 over 	 run 	 	my	time	,	so	I	've	got	to	stop	.
Thank	you	all	very	much	.

Eve	 Ens 	 ler 	 	:	Suddenly	,	my	body
For	a	long	time	,	there	was	me	,	and	my	body	.
Me	was	composed	of	stories	,	of	 crav 	 ings 	 	,	of	 striv 	 ings 	 	,	of	 desire 	 s 	 	of	the	future	.
Me	was	 try 	 ing 	 	not	to	be	an	outcome	of	my	violent	past	,	but	the	separation	that	had	already	occurred	between	me	and	my	body	was	a	pretty	significant	outcome	.
Me	was	always	 try 	 ing 	 	to	become	something	,	 some 	 body 	 	.
Me	only	existed	in	the	 try 	 ing 	 	.
My	body	was	often	in	the	way	.
Me	was	a	floating	head	.
For	years	,	I	actually	only	wore	 hat 	 s 	 	.
It	was	a	way	of	keeping	my	head	attached	.
It	was	a	way	of	locating	myself	.
I	worried	that	[	if	]	I	took	my	hat	off	I	would	n't	be	here	 any 	 more 	 	.
I	actually	had	a	therapist	who	once	said	to	me	,	``	Eve	,	you	've	been	coming	here	for	two	years	,	and	,	to	be	honest	,	it	never	occurred	to	me	that	you	had	a	body	.	''
All	this	time	I	lived	in	the	city	because	,	to	be	honest	,	I	was	afraid	of	trees	.
I	never	had	babies	because	heads	can	not	give	birth	.
Babies	actually	do	n't	come	out	of	your	mouth	.
As	I	had	no	reference	point	for	my	body	,	I	began	to	ask	other	women	about	their	bodies	--	in	particular	,	their	 vagina 	 s 	 	,	because	I	thought	 vagina 	 s 	 	were	kind	of	important	.
This	led	to	me	writing	``	The	Vagina	 Mono 	 logues 	 	,	''	which	led	to	me	 obsessive 	 ly 	 	and	 incess 	 antly 	 	talking	about	 vagina 	 s 	 	everywhere	I	could	.
I	did	this	in	front	of	many	 stranger 	 s 	 	.
One	night	on	stage	,	I	actually	entered	my	vagina	.
It	was	an	ecstatic	experience	.
It	scared	me	,	it	energized	me	,	and	then	I	became	a	driven	person	,	a	driven	vagina	.
I	began	to	see	my	body	like	a	thing	,	a	thing	that	could	move	fast	,	like	a	thing	that	could	accomplish	other	things	,	many	things	,	all	at	once	.
I	began	to	see	my	body	like	an	iPad	or	a	car	.
I	would	drive	it	and	demand	things	from	it	.
It	had	no	limits	.	It	was	 in 	 vincible 	 	.
It	was	to	be	 conquer 	 ed 	 	and	 master 	 ed 	 	like	the	Earth	herself	.
I	did	n't	heed	it	;	no	,	I	organized	it	and	I	directed	it	.
I	did	n't	have	patience	for	my	body	;	I	 s 	 napped 	 	it	into	shape	.
I	was	 greed 	 y 	 	.
I	took	more	than	my	body	had	to	offer	.
If	I	was	tired	,	I	 d 	 rank 	 	more	 espresso 	 s 	 	.
If	I	was	afraid	,	I	went	to	more	dangerous	places	.
Oh	sure	,	sure	,	I	had	 moment 	 s 	 	of	appreciation	of	my	body	,	the	way	an	abusive	parent	can	sometimes	have	a	moment	of	kindness	.
My	father	was	 re 	 ally 	 	kind	to	me	on	my	16th	birthday	,	for	example	.
I	heard	people	murmur	from	time	to	time	that	I	should	love	my	body	,	so	I	learned	how	to	do	this	.
I	was	a	vegetarian	,	I	was	sober	,	I	did	n't	smoke	.
But	all	that	was	just	a	more	 s 	 ophisticated 	 	way	to	 manipulat 	 e 	 	my	body	--	a	further	 dis 	 association 	 	,	like	planting	a	vegetable	field	on	a	 free 	 way 	 	.
As	a	result	of	me	talking	so	much	about	my	vagina	,	many	women	started	to	tell	me	about	 their 	 s 	 	--	their	stories	about	their	bodies	.
Actually	,	these	stories	 compell 	 ed 	 	me	around	the	world	,	and	I	've	been	to	over	60	countries	.
I	heard	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	stories	,	and	I	have	to	tell	you	,	there	was	always	this	moment	where	the	women	shared	with	me	that	particular	moment	when	she	separated	from	her	body	--	when	she	left	home	.
I	heard	about	women	being	 molest 	 ed 	 	in	their	beds	,	 f 	 logged 	 	in	their	 burq 	 as 	 	,	left	for	dead	in	parking	lots	,	acid	burned	in	their	 kitchen 	 s 	 	.
Some	women	became	quiet	and	 disappear 	 ed 	 	.
Other	women	became	mad	,	driven	machines	like	me	.
In	the	middle	of	my	 travel 	 ing 	 	,	I	turned	40	and	I	began	to	hate	my	body	,	which	was	actually	progress	,	because	at	least	my	body	existed	enough	to	hate	it	.
Well	my	stomach	--	it	was	my	stomach	I	 h 	 ated 	 	.
It	was	proof	that	I	had	not	measured	up	,	that	I	was	old	and	not	fabulous	and	not	perfect	or	able	to	fit	into	the	 pre 	 determined 	 	corporate	image	in	shape	.
My	stomach	was	proof	that	I	had	failed	,	that	it	had	failed	me	,	that	it	was	broken	.
My	life	became	about	getting	rid	of	it	and	 obsess 	 ing 	 	about	getting	rid	of	it	.
In	fact	,	it	became	so	extreme	I	wrote	a	play	about	it	.
But	the	more	I	talked	about	it	,	the	more	 object 	 ified 	 	and	 fragment 	 ed 	 	my	body	became	.
It	became	entertainment	;	it	became	a	new	kind	of	commodity	,	something	I	was	selling	.
Then	I	went	 s 	 omewhere 	 	else	.
I	went	outside	what	I	thought	I	knew	.
I	went	to	the	Democratic	Republic	of	Congo	.
And	I	heard	stories	that	 shatter 	 ed 	 	all	the	other	stories	.
I	heard	stories	that	got	inside	my	body	.
I	heard	about	a	little	girl	who	could	n't	stop	 pee 	 ing 	 	on	herself	because	so	many	grown	soldiers	had	 s 	 hoved 	 	themselves	inside	her	.
I	heard	an	80-year-old	woman	whose	legs	were	broken	and	 pull 	 ed 	 	out	of	her	sockets	and	twisted	up	on	her	head	as	the	soldiers	 rap 	 ed 	 	her	like	that	.
There	are	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	these	stories	,	and	many	of	the	women	had	holes	in	their	bodies	--	holes	,	fistula	--	that	were	the	violation	of	war	--	holes	in	the	fabric	of	their	 soul 	 s 	 	.
These	stories	saturated	my	cells	and	nerves	,	and	to	be	honest	,	I	stopped	sleeping	for	three	years	.
All	the	stories	began	to	bleed	together	.
The	 ra 	 ping 	 	of	the	Earth	,	the	 pilla 	 ging 	 	of	minerals	,	the	destruction	of	 vagina 	 s 	 	--	none	of	these	were	separate	 any 	 more 	 	from	each	other	or	me	.
 Militia 	 s 	 	were	 ra 	 ping 	 	 six 	 - 	 month 	 - 	 old 	 	babies	so	that	countries	far	away	could	get	access	to	gold	and	 col 	 tan 	 	for	their	 iPhone 	 s 	 	and	computers	.
My	body	had	not	only	become	a	driven	machine	,	but	it	was	 responsibl 	 e 	 	now	for	 destroy 	 ing 	 	other	women	's	bodies	in	its	mad	quest	to	make	more	machines	to	support	the	speed	and	efficiency	of	my	machine	.
Then	I	got	cancer	--	or	I	found	out	I	had	cancer	.
It	 arriv 	 ed 	 	like	a	 speed 	 ing 	 	bird	 smash 	 ing 	 	into	a	 window 	 pane 	 	.
Suddenly	,	I	had	a	body	,	a	body	that	was	 prick 	 ed 	 	and	poked	and	 puncture 	 d 	 	,	a	body	that	was	cut	wide	open	,	a	body	that	had	organs	removed	and	 transport 	 ed 	 	and	 re 	 arranged 	 	and	 re 	 constructed 	 	,	a	body	that	was	scanned	and	had	tubes	 s 	 hoved 	 	down	it	,	a	body	that	was	burning	from	chemicals	.
Cancer	exploded	the	wall	of	my	 dis 	 connection 	 	.
I	 sudden 	 ly 	 	understood	that	the	crisis	in	my	body	was	the	crisis	in	the	world	,	and	it	was	n't	happening	later	,	it	was	happening	now	.
Suddenly	,	my	cancer	was	a	cancer	that	was	everywhere	,	the	cancer	of	cruelty	,	the	cancer	of	greed	,	the	cancer	that	 get 	 s 	 	inside	people	who	live	down	the	streets	from	chemical	plants	--	and	they	're	usually	poor	--	the	cancer	inside	the	coal	miner	's	lungs	,	the	cancer	of	stress	for	not	achieving	enough	,	the	cancer	of	buried	trauma	,	the	cancer	in	caged	 chicken 	 s 	 	and	polluted	fish	,	the	cancer	in	women	's	 uter 	 uses 	 	from	being	 rap 	 ed 	 	,	the	cancer	that	is	everywhere	from	our	 care 	 lessness 	 	.
In	his	new	and	 vision 	 ary 	 	book	,	``	New	Self	,	New	World	,	''	the	writer	Philip	Shepherd	says	,	``	If	you	are	divided	from	your	body	,	you	are	also	divided	from	the	body	of	the	world	,	which	then	appears	to	be	other	than	you	or	separate	from	you	,	rather	than	the	living	continuum	to	which	you	belong	.	''
Before	cancer	,	the	world	was	something	other	.
It	was	as	if	I	was	living	in	a	 stagn 	 ant 	 	pool	and	cancer	 dynamite 	 d 	 	the	boulder	that	was	 separat 	 ing 	 	me	from	the	larger	sea	.
Now	I	am	swimming	in	it	.
Now	I	lay	down	in	the	grass	and	I	rub	my	body	in	it	,	and	I	love	the	mud	on	my	legs	and	feet	.
Now	I	make	a	daily	pilgrimage	to	visit	a	particular	weeping	willow	by	the	Seine	,	and	I	hunger	for	the	green	fields	in	the	bush	outside	 Bu 	 kavu 	 	.
And	when	it	 rain 	 s 	 	hard	rain	,	I	scream	and	I	run	in	circles	.
I	know	that	everything	is	connected	,	and	the	scar	that	runs	the	length	of	my	torso	is	the	 marking 	 s 	 	of	the	earthquake	.
And	I	am	there	with	the	three	million	in	the	streets	of	 Port 	 - 	 au 	 - 	 Prince 	 	.
And	the	fire	that	burned	in	me	on	day	three	through	six	of	chemo	is	the	fire	that	is	burning	in	the	 forest 	 s 	 	of	the	world	.
I	know	that	the	abscess	that	grew	around	my	wound	after	the	operation	,	the	16	 ounce 	 s 	 	of	puss	,	is	the	 contaminate 	 d 	 	Gulf	of	Mexico	,	and	there	were	 oil 	 - 	 drenched 	 	 pelican 	 s 	 	inside	me	and	dead	floating	fish	.
And	the	 catheter 	 s 	 	they	 s 	 hoved 	 	into	me	without	proper	medication	made	me	scream	out	the	way	the	Earth	cries	out	from	the	drilling	.
In	my	second	chemo	,	my	mother	got	very	sick	and	I	went	to	see	her	.
And	in	the	name	of	 connected 	 ness 	 	,	the	only	thing	she	wanted	before	she	died	was	to	be	brought	home	by	her	beloved	Gulf	of	Mexico	.
So	we	brought	her	home	,	and	I	prayed	that	the	oil	would	n't	wash	up	on	her	beach	before	she	died	.
And	 grateful 	 ly 	 	,	it	did	n't	.
And	she	died	 quiet 	 ly 	 	in	her	 favorit 	 e 	 	place	.
And	a	few	weeks	later	,	I	was	in	New	Orleans	,	and	this	beautiful	,	spiritual	friend	told	me	she	wanted	to	do	a	healing	for	me	.
And	I	was	 honor 	 ed 	 	.
And	I	went	to	her	house	,	and	it	was	morning	,	and	the	morning	New	Orleans	sun	was	filtering	through	the	 curtain 	 s 	 	.
And	my	friend	was	preparing	this	big	bowl	,	and	I	said	,	``	What	is	it	?	''
And	she	said	,	``	It	's	for	you	.
The	flowers	make	it	beautiful	,	and	the	honey	makes	it	sweet	.	''
And	I	said	,	``	But	what	's	the	water	part	?	''
And	in	the	name	of	 connected 	 ness 	 	,	she	said	,	``	Oh	,	it	's	the	Gulf	of	Mexico	.	''
And	I	said	,	``	Of	course	it	is	.	''
And	the	other	women	 arriv 	 ed 	 	and	they	sat	in	a	circle	,	and	 Michael 	 a 	 	 bath 	 ed 	 	my	head	with	the	sacred	water	.
And	she	sang	--	I	mean	her	whole	body	sang	.
And	the	other	women	sang	and	they	prayed	for	me	and	my	mother	.
And	as	the	warm	Gulf	washed	over	my	naked	head	,	I	 re 	 alized 	 	that	it	held	the	best	and	the	worst	of	us	.
It	was	the	greed	and	 reckless 	 ness 	 	that	led	to	the	drilling	explosion	.
It	was	all	the	lies	that	got	told	before	and	after	.
It	was	the	honey	in	the	water	that	made	it	sweet	,	it	was	the	oil	that	made	it	sick	.
It	was	my	head	that	was	bald	--	and	 comfortabl 	 e 	 	now	without	a	hat	.
It	was	my	whole	self	melting	into	 Michael 	 a 	 	's	lap	.
It	was	the	tears	that	were	 in 	 distinguishable 	 	from	the	Gulf	that	were	 fall 	 ing 	 	down	my	cheek	.
It	was	finally	being	in	my	body	.
It	was	the	sorrow	that	's	taken	so	long	.
It	was	finding	my	place	and	the	huge	responsibility	that	comes	with	connection	.
It	was	the	 continu 	 ing 	 	 deva 	 stating 	 	war	in	the	Congo	and	the	 in 	 difference 	 	of	the	world	.
It	was	the	 Congo 	 lese 	 	women	who	are	now	rising	up	.
It	was	my	mother	leaving	,	just	at	the	moment	that	I	was	being	born	.
It	was	the	 re 	 alization 	 	that	I	had	come	very	close	to	dying	--	in	the	same	way	that	the	Earth	,	our	mother	,	is	 bare 	 ly 	 	holding	on	,	in	the	same	way	that	75	percent	of	the	planet	are	 hard 	 ly 	 	 scrap 	 ing 	 	by	,	in	the	same	way	that	there	is	a	recipe	for	survival	.
What	I	learned	is	it	has	to	do	with	attention	and	resources	that	everybody	 de 	 serves 	 	.
It	was	 advocat 	 ing 	 	friends	and	a	 dot 	 ing 	 	sister	.
It	was	wise	doctors	and	advanced	medicine	and	 surgeon 	 s 	 	who	knew	what	to	do	with	their	hands	.
It	was	 under 	 paid 	 	and	 re 	 ally 	 	loving	nurses	.
It	was	magic	 healer 	 s 	 	and	aromatic	 oil 	 s 	 	.
It	was	people	who	came	with	spells	and	 ritual 	 s 	 	.
It	was	having	a	vision	of	the	future	and	something	to	fight	for	,	because	I	know	this	struggle	is	n't	my	own	.
It	was	a	million	prayers	.
It	was	a	thousand	 ha 	 llelujah 	 s 	 	and	a	million	oms	.
It	was	a	lot	of	anger	,	insane	humor	,	a	lot	of	attention	,	 outrag 	 e 	 	.
It	was	energy	,	love	and	joy	.
It	was	all	these	things	.
It	was	all	these	things	.
It	was	all	these	things	in	the	water	,	in	the	world	,	in	my	body	.

 Soph 	 al 	 	Ear	:	 E 	 scaping 	 	the	Khmer	Rouge
I	 normal 	 ly 	 	teach	courses	on	how	to	rebuild	states	after	war	.
But	today	I	've	got	a	personal	story	to	share	with	you	.
This	is	a	picture	of	my	family	,	my	four	siblings	--	my	mom	and	I	--	taken	in	1977	.
And	we	're	actually	 Cambodian 	 s 	 	.
And	this	picture	is	taken	in	Vietnam	.
So	how	did	a	Cambodian	family	end	up	in	Vietnam	in	1977	?
Well	to	explain	that	,	I	've	got	a	short	video	clip	to	explain	the	Khmer	Rouge	regime	during	1975	and	1979	.
Video	:	April	17th	,	1975	.
The	communist	Khmer	Rouge	enters	Phnom	Penh	to	liberate	their	people	from	the	 encroach 	 ing 	 	conflict	in	Vietnam	,	and	American	bombing	campaigns	.
Led	by	 peasant 	 - 	 born 	 	Pol	Pot	,	the	Khmer	Rouge	 evacuate 	 s 	 	people	to	the	countryside	in	order	to	create	a	rural	communist	utopia	,	much	like	Mao	 Tse 	 - 	 tung 	 	's	Cultural	Revolution	in	China	.
The	Khmer	Rouge	closes	the	doors	to	the	outside	world	.
But	after	four	years	the	grim	truth	 seep 	 s 	 	out	.
In	a	country	of	only	seven	million	people	,	one	and	a	half	million	were	 murder 	 ed 	 	by	their	own	leaders	,	their	bodies	 pil 	 ed 	 	in	the	mass	graves	of	the	killing	fields	.
 Soph 	 al 	 	Ear	:	So	,	 n 	 otwithstanding 	 	the	1970s	narration	,	on	April	17th	1975	we	lived	in	Phnom	Penh	.
And	my	parents	were	told	by	the	Khmer	Rouge	to	evacuate	the	city	because	of	 impend 	 ing 	 	American	bombing	for	three	days	.
And	here	is	a	picture	of	the	Khmer	Rouge	.
They	were	young	soldiers	,	typically	child	soldiers	.
And	this	is	very	normal	now	,	of	modern	day	conflict	,	because	they	're	easy	to	bring	into	wars	.
The	reason	that	they	gave	about	American	bombing	was	n't	all	that	far	off	.
I	mean	,	from	1965	to	1973	there	were	more	 munition 	 s 	 	that	fell	on	Cambodia	than	in	all	of	World	War	II	Japan	,	including	the	two	nuclear	bombs	of	August	1945	.
The	Khmer	Rouge	did	n't	believe	in	money	.
So	the	equivalent	of	the	Federal	Reserve	Bank	in	Cambodia	was	 bomb 	 ed 	 	.
But	not	just	that	,	they	actually	banned	money	.
I	think	it	's	the	only	precedent	in	which	money	has	ever	been	stopped	from	being	used	.
And	we	know	money	is	the	root	of	all	evil	,	but	it	did	n't	actually	stop	evil	from	happening	in	Cambodia	,	in	fact	.
My	family	was	moved	from	Phnom	Penh	to	 Pur 	 sat 	 	province	.
This	is	a	picture	of	what	 Pur 	 sat 	 	looks	like	.
It	's	actually	a	very	pretty	area	of	Cambodia	,	where	rice	growing	takes	place	.
And	in	fact	they	were	forced	to	work	the	fields	.
So	my	father	and	mother	ended	up	in	a	sort	of	concentration	camp	,	labor	camp	.
And	it	was	at	that	time	that	my	mother	got	word	from	the	commune	chief	that	the	Vietnamese	were	actually	 as 	 king 	 	for	their	citizens	to	go	back	to	Vietnam	.
And	she	spoke	some	Vietnamese	,	as	a	child	having	grown	up	with	Vietnamese	friends	.
And	she	decided	,	 despit 	 e 	 	the	advice	of	her	 neighbor 	 s 	 	,	that	she	would	take	the	chance	and	claim	to	be	Vietnamese	so	that	we	could	have	a	chance	to	survive	,	because	at	this	point	they	're	forcing	everybody	to	work	.
And	they	're	giving	about	--	in	a	 modern 	 - 	 day 	 	,	 caloric 	 - 	 restriction 	 	diet	,	I	guess	--	they	're	giving	porridge	,	with	a	few	grains	of	rice	.
And	at	about	this	time	actually	my	father	got	very	sick	.
And	he	did	n't	speak	Vietnamese	.
So	he	died	actually	,	in	January	1976	.
And	it	made	it	possible	,	in	fact	,	for	us	to	take	on	this	plan	.
So	the	Khmer	Rouge	took	us	from	a	place	called	 Pur 	 sat 	 	to	Kaoh	 Ti 	 ev 	 	,	which	is	across	from	the	border	from	Vietnam	.
And	there	they	had	a	detention	camp	where	alleged	Vietnamese	would	be	tested	,	language	tested	.
And	my	mother	's	Vietnamese	was	so	bad	that	to	make	our	story	more	credible	,	she	'd	given	all	the	boys	and	girls	new	Vietnamese	names	.
But	she	'd	given	the	boys	girls	'	names	,	and	the	girls	boys	'	names	.
And	it	was	n't	until	she	met	a	Vietnamese	lady	who	told	her	this	,	and	then	 tutor 	 ed 	 	her	for	two	days	 intensive 	 ly 	 	,	that	she	was	able	to	go	into	her	exam	and	--	you	know	,	this	was	a	moment	of	truth	.
If	she	 fail 	 s 	 	,	we	're	all	headed	to	the	gallows	;	if	she	passes	,	we	can	leave	to	Vietnam	.
And	she	actually	,	of	course	--	I	'm	here	,	she	passes	.
And	we	end	up	in	Hong	Ngu	on	the	Vietnamese	side	.
And	then	onwards	to	Chau	Doc	.
And	this	is	a	picture	of	Hong	Ngu	,	Vietnam	today	.
A	pretty	 idyll 	 ic 	 	place	on	the	Mekong	Delta	.
But	for	us	it	meant	freedom	.
And	freedom	from	persecution	from	the	Khmer	Rouge	.
Last	year	,	the	Khmer	Rouge	Tribunal	,	which	the	U.N.	is	 help 	 ing 	 	Cambodia	take	on	,	started	,	and	I	decided	that	as	a	matter	of	record	I	should	file	a	Civil	Complaint	with	the	Tribunal	about	my	father	's	passing	away	.
And	I	got	word	last	month	that	the	complaint	was	 official 	 ly 	 	accepted	by	the	Khmer	Rouge	Tribunal	.
And	it	's	for	me	a	matter	of	justice	for	history	,	and	accountability	for	the	future	,	because	Cambodia	remains	a	pretty	 law 	 less 	 	place	,	at	times	.
Five	years	ago	my	mother	and	I	went	back	to	Chau	Doc	.
And	she	was	able	to	return	to	a	place	that	for	her	meant	freedom	,	but	also	fear	,	because	we	had	just	come	out	of	Cambodia	.
I	'm	happy	,	actually	,	today	,	to	present	her	.
She	's	here	today	with	us	in	the	audience	.
Thank	you	mother	.

Inge	 Miss 	 mahl 	 	 bring 	 s 	 	peace	to	the	minds	of	Afghanistan
So	I	want	to	tell	you	a	story	--	an	 encourag 	 ing 	 	story	--	about	 address 	 ing 	 	 desperat 	 ion 	 	,	depression	and	despair	in	Afghanistan	,	and	what	we	have	learned	from	it	,	and	how	to	help	people	to	 overcom 	 e 	 	traumatic	 experience 	 s 	 	and	how	to	help	them	to	regain	some	confidence	in	the	time	 a 	 head 	 	--	in	the	future	--	and	how	to	participate	again	in	everyday	life	.
So	,	I	am	a	 Jung 	 ian 	 	 psycho 	 analyst 	 	,	and	I	went	to	Afghanistan	in	January	2004	,	by	chance	,	on	an	assignment	for	Medica	 Mondial 	 e 	 	.
Jung	in	Afghanistan	--	you	get	the	picture	.
Afghanistan	is	one	of	the	 poor 	 est 	 	countries	in	the	world	,	and	70	percent	of	the	people	are	 il 	 literate 	 	.
War	and	 mal 	 nutrition 	 	kills	people	together	with	hope	.
You	may	know	this	from	the	media	,	but	what	you	may	not	know	is	that	the	average	age	of	the	Afghan	people	is	17	years	old	,	which	means	they	grow	up	in	such	an	environment	and	--	I	repeat	myself	--	in	30	years	of	war	.
So	this	 translate 	 s 	 	into	 ongo 	 ing 	 	violence	,	foreign	interests	,	 bribe 	 ry 	 	,	drugs	,	ethnic	 conflict 	 s 	 	,	bad	health	,	shame	,	fear	and	cumulative	traumatic	 experience 	 s 	 	.
Local	and	foreign	military	are	 s 	 upposed 	 	to	build	peace	together	with	the	 donor 	 s 	 	and	the	governmental	and	 non 	 - 	 governmental 	 	organizations	.
And	people	had	hope	,	yes	,	but	until	they	 re 	 alized 	 	their	situation	 worsen 	 s 	 	every	day	--	either	because	they	are	being	killed	or	because	,	 some 	 how 	 	,	they	are	 poor 	 er 	 	than	eight	years	ago	.
One	figure	for	that	:	54	percent	of	the	children	under	the	age	of	five	years	suffer	from	 mal 	 nutrition 	 	.
Yet	,	there	is	hope	.
One	day	a	man	told	me	,	``	My	future	does	not	look	brilliant	,	but	I	want	to	have	a	brilliant	future	for	my	son	.	''
This	is	a	picture	I	took	in	2005	,	walking	on	 Friday 	 s 	 	over	the	hills	in	Kabul	,	and	for	me	it	's	a	symbolic	picture	of	an	open	future	for	a	young	generation	.
So	,	doctors	prescribe	medication	.
And	 donor 	 s 	 	are	 s 	 upposed 	 	to	bring	peace	by	building	schools	and	roads	.
Military	collect	weapons	,	and	depression	 stay 	 s 	 	intact	.
Why	?
Because	people	do	n't	have	tools	to	cope	with	it	,	to	get	over	it	.
So	,	soon	after	my	arrival	,	I	had	confirmed	something	which	I	had	already	known	;	that	my	instruments	come	from	the	heart	of	modern	Europe	,	yes	.
However	,	what	can	wound	us	and	our	reaction	to	those	 wound 	 s 	 	--	they	are	universal	.
And	the	big	challenge	was	how	to	understand	the	meaning	of	the	symptom	in	this	specific	cultural	context	.
After	a	 counsel 	 ing 	 	session	,	a	woman	said	to	me	,	``	Because	you	have	felt	me	,	I	can	feel	myself	again	,	and	I	want	to	participate	again	in	my	family	life	.	''
This	was	very	important	,	because	the	family	is	central	in	 Afghan 	 s 	 	'	social	system	.
No	one	can	survive	alone	.
And	if	people	feel	used	,	 worth 	 less 	 	and	ashamed	,	because	something	 h 	 orrible 	 	has	happened	to	them	,	then	they	retreat	,	and	they	fall	into	social	isolation	,	and	they	do	not	dare	to	tell	this	evil	to	other	people	or	to	their	loved	ones	,	because	they	do	not	want	to	burden	them	.
And	very	often	violence	is	a	way	to	cope	with	it	.
 Trauma 	 tized 	 	people	also	easily	lose	control	--	symptoms	are	 hyper 	 - 	 arousal 	 	and	memory	 flash 	 backs 	 	--	so	people	are	in	a	constant	fear	that	those	 h 	 orrible 	 	 feeling 	 s 	 	of	that	traumatic	event	might	come	back	 unexpected 	 ly 	 	,	 sudden 	 ly 	 	,	and	they	can	not	control	it	.
To	compensate	this	loss	of	inner	control	,	they	try	to	control	the	outside	,	very	 understand 	 ably 	 	--	mostly	the	family	--	and	 unfortunat 	 ely 	 	,	this	fits	very	well	into	the	traditional	side	,	 re 	 gressive 	 	side	,	 re 	 pressive 	 	side	,	 restrict 	 ive 	 	side	of	the	cultural	context	.
So	,	 husband 	 s 	 	start	beating	wives	,	mothers	and	 father 	 s 	 	beat	their	children	,	and	afterward	,	they	feel	awful	.
They	did	not	want	to	do	this	,	it	just	happened	--	they	lost	control	.
The	 desperat 	 e 	 	try	to	restore	order	and	normality	,	and	if	we	are	not	able	to	cut	this	circle	of	violence	,	it	will	be	transferred	to	the	next	generation	without	a	doubt	.
And	 part 	 ly 	 	this	is	already	happening	.
So	everybody	needs	a	sense	for	the	future	,	and	the	Afghan	sense	of	the	future	is	 shatter 	 ed 	 	.
But	let	me	repeat	the	words	of	the	woman	.
``	Because	you	have	felt	me	,	I	can	feel	myself	again	.	''
So	the	key	here	is	empathy	.
 Some 	 body 	 	has	to	be	a	witness	to	what	has	happened	to	you	.
 Some 	 body 	 	has	to	feel	how	you	felt	.
And	 some 	 body 	 	has	to	see	you	and	listen	to	you	.
Everybody	must	be	able	to	know	what	he	or	she	has	 experience 	 d 	 	is	true	,	and	this	only	goes	with	another	person	.
So	everybody	must	be	able	to	say	,	``	This	happened	to	me	,	and	it	did	this	with	me	,	but	I	'm	able	to	live	with	it	,	to	cope	with	it	,	and	to	learn	from	it	.
And	I	want	to	engage	myself	in	the	bright	future	for	my	children	and	the	children	of	my	children	,	and	I	will	not	 marry 	 - 	 off 	 	my	13	 year 	 - 	 old 	 	daughter	,	''	--	what	 happen 	 s 	 	too	often	in	Afghanistan	.
So	something	can	be	done	,	even	in	such	extreme	 environment 	 s 	 	as	Afghanistan	.
And	I	started	thinking	about	a	 counsel 	 ing 	 	program	.
But	,	of	course	,	I	needed	help	and	funds	.
And	one	evening	,	I	was	sitting	next	to	a	very	nice	gentleman	in	Kabul	,	and	he	asked	what	I	thought	would	be	good	in	Afghanistan	.
And	I	explained	to	him	quickly	,	I	would	train	 psycho 	 - 	 social 	 	 counsel 	 ors 	 	,	I	would	open	centers	,	and	I	explained	to	him	why	.
This	man	gave	me	his	contact	details	at	the	end	of	the	evening	and	said	,	``	If	you	want	to	do	this	,	call	me	.	''
At	that	time	,	it	was	the	head	of	 Car 	 itas 	 	Germany	.
So	,	I	was	able	to	launch	a	 three 	 - 	 year 	 	project	with	 Car 	 itas 	 	Germany	,	and	we	trained	30	Afghan	women	and	men	,	and	we	opened	15	 counsel 	 ing 	 	centers	in	Kabul	.
This	was	our	sign	--	it	's	 hand 	 - 	 painted 	 	,	and	we	had	45	all	over	Kabul	.
Eleven	thousand	people	came	--	more	than	that	.
And	70	percent	 re 	 gained 	 	their	lives	.
This	was	a	very	 excit 	 ing 	 	time	,	developing	this	with	my	wonderful	Afghan	team	.
And	they	are	working	with	me	up	to	today	.
We	developed	a	 cultural 	 ly 	 - 	 sensitive 	 	 psycho 	 - 	 social 	 	 counsel 	 ing 	 	approach	.
So	,	from	2008	up	until	today	,	a	substantial	change	and	step	forward	has	been	taking	place	.
The	European	Union	delegation	in	Kabul	came	into	this	and	hired	me	to	work	inside	the	Ministry	of	Public	Health	,	to	lobby	this	approach	--	we	succeeded	.
We	 revis 	 ed 	 	the	mental	health	component	of	the	primary	health	care	services	by	 add 	 ing 	 	 psycho 	 - 	 social 	 	care	and	 psycho 	 - 	 social 	 	 counsel 	 ors 	 	to	the	system	.
This	means	,	 certain 	 ly 	 	,	to	 re 	 train 	 	all	health	staff	.
But	for	that	,	we	already	have	the	training	 manual 	 s 	 	,	which	are	approved	by	the	Ministry	and	 more 	 over 	 	,	this	approach	is	now	part	of	the	mental	health	strategy	in	Afghanistan	.
So	we	also	have	implemented	it	already	in	some	selected	 clinic 	 s 	 	in	three	provinces	,	and	you	are	the	first	to	see	the	results	.
We	wanted	to	know	if	what	is	being	done	is	effective	.
And	here	you	can	see	the	patients	all	had	symptoms	of	depression	,	 moderat 	 e 	 	and	severe	.
And	the	red	line	is	the	treatment	as	usual	--	medication	with	a	medical	doctor	.
And	all	the	symptoms	stayed	the	same	or	even	got	worse	.
And	the	green	line	is	treatment	with	 psycho 	 - 	 social 	 	 counsel 	 ing 	 	only	,	without	medication	.
And	you	can	see	the	symptoms	almost	 complete 	 ly 	 	go	away	,	and	the	 psycho 	 - 	 social 	 	stress	has	dropped	 s 	 ignificantly 	 	,	which	is	explicable	,	because	you	can	not	take	away	the	 psycho 	 - 	 social 	 	 s 	 tresses 	 	,	but	you	can	learn	how	to	cope	with	them	.
So	this	makes	us	very	happy	,	because	now	we	also	have	some	evidence	that	this	is	working	.
So	here	you	see	,	this	is	a	health	facility	in	Northern	Afghanistan	,	and	every	morning	it	looks	like	this	all	over	.
And	doctors	usually	have	three	to	six	minutes	for	the	patients	,	but	now	this	will	change	.
They	go	to	the	 clinic 	 s 	 	,	because	they	want	to	cure	their	immediate	symptoms	,	and	they	will	find	 some 	 body 	 	to	talk	to	and	discuss	these	issues	and	talk	about	what	is	 burden 	 ing 	 	them	and	find	solutions	,	develop	their	resources	,	learn	tools	to	solve	their	family	 conflict 	 s 	 	and	gain	some	confidence	in	the	future	.
And	I	would	like	to	share	one	short	vignette	.
``	If	we	were	to	have	met	some	years	ago	,	then	we	would	have	killed	each	other	.
And	now	you	are	 help 	 ing 	 	me	to	regain	some	confidence	in	the	future	.	''
And	another	 counsel 	 or 	 	said	to	me	after	the	training	,	``	You	know	,	I	never	knew	why	I	 surviv 	 ed 	 	the	 killing 	 s 	 	in	my	village	,	but	now	I	know	,	because	I	am	part	of	a	nucleus	of	a	new	peaceful	society	in	Afghanistan	.	''
So	I	believe	this	kept	me	running	.
And	this	is	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 emancipat 	 ory 	 	and	political	contribution	to	peace	and	reconciliation	.
And	also	--	I	think	--	without	 psycho 	 - 	 social 	 	therapy	,	and	without	 consider 	 ing 	 	this	in	all	humanitarian	projects	,	we	can	not	 build 	 - 	 up 	 	civil	societies	.
and	I	think	it	must	be	,	can	be	,	could	be	 replicat 	 ed 	 	elsewhere	.
I	thank	you	for	your	attention	.

Carl	 Honor 	 e 	 	 praise 	 s 	 	 slow 	 ness 	 
What	I	'd	like	to	start	off	with	is	an	observation	,	which	is	that	if	I	've	learned	anything	over	the	last	year	,	it	's	that	the	supreme	 iron 	 y 	 	of	publishing	a	book	about	 slow 	 ness 	 	is	that	you	have	to	go	around	 promot 	 ing 	 	it	 re 	 ally 	 	fast	.
I	seem	to	spend	most	of	my	time	these	days	zipping	from	city	to	city	,	studio	to	studio	,	interview	to	interview	,	serving	up	the	book	in	 re 	 ally 	 	tiny	 bite 	 - 	 size 	 	 chunk 	 s 	 	.
Because	everyone	these	days	 want 	 s 	 	to	know	how	to	slow	down	,	but	they	want	to	know	how	to	slow	down	 re 	 ally 	 	quickly	.	So	...
so	I	did	a	spot	on	CNN	the	other	day	where	I	actually	spent	more	time	in	makeup	than	I	did	talking	on	air	.
And	I	think	that	--	that	's	not	 re 	 ally 	 	 surpris 	 ing 	 	though	,	is	it	?
Because	that	's	kind	of	the	world	that	we	live	in	now	,	a	world	stuck	in	 fast 	 - 	 forward 	 	.
A	world	 obsess 	 ed 	 	with	speed	,	with	 do 	 ing 	 	everything	faster	,	with	 c 	 ramming 	 	more	and	more	into	less	and	less	time	.
Every	moment	of	the	day	 feel 	 s 	 	like	a	race	against	the	clock	.
To	borrow	a	phrase	from	Carrie	Fisher	,	which	is	in	my	bio	there	;	I	'll	just	 tos 	 s 	 	it	out	again	--	``	These	days	even	instant	 grat 	 ification 	 	takes	too	long	.	''
And	if	you	think	about	how	we	to	try	to	make	things	better	,	what	do	we	do	?
No	,	we	speed	them	up	,	do	n't	we	?	So	we	used	to	dial	;	now	we	speed	dial	.
We	used	to	read	;	now	we	speed	read	.	We	used	to	walk	;	now	we	speed	walk	.
And	of	course	,	we	used	to	date	and	now	we	speed	date	.
And	even	things	that	are	by	their	very	nature	slow	--	we	try	and	speed	them	up	too	.
So	I	was	in	New	York	 recent 	 ly 	 	,	and	I	walked	past	a	gym	that	had	an	advertisement	in	the	window	for	a	new	course	,	a	new	evening	course	.
And	it	was	for	,	you	 guess 	 ed 	 	it	,	speed	yoga	.
So	this	--	the	perfect	solution	for	 time 	 - 	 star 	 ved 	 	professionals	who	want	to	,	you	know	,	 salut 	 e 	 	the	sun	,	but	only	want	to	give	over	about	20	minutes	to	it	.
I	mean	,	these	are	sort	of	the	extreme	examples	,	and	they	're	 amus 	 ing 	 	and	good	to	laugh	at	.
But	there	's	a	very	serious	point	,	and	I	think	that	in	the	 head 	 long 	 	dash	of	daily	life	,	we	often	lose	sight	of	the	damage	that	this	 road 	 runner 	 	form	of	living	does	to	us	.
We	're	so	 mar 	 inated 	 	in	the	culture	of	speed	that	we	almost	fail	to	notice	the	toll	it	takes	on	every	aspect	of	our	lives	--	on	our	health	,	our	diet	,	our	work	,	our	relationships	,	the	environment	and	our	community	.
And	sometimes	it	takes	a	 wake 	 - 	 up 	 	call	,	does	n't	it	,	to	alert	us	to	the	fact	that	we	're	 hurry 	 ing 	 	through	our	lives	,	instead	of	actually	living	them	;	that	we	're	living	the	fast	life	,	instead	of	the	good	life	.
And	I	think	for	many	people	,	that	 wake 	 - 	 up 	 	call	takes	the	form	of	an	illness	.
You	know	,	a	 burn 	 out 	 	,	or	 eventual 	 ly 	 	the	body	says	,	``	I	ca	n't	take	it	 any 	 more 	 	,	''	and	throws	in	the	towel	.
Or	maybe	a	relationship	goes	up	in	smoke	because	we	have	n't	had	the	time	,	or	the	patience	,	or	the	 tranquil 	 ity 	 	,	to	be	with	the	other	person	,	to	listen	to	them	.
And	my	 wake 	 - 	 up 	 	call	came	when	I	started	reading	 bed 	 time 	 	stories	to	my	son	,	and	I	found	that	at	the	end	of	day	,	I	would	go	into	his	room	and	I	just	could	n't	slow	down	--	you	know	,	I	'd	be	speed	reading	``	The	Cat	In	The	Hat	.	''
I	'd	be	--	you	know	,	I	'd	be	 skip 	 ping 	 	lines	here	,	 paragraph 	 s 	 	there	,	sometimes	a	whole	page	,	and	of	course	,	my	little	boy	knew	the	book	inside	out	,	so	we	would	quarrel	.
And	what	should	have	been	the	most	 relax 	 ing 	 	,	the	most	 in 	 timate 	 	,	the	most	tender	moment	of	the	day	,	when	a	dad	sits	down	to	read	to	his	son	,	became	instead	this	kind	of	 gladiator 	 ial 	 	battle	of	 will 	 s 	 	,	a	clash	between	my	speed	And	this	went	on	for	some	time	,	until	I	caught	myself	scanning	a	newspaper	article	with	 time 	 saving 	 	tips	for	fast	people	.
And	one	of	them	made	reference	to	a	series	of	books	called	``	The	 One 	 - 	 Minute 	 	 Bed 	 time 	 	Story	.	''
And	I	 win 	 ce 	 	saying	those	words	now	,	but	my	first	reaction	at	the	time	was	very	different	.
My	first	reflex	was	to	say	,	``	Hallelujah	--	what	a	great	idea	!
This	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	I	'm	looking	for	to	speed	up	 bed 	 time 	 	even	more	.	''
But	 thank 	 fully 	 	,	a	light	bulb	went	on	over	my	head	,	and	my	next	reaction	was	very	different	,	and	I	took	a	step	back	,	and	I	thought	,	``	 Who 	 a 	 	--	you	know	,	has	it	 re 	 ally 	 	come	to	this	?
Am	I	 re 	 ally 	 	in	such	a	hurry	that	I	'm	prepared	to	fob	off	my	son	with	a	sound	byte	at	the	end	of	the	day	?	''
And	I	put	away	the	newspaper	--	and	I	was	getting	on	a	plane	--	and	I	sat	there	,	and	I	did	something	I	had	n't	done	for	a	long	time	--	which	is	I	did	nothing	.
I	just	thought	,	and	I	thought	long	and	hard	.
And	by	the	time	I	got	off	that	plane	,	I	'd	decided	I	wanted	to	do	something	about	it	.
I	wanted	to	 investigat 	 e 	 	this	whole	 road 	 runner 	 	culture	,	and	what	it	was	 do 	 ing 	 	to	me	and	to	everyone	else	.
And	I	had	two	questions	in	my	head	.
The	first	was	,	how	did	we	get	so	fast	?
And	the	second	is	,	is	it	possible	,	or	even	desirable	,	to	slow	down	?
Now	,	if	you	think	about	how	our	world	got	so	accelerated	,	the	usual	 suspect 	 s 	 	rear	their	heads	.
You	think	of	,	you	know	,	 urban 	 ization 	 	,	 consumer 	 ism 	 	,	the	workplace	,	technology	.
But	I	think	if	you	cut	through	those	forces	,	you	get	to	what	might	be	the	 deep 	 er 	 	driver	,	the	nub	of	the	question	,	which	is	how	we	think	about	time	itself	.
In	other	cultures	,	time	is	cyclical	.
It	's	seen	as	moving	in	great	,	 un 	 hurried 	 	circles	.
It	's	always	 renew 	 ing 	 	and	 refresh 	 ing 	 	itself	.
Whereas	in	the	West	,	time	is	linear	.
It	's	a	finite	resource	;	it	's	always	draining	away	.
You	either	use	it	,	or	lose	it	.
``	Time	is	money	,	''	as	Benjamin	Franklin	said	.
And	I	think	what	that	does	to	us	 psychological 	 ly 	 	is	it	 create 	 s 	 	an	equation	.
Time	is	scarce	,	so	what	do	we	do	?
Well	--	well	,	we	speed	up	,	do	n't	we	?
We	try	and	do	more	and	more	with	less	and	less	time	.
We	turn	every	moment	of	every	day	into	a	race	to	the	finish	line	--	a	finish	line	,	 incident 	 ally 	 	,	that	we	never	reach	,	but	a	finish	line	 none 	 theless 	 	.
And	I	guess	that	the	question	is	,	is	it	possible	to	break	free	from	that	 mind 	 set 	 	?
And	 thank 	 fully 	 	,	the	answer	is	yes	,	because	what	I	discovered	,	when	I	began	looking	around	,	that	there	is	a	global	backlash	against	this	culture	that	 tell 	 s 	 	us	that	faster	is	always	better	,	and	that	busier	is	best	.
Right	across	the	world	,	people	are	 do 	 ing 	 	the	 un 	 think 	 able 	 	:	they	're	 slow 	 ing 	 	down	,	and	finding	that	,	although	conventional	wisdom	 tell 	 s 	 	you	that	if	you	slow	down	,	you	're	road	kill	,	the	opposite	turns	out	to	be	true	:	that	by	 slow 	 ing 	 	down	at	the	right	 moment 	 s 	 	,	people	find	that	they	do	everything	better	.
They	eat	better	;	they	make	love	better	;	they	exercise	better	;	they	work	better	;	they	live	better	.
And	,	in	this	kind	of	 cauld 	 ron 	 	of	 moment 	 s 	 	and	places	and	acts	of	 de 	 celeration 	 	,	lie	what	a	lot	of	people	now	refer	to	as	the	``	International	Slow	Movement	.	''
Now	if	you	'll	permit	me	a	small	act	of	 hypo 	 crisy 	 	,	I	'll	just	give	you	a	very	quick	overview	of	what	's	going	on	inside	the	Slow	Movement	.	If	you	think	of	food	,	many	of	you	will	have	heard	of	the	Slow	Food	movement	.
Started	in	Italy	,	but	has	spread	across	the	world	,	and	now	has	100,000	members	in	50	countries	.
And	it	's	driven	by	a	very	simple	and	sensible	message	,	which	is	that	we	get	more	pleasure	and	more	health	from	our	food	when	we	 cultivat 	 e 	 	,	cook	and	consume	it	at	a	reasonable	pace	.
I	think	also	the	explosion	of	the	organic	farming	movement	,	and	the	renaissance	of	farmers	'	markets	,	are	other	 illustration 	 s 	 	of	the	fact	that	people	are	 desperat 	 e 	 	to	get	away	from	eating	and	cooking	and	 cultivat 	 ing 	 	their	food	on	an	industrial	timetable	.
They	want	to	get	back	to	 s 	 lower 	 	rhythms	.
And	out	of	the	Slow	Food	movement	has	grown	something	called	the	Slow	Cities	movement	,	which	has	started	in	Italy	,	but	has	spread	right	across	Europe	and	beyond	.
And	in	this	,	 town 	 s 	 	begin	to	 re 	 think 	 	how	they	organize	the	urban	landscape	,	so	that	people	are	encouraged	to	slow	down	and	smell	the	 rose 	 s 	 	and	connect	with	one	another	.
So	they	might	curb	traffic	,	or	put	in	a	park	bench	,	or	some	green	space	.
And	in	some	ways	,	these	changes	add	up	to	more	than	the	sum	of	their	parts	,	because	I	think	when	a	Slow	City	becomes	 official 	 ly 	 	a	Slow	City	,	it	's	kind	of	like	a	philosophical	declaration	.
It	's	saying	to	the	rest	of	world	,	and	to	the	people	in	that	town	,	that	we	believe	that	in	the	21st	century	,	 slow 	 ness 	 	has	a	role	to	play	.
In	medicine	,	I	think	a	lot	of	people	are	 deep 	 ly 	 	 disillusion 	 ed 	 	with	the	kind	of	 quick 	 - 	 fix 	 	 mental 	 ity 	 	you	find	in	conventional	medicine	.
And	 million 	 s 	 	of	them	around	the	world	are	turning	to	complementary	and	alternative	forms	of	medicine	,	which	tend	to	tap	into	sort	of	 s 	 lower 	 	,	 gent 	 ler 	 	,	more	 hol 	 istic 	 	forms	of	healing	.
Now	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	the	jury	is	out	on	many	of	these	complementary	therapies	,	and	I	 personal 	 ly 	 	doubt	that	the	coffee	 e 	 nema 	 	will	ever	,	you	know	,	gain	mainstream	approval	.
such	as	acupuncture	and	massage	,	and	even	just	relaxation	,	 clear 	 ly 	 	have	some	kind	of	benefit	.
And	 blue 	 - 	 chip 	 	medical	colleges	everywhere	are	starting	to	study	these	things	to	find	out	how	they	work	,	and	what	we	might	learn	from	them	.
Sex	.	There	's	an	awful	lot	of	fast	sex	around	,	is	n't	there	?
I	was	coming	to	--	well	--	no	pun	intended	there	.
I	was	making	my	way	,	let	's	say	,	 slow 	 ly 	 	to	Oxford	,	and	I	went	through	a	news	agent	,	and	I	saw	a	magazine	,	a	men	's	magazine	,	and	it	said	on	the	front	,	``	How	to	bring	your	partner	to	orgasm	in	30	seconds	.	''
So	,	you	know	,	even	sex	is	on	a	 stop 	 watch 	 	these	days	.
Now	,	you	know	,	I	like	a	 quick 	 ie 	 	as	much	as	the	next	person	,	but	I	think	that	there	's	an	awful	lot	to	be	gained	from	slow	sex	--	from	 slow 	 ing 	 	down	in	the	bedroom	.
You	know	,	you	tap	into	that	--	those	 deep 	 er 	 	,	sort	of	,	psychological	,	emotional	,	spiritual	currents	,	and	you	get	a	better	orgasm	with	the	 build 	 up 	 	.
You	can	get	more	bang	for	your	buck	,	let	's	say	.
I	mean	,	the	Pointer	Sisters	said	it	most	 eloquent 	 ly 	 	,	did	n't	they	,	when	they	sang	the	 praise 	 s 	 	of	``	a	lover	with	a	slow	hand	.	''
Now	,	we	all	 laugh 	 ed 	 	at	Sting	a	few	years	ago	when	he	went	Tantric	,	but	you	 fast 	 - 	 forward 	 	a	few	years	,	and	now	you	find	 couple 	 s 	 	of	all	ages	 flock 	 ing 	 	to	workshops	,	or	maybe	just	on	their	own	in	their	own	 bedroom 	 s 	 	,	finding	ways	to	put	on	the	brakes	and	have	better	sex	.
And	of	course	,	in	Italy	where	--	I	mean	,	 Italian 	 s 	 	always	seem	to	know	where	to	find	their	pleasure	--	they	've	launched	an	official	Slow	Sex	movement	.
The	workplace	.
Right	across	much	of	the	world	--	North	America	being	a	notable	exception	--	working	hours	have	been	coming	down	.
And	Europe	is	an	example	of	that	,	and	people	finding	that	their	quality	of	life	 improve 	 s 	 	as	they	're	working	less	,	and	also	that	their	hourly	productivity	goes	up	.
Now	,	 clear 	 ly 	 	there	are	problems	with	the	35-hour	 work 	 week 	 	in	France	--	too	much	,	too	soon	,	too	rigid	.
But	other	countries	in	Europe	,	 not 	 ably 	 	the	Nordic	countries	,	are	showing	that	it	's	possible	to	have	a	 kick 	 - 	 as 	 s 	 	economy	without	being	a	 work 	 aholic 	 	.
And	Norway	,	Sweden	,	Denmark	and	Finland	now	rank	among	the	top	six	most	competitive	nations	on	Earth	,	and	they	work	the	kind	of	hours	that	would	make	the	average	American	weep	with	envy	.
It	's	not	just	,	though	,	these	days	,	adults	who	 over 	 work 	 	,	though	,	is	it	?	It	's	children	,	too	.
I	'm	37	,	and	my	childhood	ended	in	the	 mid 	 - 	 ' 	 80 	 s 	 	,	and	I	look	at	kids	now	,	and	I	'm	just	 amaz 	 ed 	 	by	the	way	they	race	around	with	more	 home 	 work 	 	,	more	 tutor 	 ing 	 	,	more	 extra 	 curricular 	 s 	 	than	we	would	ever	have	conceived	of	a	generation	ago	.
And	some	of	the	most	 hear 	 trending 	 	 email 	 s 	 	that	I	get	on	my	website	are	actually	from	 adolescent 	 s 	 	 hover 	 ing 	 	on	the	edge	of	 burn 	 out 	 	,	pleading	with	me	to	write	to	their	parents	,	to	help	them	slow	down	,	to	help	them	get	off	this	 full 	 - 	 throttle 	 	 tread 	 mill 	 	.
But	 thank 	 fully 	 	,	there	is	a	backlash	there	in	 parent 	 ing 	 	as	well	,	and	you	're	finding	that	,	you	know	,	 town 	 s 	 	in	the	United	States	are	now	 band 	 ing 	 	together	and	banning	 extra 	 curricular 	 s 	 	on	a	particular	day	of	the	month	,	so	that	people	can	,	you	know	,	 de 	 compress 	 	and	have	some	family	time	,	and	slow	down	.
Homework	is	another	thing	.	There	are	 home 	 work 	 	 ban 	 s 	 	 spring 	 ing 	 	up	all	over	the	developed	world	in	schools	which	had	been	piling	on	the	 home 	 work 	 	for	years	,	and	now	they	're	 discover 	 ing 	 	that	less	can	be	more	.
So	there	was	a	case	up	in	Scotland	 recent 	 ly 	 	where	a	 fee 	 - 	 paying 	 	,	 high 	 - 	 achieving 	 	private	school	for	everyone	under	the	age	of	13	,	and	the	 high 	 - 	 achieving 	 	parents	 freak 	 ed 	 	out	and	said	,	``	What	are	you	--	you	know	,	our	kids	will	fall	''	--	the	headmaster	said	,	``	No	,	no	,	your	children	need	to	slow	down	at	the	end	of	the	day	.	''
And	just	this	last	month	,	the	exam	results	came	in	,	and	in	math	,	science	,	marks	went	up	20	percent	on	average	last	year	.
And	I	think	what	's	very	revealing	is	that	the	elite	universities	,	who	are	often	cited	as	the	reason	that	people	drive	their	kids	and	 hot 	 house 	 	them	so	much	,	are	starting	to	notice	the	caliber	of	students	coming	to	them	is	 fall 	 ing 	 	.	These	kids	have	wonderful	marks	;	they	have	 CV 	 s 	 	 jam 	 med 	 	with	 extra 	 curricular 	 s 	 	,	to	the	point	that	would	make	your	eyes	water	.
But	they	lack	spark	;	they	lack	the	ability	to	think	 creative 	 ly 	 	and	think	outside	--	they	do	n't	know	how	to	dream	.	And	so	what	these	Ivy	League	schools	,	and	Oxford	and	Cambridge	and	so	on	,	are	starting	to	send	a	message	to	parents	and	students	that	they	need	to	put	on	the	brakes	a	little	bit	.
And	in	Harvard	,	for	instance	,	they	send	out	a	letter	to	 under 	 graduates 	 	--	 fresh 	 men 	 	--	telling	them	that	they	'll	get	more	out	of	life	,	and	more	out	of	Harvard	,	if	they	put	on	the	brakes	,	if	they	do	less	,	but	give	time	to	things	,	the	time	that	things	need	,	to	enjoy	them	,	to	savor	them	.
And	even	if	they	sometimes	do	nothing	at	all	.
And	that	letter	is	called	--	very	revealing	,	I	think	--	``	Slow	Down	!	''	--	with	an	 exclamatio 	 n 	 	mark	on	the	end	.
So	 where 	 ver 	 	you	look	,	the	message	,	it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	me	,	is	the	same	:	that	less	is	very	often	more	,	that	 s 	 lower 	 	is	very	often	better	.	But	that	said	,	of	course	,	it	's	not	that	easy	to	slow	down	,	is	it	?
I	mean	,	you	heard	that	I	got	a	 speed 	 ing 	 	ticket	while	I	was	 research 	 ing 	 	my	book	on	the	benefits	of	 slow 	 ness 	 	,	and	that	's	true	,	but	that	's	not	all	of	it	.
I	was	actually	en	route	to	a	dinner	held	by	Slow	Food	at	the	time	.
And	if	that	's	not	 sham 	 ing 	 	enough	,	I	got	that	ticket	in	Italy	.
And	if	any	of	you	have	ever	driven	on	an	Italian	highway	,	you	'll	have	a	pretty	good	idea	of	how	fast	I	was	going	.
But	why	is	it	so	hard	to	slow	down	?
I	think	there	are	various	reasons	.
One	is	that	speed	is	fun	,	you	know	,	speed	is	sexy	.
It	's	all	that	 adrenal 	 ine 	 	rush	.	It	's	hard	to	give	it	up	.
I	think	there	's	a	kind	of	 metaphysic 	 al 	 	dimension	--	that	speed	becomes	a	way	of	 wall 	 ing 	 	 our 	 selves 	 	off	from	the	 bigg 	 er 	 	,	 deep 	 er 	 	questions	.
We	fill	our	head	with	 dis 	 traction 	 	,	with	 busy 	 ness 	 	,	so	that	we	do	n't	have	to	ask	,	am	I	well	?	Am	I	happy	?	Are	my	children	growing	up	right	?
Are	 politician 	 s 	 	making	good	decisions	on	my	 be 	 half 	 	?
Another	reason	--	although	I	think	,	 perhap 	 s 	 	,	the	most	powerful	reason	--	why	we	find	it	hard	to	slow	down	is	the	cultural	taboo	that	we	've	erected	against	 slow 	 ing 	 	down	.
``	Slow	''	is	a	dirty	word	in	our	culture	.
It	's	a	 by 	 word 	 	for	``	lazy	,	''	``	slacker	,	''	for	being	 some 	 body 	 	who	gives	up	.
You	know	,	``	he	's	a	bit	slow	.	''	It	's	actually	 synonym 	 ous 	 	with	being	stupid	.
I	guess	what	the	Slow	Movement	--	the	purpose	of	the	Slow	Movement	,	or	its	main	goal	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	is	to	tackle	that	taboo	,	and	to	say	that	yes	,	sometimes	slow	is	not	the	answer	,	that	there	is	such	a	thing	as	``	bad	slow	.	''
You	know	,	I	got	stuck	on	the	 M 	 25 	 	,	which	is	a	ring	road	around	London	,	 recent 	 ly 	 	,	and	spent	 three 	 - 	 and 	 - 	 a 	 - 	 half 	 	hours	there	.	And	I	can	tell	you	,	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	slow	.
But	the	new	idea	,	the	sort	of	 r 	 evolutionary 	 	idea	,	of	the	Slow	Movement	,	is	that	there	is	such	a	thing	as	``	good	slow	,	''	too	.
And	good	slow	is	,	you	know	,	taking	the	time	to	eat	a	meal	with	your	family	,	with	the	TV	 switch 	 ed 	 	off	.
Or	taking	the	time	to	look	at	a	problem	from	all	angles	in	the	office	to	make	the	best	decision	at	work	.
Or	even	simply	just	taking	the	time	to	slow	down	and	savor	your	life	.
Now	,	one	of	the	things	that	I	found	most	 uplift 	 ing 	 	about	all	of	this	stuff	that	's	happened	around	the	book	since	it	came	out	,	is	the	reaction	to	it	.
And	I	knew	that	when	my	book	on	 slow 	 ness 	 	came	out	,	it	would	be	 welcome 	 d 	 	by	the	New	Age	brigade	,	but	it	's	also	been	taken	up	,	with	great	gusto	,	by	the	corporate	world	--	you	know	,	business	press	,	but	also	big	companies	and	leadership	organizations	.
Because	people	at	the	top	of	the	chain	,	people	like	you	,	I	think	,	are	starting	to	 realiz 	 e 	 	that	there	's	too	much	speed	in	the	system	,	there	's	too	much	 busy 	 ness 	 	,	and	it	's	time	to	find	,	or	get	back	to	that	lost	art	of	shifting	gears	.
Another	 encourag 	 ing 	 	sign	,	I	think	,	is	that	it	's	not	just	in	the	developed	world	that	this	idea	's	been	taken	up	.	In	the	developing	world	,	in	countries	that	are	on	the	verge	of	making	that	leap	into	first	world	status	--	China	,	Brazil	,	Thailand	,	Poland	,	and	so	on	--	these	countries	have	 embrace 	 d 	 	the	idea	of	the	Slow	Movement	,	many	people	in	them	,	and	there	's	a	debate	going	on	in	their	media	,	on	the	streets	.
Because	I	think	they	're	looking	at	the	West	,	and	they	're	saying	,	``	Well	,	we	like	that	aspect	of	what	you	've	got	,	but	we	're	not	so	sure	about	that	.	''
So	all	of	that	said	,	is	it	,	I	guess	,	is	it	possible	?
That	's	 re 	 ally 	 	the	main	question	before	us	today	.	Is	it	possible	to	slow	down	?	And	I	'm	happy	to	be	able	to	say	to	you	that	the	answer	is	a	 resound 	 ing 	 	yes	.
And	I	present	myself	as	Exhibit	A	,	a	kind	of	 reform 	 ed 	 	and	 rehabilitat 	 ed 	 	 speed 	 - 	 aholic 	 	.
I	still	love	speed	.	You	know	,	I	live	in	London	,	and	I	work	as	a	journalist	,	and	I	enjoy	the	buzz	and	the	 busy 	 ness 	 	,	and	the	 adrenal 	 ine 	 	rush	that	comes	from	both	of	those	things	.
I	play	squash	and	ice	hockey	,	two	very	fast	sports	,	and	I	would	n't	give	them	up	for	the	world	.
But	I	've	also	,	over	the	last	year	or	so	,	got	in	touch	with	my	inner	tortoise	.
And	what	that	means	is	that	I	no	 long 	 er 	 	 over 	 load 	 	myself	 gratuit 	 ously 	 	.
My	default	mode	is	no	 long 	 er 	 	to	be	a	 rush 	 - 	 aholic 	 	.
I	no	 long 	 er 	 	hear	time	's	winged	chariot	drawing	near	,	or	at	least	not	as	much	as	I	did	before	.
I	can	actually	hear	it	now	,	because	I	see	my	time	is	 tick 	 ing 	 	off	.
And	the	 up 	 shot 	 	of	all	of	that	is	that	I	actually	feel	a	lot	 happi 	 er 	 	,	 health 	 ier 	 	,	more	productive	than	I	ever	have	.
I	feel	like	I	'm	living	my	life	rather	than	actually	just	racing	through	it	.
And	 perhap 	 s 	 	,	the	most	important	measure	of	the	success	of	this	is	that	I	feel	that	my	relationships	are	a	lot	 deep 	 er 	 	,	And	for	me	,	I	guess	,	the	 lit 	 mus 	 	test	for	whether	this	would	work	,	and	what	it	would	mean	,	was	always	going	to	be	 bed 	 time 	 	stories	,	because	that	's	sort	of	where	the	journey	began	.	And	there	too	the	news	is	rosy	.	You	know	,	at	the	end	of	the	day	,	I	go	into	my	son	's	room	.
I	do	n't	wear	a	watch	.	I	switch	off	my	computer	,	so	I	ca	n't	hear	the	email	 ping 	 ing 	 	into	the	basket	,	and	I	just	slow	down	to	his	pace	and	we	read	.
And	because	children	have	their	own	tempo	and	internal	clock	,	they	do	n't	do	quality	time	,	where	you	schedule	10	minutes	for	them	to	open	up	to	you	.
They	need	you	to	move	at	their	rhythm	.
I	find	that	10	minutes	into	a	story	,	you	know	,	my	son	will	 sudden 	 ly 	 	say	,	``	You	know	,	something	happened	in	the	playground	today	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 bother 	 ed 	 	me	.	''
And	we	'll	go	off	and	have	a	conversation	on	that	.
And	I	now	find	that	 bed 	 time 	 	stories	used	to	be	a	box	on	my	 to 	 - 	 do 	 	list	,	something	that	I	 dread 	 ed 	 	,	because	it	was	so	slow	and	I	had	to	get	through	it	quickly	.
It	's	become	my	reward	at	the	end	of	the	day	,	something	I	 re 	 ally 	 	cherish	.
And	I	have	a	kind	of	Hollywood	ending	to	my	talk	this	afternoon	,	which	goes	a	little	bit	like	this	:	a	few	months	ago	,	I	was	getting	ready	to	go	on	another	book	tour	,	and	I	had	my	bags	packed	.
I	was	 down 	 stairs 	 	by	the	front	door	,	and	I	was	waiting	for	a	taxi	,	and	my	son	came	down	the	stairs	and	he	'd	made	a	card	for	me	.	And	he	was	carrying	it	.
He	'd	gone	and	 staple 	 d 	 	two	cards	,	very	like	these	,	together	,	and	put	a	sticker	of	his	 favorit 	 e 	 	character	,	Tintin	,	on	the	front	.
And	he	said	to	me	,	or	he	handed	this	to	me	,	and	I	read	it	,	and	it	said	,	``	To	Daddy	,	love	Benjamin	.	''
And	I	thought	,	``	Aw	,	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	sweet	.
Is	that	a	good	luck	on	the	book	tour	card	?	''
And	he	said	,	``	No	,	no	,	no	,	Daddy	--	this	is	a	card	for	being	the	best	story	reader	in	the	world	.	''
And	I	thought	,	``	Yeah	,	you	know	,	this	 slow 	 ing 	 	down	thing	 re 	 ally 	 	does	work	.	''
Thank	you	very	much	.

Jose	Abreu	on	kids	transformed	by	music
Chris	Anderson	:	Let	's	now	see	the	 extraordinar 	 y 	 	speech	that	we	captured	a	couple	weeks	ago	.
Jose	Antonio	Abreu	:	My	dear	friends	,	ladies	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	,	I	am	 over 	 joyed 	 	today	at	being	awarded	the	TED	Prize	on	 be 	 half 	 	of	all	the	 distinguish 	 ed 	 	music	teachers	,	artists	and	 educator 	 s 	 	from	Venezuela	who	have	 self 	 lessly 	 	and	 loyal 	 ly 	 	 a 	 ccompanied 	 	me	for	35	years	in	founding	,	growing	and	developing	in	Venezuela	the	National	System	of	Youth	and	Children	's	 Orchestra 	 s 	 	and	 Choir 	 s 	 	.
Since	I	was	a	boy	,	in	my	early	childhood	,	I	always	wanted	to	be	a	musician	,	and	,	thank	God	,	I	made	it	.
From	my	teachers	,	my	family	and	my	community	,	I	had	all	the	necessary	support	to	become	a	musician	.
All	my	life	I	've	 dream 	 ed 	 	that	all	 Venezuela 	 n 	 	children	have	the	same	opportunity	that	I	had	.
From	that	desire	and	from	my	heart	stemmed	the	idea	to	make	music	a	deep	and	global	reality	for	my	country	.
From	the	very	first	rehearsal	,	I	saw	the	bright	future	 a 	 head 	 	.
Because	the	rehearsal	meant	a	great	challenge	to	me	.
I	had	received	a	donation	of	50	music	stands	to	be	used	by	100	boys	in	that	rehearsal	.
When	I	 arriv 	 ed 	 	at	the	rehearsal	,	only	11	kids	had	shown	up	,	and	I	said	to	myself	,	``	Do	I	close	the	program	or	multiply	these	kids	?	''
I	decided	to	face	the	challenge	,	and	on	that	same	night	,	I	promised	those	11	children	I	'd	turn	our	orchestra	into	one	of	the	leading	 orchestra 	 s 	 	in	the	world	.
Two	months	ago	,	I	remembered	that	promise	I	made	,	when	a	 distinguish 	 ed 	 	English	critic	published	an	article	in	the	London	Times	,	 as 	 king 	 	who	could	be	the	winner	of	the	Orchestra	World	Cup	.
He	mentioned	four	great	world	 orchestra 	 s 	 	,	and	the	fifth	one	was	Venezuela	's	Youth	Symphony	Orchestra	.
Today	we	can	say	that	art	in	Latin	America	is	no	 long 	 er 	 	a	 mono 	 poly 	 	of	elites	and	that	it	has	become	a	social	right	,	a	right	for	all	the	people	.
Child	:	There	is	no	difference	here	between	classes	,	nor	white	or	black	,	nor	if	you	have	money	or	not	.
Simply	,	if	you	are	talented	,	if	you	have	the	vocation	and	the	will	to	be	here	,	you	get	in	.	You	share	with	us	and	make	music	.
JA	:	During	the	recent	tour	by	the	Simon	Bolivar	Youth	Orchestra	of	Venezuela	of	U.S.	and	Europe	,	we	saw	how	our	music	moved	young	audiences	to	the	bottom	of	their	 soul 	 s 	 	,	how	children	and	 adolescent 	 s 	 	 rush 	 ed 	 	up	to	the	stage	to	receive	the	jackets	from	our	musicians	,	how	the	standing	 ov 	 ations 	 	,	sometimes	30	minutes	long	,	 see 	 med 	 	to	last	forever	,	and	how	the	public	,	after	the	concert	was	over	,	went	out	into	the	street	to	greet	our	young	people	in	triumph	.
This	meant	not	only	an	artistic	triumph	,	but	also	a	profound	emotional	 sympath 	 y 	 	between	the	public	of	the	most	advanced	nations	of	the	world	and	the	musical	youth	of	Latin	America	,	as	seen	in	Venezuela	,	giving	these	audiences	a	message	of	music	,	 vital 	 ity 	 	,	energy	,	enthusiasm	and	strength	.
In	its	essence	,	the	orchestra	and	the	choir	are	much	more	than	artistic	structures	.
They	are	examples	and	schools	of	social	life	,	because	to	 s 	 ing 	 	and	to	play	together	means	to	 int 	 imately 	 	coexist	toward	perfection	and	excellence	,	following	a	strict	discipline	of	organization	and	coordination	in	order	to	seek	the	harmonic	 inter 	 dependence 	 	of	voices	and	instruments	.
That	's	how	they	build	a	spirit	of	solidarity	and	fraternity	among	them	,	develop	their	 self 	 - 	 esteem 	 	and	foster	the	ethical	and	 aesthetic 	 al 	 	values	related	to	the	music	in	all	its	senses	.
This	is	why	music	is	 immense 	 ly 	 	important	in	the	awakening	of	sensibility	,	in	the	forging	of	values	and	in	the	training	of	 young 	 sters 	 	to	teach	other	kids	.
Child	:	After	all	this	time	here	,	music	is	life	.
Nothing	else	.
Music	is	life	.
JA	:	Each	teenager	and	child	in	El	Sistema	has	his	own	story	,	and	they	are	all	important	and	of	great	significance	to	me	.
Let	me	mention	the	case	of	 Edic 	 son 	 	Ruiz	.
He	is	a	boy	from	a	parish	in	Caracas	who	 passionate 	 ly 	 	attended	to	his	double	bass	lessons	at	the	San	Agustin	's	Junior	Orchestra	.
With	his	effort	,	and	the	support	of	his	mother	,	his	family	and	his	community	,	he	became	a	principal	member	in	the	double	bass	segment	of	the	Berlin	Philharmonic	Orchestra	.
We	have	another	 well 	 - 	 known 	 	case	--	 Gustav 	 o 	 	 Duda 	 mel 	 	.
He	started	as	a	boy	member	of	the	children	's	orchestra	in	his	 home 	 town 	 	,	 Bar 	 quis 	 i 	 meto 	 	.
There	,	he	grew	as	a	 violin 	 ist 	 	and	as	a	conductor	.
He	became	the	conductor	of	Venezuela	's	junior	 orchestra 	 s 	 	,	and	today	 conduct 	 s 	 	the	world	's	greatest	 orchestra 	 s 	 	.
He	is	the	musical	director	of	Los	Angeles	Philharmonic	,	and	is	still	the	overall	leader	of	Venezuela	's	junior	 orchestra 	 s 	 	.
He	was	the	conductor	of	the	Gothenburg	Symphony	Orchestra	,	and	he	's	an	 unbea 	 table 	 	example	for	young	musicians	in	Latin	America	and	the	world	.
The	structure	of	El	Sistema	is	based	on	a	new	and	flexible	 man 	 aging 	 	style	adapted	to	the	features	of	each	community	and	region	,	and	today	 attend 	 s 	 	to	300,000	children	of	the	lower	and	middle	class	all	over	Venezuela	.
It	's	a	program	of	social	rescue	and	deep	cultural	transformation	designed	for	the	whole	 Venezuela 	 n 	 	society	with	 absolute 	 ly 	 	no	 distinction 	 s 	 	 what 	 soever 	 	,	but	emphasizing	the	vulnerable	and	 endanger 	 ed 	 	social	groups	.
The	effect	of	El	Sistema	is	felt	in	three	fundamental	circles	:	in	the	 personal 	 / 	 social 	 	circle	,	in	the	family	circle	and	in	the	community	.
In	the	 personal 	 / 	 social 	 	circle	,	the	children	in	the	 orchestra 	 s 	 	and	 choir 	 s 	 	develop	their	intellectual	and	emotional	side	.
The	music	becomes	a	source	for	developing	the	dimensions	of	the	human	being	,	thus	 elevat 	 ing 	 	the	spirit	and	leading	man	to	a	full	development	of	his	personality	.
So	,	the	emotional	and	intellectual	profits	are	huge	--	the	acquisition	of	leadership	,	teaching	and	training	principles	,	the	sense	of	commitment	,	responsibility	,	 generos 	 ity 	 	and	dedication	to	others	,	and	the	individual	contribution	to	achieve	great	collective	goals	.
All	this	leads	to	the	development	of	 self 	 - 	 esteem 	 	and	confidence	.
Mother	Teresa	of	Calcutta	 insist 	 ed 	 	on	something	that	always	 impress 	 ed 	 	me	:	the	most	 miser 	 able 	 	and	tragic	thing	about	poverty	is	not	the	lack	of	bread	or	roof	,	but	the	feeling	of	being	 no 	 - 	 one 	 	--	the	feeling	of	not	being	 any 	 one 	 	,	the	lack	of	identification	,	the	lack	of	public	esteem	.
That	's	why	the	child	's	development	in	the	orchestra	and	the	choir	provides	him	with	a	noble	identity	and	makes	him	a	role	model	for	his	family	and	community	.
It	makes	him	a	better	student	at	school	because	it	 inspire 	 s 	 	in	him	a	sense	of	responsibility	,	 pers 	 everance 	 	and	punctuality	that	will	 great 	 ly 	 	help	him	at	school	.
Within	the	family	,	the	parents	'	support	is	 un 	 conditional 	 	.
The	child	becomes	a	role	model	for	both	his	parents	,	and	this	is	very	important	for	a	poor	child	.
Once	the	child	 discover 	 s 	 	he	is	important	to	his	family	,	he	begins	to	seek	new	ways	of	 improv 	 ing 	 	himself	and	 hope 	 s 	 	better	for	himself	and	his	community	.
Also	,	he	 hope 	 s 	 	for	social	and	economic	 improvement 	 s 	 	for	his	own	family	.
All	this	makes	up	a	constructive	and	 ascend 	 ing 	 	social	dynamic	.
The	large	majority	of	our	children	belong	,	as	I	already	mentioned	,	to	the	most	vulnerable	strata	of	the	 Venezuela 	 n 	 	population	.
That	 encourage 	 s 	 	them	to	embrace	new	dreams	,	new	goals	,	and	progress	in	the	various	opportunities	that	music	has	to	offer	.
Finally	,	in	the	circle	of	the	community	,	the	 orchestra 	 s 	 	prove	to	be	the	creative	spaces	of	culture	and	sources	of	exchange	and	new	 meaning 	 s 	 	.
The	 spontane 	 ity 	 	music	has	 exclude 	 s 	 	it	as	a	luxury	item	and	makes	it	a	 p 	 atrimony 	 	of	society	.
It	's	what	makes	a	child	play	a	violin	at	home	,	while	his	father	works	in	his	 carpent 	 ry 	 	.
It	's	what	makes	a	little	girl	play	the	clarinet	at	home	,	while	her	mother	does	the	 house 	 work 	 	.
The	idea	is	that	the	families	join	with	pride	and	joy	in	the	activities	of	the	 orchestra 	 s 	 	and	the	 choir 	 s 	 	that	their	children	belong	to	.
The	huge	spiritual	world	that	music	produces	in	itself	,	which	also	lies	within	itself	,	ends	up	 overcom 	 ing 	 	material	poverty	.
From	the	minute	a	child	's	taught	how	to	play	an	instrument	,	he	's	no	 long 	 er 	 	poor	.
He	becomes	a	child	in	progress	heading	for	a	professional	level	,	who	'll	later	become	a	full	citizen	.
 Need 	 less 	 	to	say	that	music	is	the	number	one	prevention	against	prostitution	,	violence	,	bad	 habit 	 s 	 	,	and	everything	 degrad 	 ing 	 	in	the	life	of	a	child	.
A	few	years	ago	,	historian	Arnold	Toynbee	said	that	the	world	was	 s 	 uffering 	 	a	huge	spiritual	crisis	.
Not	an	economic	or	social	crisis	,	but	a	spiritual	one	.
I	believe	that	to	confront	such	a	crisis	,	only	art	and	religion	can	give	proper	answers	to	humanity	,	to	 man 	 kind 	 	's	 deep 	 est 	 	 aspiration 	 s 	 	,	and	to	the	historic	 demand 	 s 	 	of	our	times	.
Education	--	the	synthesis	of	wisdom	and	knowledge	--	is	the	means	to	 s 	 trive 	 	for	a	more	perfect	,	more	aware	,	more	noble	and	more	just	society	.
With	passion	and	enthusiasm	we	pay	profound	 respect 	 s 	 	to	TED	for	its	 outstand 	 ing 	 	humanism	,	the	scope	of	its	principles	,	for	its	open	and	generous	promotion	of	young	values	.
We	hope	that	TED	can	 contribut 	 e 	 	in	a	full	and	fundamental	way	to	the	building	of	this	new	era	in	the	teaching	of	music	,	in	which	the	social	,	communal	,	spiritual	and	 vindicat 	 ory 	 	aims	of	the	child	and	the	adolescent	become	a	beacon	and	a	goal	for	a	vast	social	mission	.
No	 long 	 er 	 	putting	society	at	the	service	of	art	,	and	much	less	at	the	services	of	 monopol 	 ies 	 	of	the	elite	,	but	instead	art	at	the	service	of	society	,	at	the	service	of	the	 weak 	 est 	 	,	at	the	service	of	the	children	,	at	the	service	of	the	sick	,	at	the	service	of	the	vulnerable	,	and	at	the	service	of	all	those	who	cry	for	 v 	 indication 	 	through	the	spirit	of	their	human	condition	and	the	raising	up	of	their	dignity	.

Charles	Anderson	 discover 	 s 	 	 dragon 	 flies 	 	that	cross	 ocean 	 s 	 
Actually	,	I	come	from	Britain	,	but	I	've	been	living	in	Maldives	for	26	years	now	.
So	,	that	's	home	 re 	 ally 	 	.
The	Maldives	,	as	I	'm	sure	you	're	aware	,	are	a	chain	of	islands	off	the	southwest	coast	of	India	here	.
Capital	,	Malé	,	where	I	live	.
Actually	,	sitting	here	today	in	Mysore	,	we	're	closer	to	Malé	than	we	are	to	Delhi	,	for	example	.
If	you	're	in	IT	,	India	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	is	the	place	to	be	at	the	moment	.
But	if	you	're	a	marine	biologist	,	Maldives	is	not	such	a	bad	place	to	be	.
And	it	has	been	my	home	these	years	.
For	those	of	you	who	've	been	there	,	fantastic	coral	 reef 	 s 	 	,	fantastic	diving	,	fantastic	 snorkel 	 ing 	 	.
I	spend	as	much	of	my	time	as	possible	 investigat 	 ing 	 	the	marine	life	.
I	study	fish	,	also	the	 bigg 	 er 	 	things	,	whales	and	 dolphin 	 s 	 	.
This	is	a	blue	whale	.	We	have	blue	whales	in	the	waters	around	here	,	off	Maldives	,	around	the	waters	of	India	.	You	can	see	them	off	Kerala	.
And	,	in	fact	,	we	're	very	lucky	in	this	region	.
One	of	the	best	places	in	the	world	to	see	blue	whales	is	here	in	this	region	.
In	Sri	Lanka	,	if	you	go	down	to	the	south	coast	of	Sri	Lanka	,	during	the	northeast	monsoon	season	,	you	can	see	blue	whales	very	,	very	easily	.
It	's	probably	the	best	place	in	the	world	to	see	them	.
Now	,	when	I	talk	about	the	northeast	monsoon	season	,	I	'm	sure	many	of	you	here	know	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	I	mean	,	but	 perhap 	 s 	 	some	of	you	are	not	quite	so	sure	.
I	need	to	explain	a	little	bit	about	 monsoon 	 s 	 	.
Now	,	monsoon	,	the	root	of	the	word	``	monsoon	''	comes	from	the	word	``	season	.	''
So	,	it	's	just	a	season	.	And	there	are	two	seasons	in	most	of	South	Asia	.
And	in	the	summer	India	 heat 	 s 	 	up	,	 get 	 s 	 	very	hot	.
Hot	air	rises	,	and	air	is	drawn	in	off	the	sea	to	replace	it	.
And	the	way	it	works	is	,	it	comes	from	the	southwest	.
It	comes	off	the	ocean	here	and	is	drawn	up	towards	India	.
So	it	comes	from	the	southwest	.	It	's	a	southwest	monsoon	.
 Pick 	 s 	 	up	 moistur 	 e 	 	as	it	crosses	the	ocean	.
That	's	what	 bring 	 s 	 	the	monsoon	rain	.
And	then	in	the	winter	things	cool	down	.
High	pressure	 build 	 s 	 	over	India	.
And	the	whole	system	goes	into	reverse	.
So	,	the	wind	is	now	coming	from	the	northeast	out	of	India	,	across	the	Indian	Ocean	,	this	way	towards	Africa	.
Keep	that	in	mind	.
Now	,	I	'm	a	marine	biologist	,	but	I	'm	actually	a	bit	of	an	old	fashioned	naturalist	,	I	suppose	.
I	'm	interested	in	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	things	,	almost	everything	that	moves	,	including	 dragon 	 flies 	 	.	And	I	'm	actually	going	to	talk	,	this	afternoon	,	about	 dragon 	 flies 	 	.
This	is	a	very	beautiful	species	,	it	's	called	the	Oriental	Scarlet	.
And	one	thing	you	need	to	know	about	 dragon 	 flies 	 	,	one	important	thing	,	is	that	they	lay	their	eggs	in	fresh	water	.
They	need	fresh	water	to	breed	.
They	lay	the	eggs	into	fresh	water	.
Little	larvae	hatch	out	in	fresh	water	.
They	feed	on	other	little	things	.	They	feed	on	mosquito	larvae	.
So	,	they	're	very	important	.
They	control	mosquito	larvae	,	among	other	things	.
And	they	grow	and	grow	by	stages	.	And	they	climb	out	of	the	water	,	burst	out	,	as	the	adult	which	we	see	.
And	typically	,	there	is	a	lot	of	variation	,	but	if	you	have	a	dragonfly	with	,	say	,	a	one	year	life	cycle	,	which	is	quite	typical	,	the	larva	,	living	in	the	fresh	water	,	lives	for	10	or	11	months	.
And	then	the	adult	,	which	comes	after	,	lives	for	one	or	two	months	.
So	it	's	 essential 	 ly 	 	a	 fresh 	 water 	 	animal	.
It	 re 	 ally 	 	does	need	fresh	water	.
Now	,	the	particular	species	of	dragonfly	I	want	to	talk	about	is	this	one	,	because	most	 dragon 	 flies 	 	,	like	the	one	we	've	just	seen	,	when	the	adult	is	there	for	its	brief	one	or	two	months	of	life	,	it	does	n't	go	very	far	.	It	ca	n't	travel	very	far	.
A	few	kilometers	,	maybe	,	is	quite	typical	.
They	are	very	good	 flier 	 s 	 	,	but	they	do	n't	go	too	far	.
But	this	guy	is	an	exception	.
And	this	is	called	the	Globe	Skimmer	,	or	 Wander 	 ing 	 	Glider	.
And	,	as	the	name	might	suggest	,	it	is	found	pretty	much	around	the	world	.
It	lives	throughout	the	 tropic 	 s 	 	,	the	Americas	,	Africa	,	Asia	,	Australia	,	into	the	Pacific	.
And	it	 wander 	 s 	 	far	and	wide	.	We	know	that	much	about	it	.
But	it	 re 	 ally 	 	has	n't	been	studied	very	much	.
It	's	a	rather	mediocre	looking	dragonfly	.
If	you	're	going	to	study	 dragon 	 flies 	 	,	you	want	to	study	those	 re 	 ally 	 	bright	beautiful	ones	,	like	that	red	one	.	Or	the	 re 	 ally 	 	rare	ones	,	the	endemic	 endanger 	 ed 	 	ones	.
This	is	,	it	 seem 	 s 	 	a	bit	dull	you	know	.
It	's	sort	of	 dull 	 - 	 colored 	 	.	And	it	's	 fair 	 ly 	 	common	.
And	it	occurs	everywhere	--	you	know	,	why	bother	?
But	if	you	take	that	attitude	,	you	're	actually	missing	something	rather	special	.
Because	this	dragonfly	has	a	rather	amazing	story	to	tell	.
And	I	feel	very	privileged	to	have	 s 	 tumble 	 d 	 	across	it	living	in	the	Maldives	.
When	I	first	went	to	the	Maldives	,	dead	keen	on	diving	,	spent	as	much	of	my	time	as	I	could	in	and	under	the	water	.
Did	n't	notice	any	 dragon 	 flies 	 	;	maybe	they	were	there	,	maybe	they	were	n't	.
Did	n't	notice	them	.
But	after	some	time	,	after	some	months	,	one	day	as	I	was	going	out	and	about	,	 sudden 	 ly 	 	I	noticed	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 dragon 	 flies 	 	,	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 dragon 	 flies 	 	.
Something	like	this	,	these	are	all	this	species	Globe	Skimmer	.
I	did	n't	know	at	the	time	,	but	I	know	now	,	they	're	Globe	 Skimmer 	 s 	 	,	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	them	.
And	they	were	there	for	some	time	.	And	then	they	were	gone	.
And	I	did	n't	think	anything	more	of	it	until	the	following	year	,	when	it	happened	again	,	and	then	the	year	after	that	,	and	then	the	year	after	that	.
And	I	was	a	bit	slow	,	I	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	take	too	much	notice	.
But	I	asked	some	 Maldivia 	 n 	 	friends	and	 colleague 	 s 	 	,	and	yes	they	come	every	year	.
And	I	asked	people	about	them	and	yes	,	they	knew	,	but	they	did	n't	know	anything	,	where	they	came	from	,	or	anything	.
And	again	I	did	n't	think	too	much	of	it	.
But	 slow 	 ly 	 	it	began	to	dawn	on	me	that	something	rather	special	was	happening	.
Because	 dragon 	 flies 	 	need	fresh	water	to	breed	.
And	the	Maldives	,	and	I	'm	sure	some	of	you	have	been	there	--	so	here	is	home	.
So	,	Maldives	,	beautiful	place	.
It	's	built	 entire 	 ly 	 	of	coral	 reef 	 s 	 	.
And	on	top	of	the	coral	 reef 	 s 	 	are	sand	banks	.
Average	height	,	about	that	much	above	sea	level	.
So	,	global	warming	,	sea	level	rise	,	it	's	a	real	serious	issue	.
But	I	'm	not	going	to	talk	about	that	.
Another	important	point	of	these	sand	banks	is	that	when	it	 rain 	 s 	 	,	the	 rain 	 water 	 	 s 	 oaks 	 	down	into	the	soil	.	So	,	it	's	gone	.
So	,	it	 stay 	 s 	 	under	the	soil	.
The	trees	can	put	their	roots	into	it	.
Humans	can	dig	holes	and	make	a	well	.
But	 dragon 	 flies 	 	--	a	bit	 trick 	 y 	 	.
There	is	no	surface	fresh	water	.
There	are	no	ponds	,	streams	,	rivers	,	lakes	,	nothing	like	that	.
So	,	why	is	it	that	every	year	 million 	 s 	 	of	 dragon 	 flies 	 	,	 million 	 s 	 	,	 million 	 s 	 	of	 dragon 	 flies 	 	turn	up	?
I	got	a	little	bit	curious	.	In	fact	I	'll	stop	here	,	because	I	want	to	ask	,	and	there	is	a	lot	of	people	who	,	from	India	of	course	,	people	who	grew	up	spending	your	childhood	here	.
Those	of	you	who	are	Indian	or	spent	your	childhood	here	,	let	me	have	a	show	of	hands	,	who	of	you	--	not	yet	,	not	yet	!
You	're	too	keen	.	You	're	too	keen	.	No	.	Hang	on	.	Hang	on	.
Wait	for	the	go	.	I	'll	say	go	.
Those	of	you	who	grew	up	in	India	,	do	you	remember	in	your	childhood	,	 dragon 	 flies 	 	,	swarms	of	 dragon 	 flies 	 	?	Maybe	at	school	,	maybe	 ty 	 ing 	 	little	bits	of	string	onto	them	?
Maybe	pulling	bits	off	?	I	'm	not	 as 	 king 	 	about	that	.
You	've	only	got	to	say	,	do	you	remember	seeing	lots	of	 dragon 	 flies 	 	.
Any	hands	?	Any	hands	?	Yes	.	Thank	you	.	Thank	you	.
It	's	a	widespread	phenomenon	throughout	South	Asia	,	including	the	Maldives	.
And	I	got	a	bit	curious	about	it	.
In	the	Maldives	--	now	,	in	India	there	is	plenty	of	water	,	so	,	 dragon 	 flies 	 	,	yeah	,	of	course	.	Why	not	?
But	in	Maldives	,	no	fresh	water	.	So	,	what	on	Earth	is	going	on	?
And	the	first	thing	I	did	was	started	recording	when	they	turned	up	in	the	Maldives	.
And	there	is	the	answer	,	21st	of	October	.
Not	every	year	,	that	's	the	average	date	.
So	,	I	've	been	writing	it	down	for	15	years	now	.
You	'd	think	they	're	coming	from	India	.	It	's	the	 closes 	 t 	 	place	.
But	in	October	,	remember	,	we	're	still	in	southwest	monsoon	,	Maldives	is	still	in	the	southwest	monsoon	.
But	wind	is	,	 in 	 vari 	 ably 	 	,	every	time	,	is	from	the	west	.
It	's	going	towards	India	,	not	from	India	.
So	,	are	these	things	,	how	are	these	things	getting	here	?
Are	they	coming	from	India	against	the	wind	?
 See 	 med 	 	a	bit	unlikely	.
So	,	next	thing	I	did	is	I	got	on	the	phone	.
Maldives	is	a	long	archipelago	.
It	 stretch 	 es 	 	about	500	miles	,	of	course	it	's	India	here	.
I	got	on	the	phone	and	 email 	 ed 	 	to	friends	and	 colleague 	 s 	 	.
When	do	you	see	the	 dragon 	 flies 	 	appear	?
And	pretty	soon	,	a	picture	started	emerging	.
In	Bangalore	,	a	colleague	there	sent	me	information	for	three	years	,	average	,	24th	of	September	,	so	late	September	.
Down	in	Trivandrum	,	a	bit	later	.
Far	north	of	Maldives	,	a	bit	later	.
Then	Malé	,	then	further	south	.
And	then	the	 southern 	 most 	 	Maldives	.
It	's	pretty	obvious	,	they	're	coming	from	India	.
But	they	are	coming	400	miles	across	the	ocean	,	against	the	wind	.
How	on	Earth	are	they	 do 	 ing 	 	that	?
I	did	n't	know	.
The	next	thing	I	did	was	I	started	counting	 dragon 	 flies 	 	.
I	wanted	to	know	about	their	 season 	 ality 	 	,	what	time	of	year	,	this	is	when	they	first	arrive	,	but	how	long	are	they	around	for	?	Does	that	give	any	clues	?
So	,	I	started	a	very	rigorous	scientific	process	.
I	had	a	rigorous	scientific	transect	.
I	got	on	my	bicycle	,	and	I	 cycle 	 d 	 	around	the	island	of	Malé	.
It	's	about	five	kilometers	around	,	counting	the	 dragon 	 flies 	 	as	I	go	,	 try 	 ing 	 	not	to	bump	into	people	as	I	'm	looking	in	the	trees	.
And	they	're	here	for	a	very	short	time	,	October	,	November	,	December	.	That	's	it	.
And	then	they	tail	off	,	there	's	a	few	,	but	that	's	it	.
October	,	November	,	December	.	That	is	not	the	northeast	monsoon	season	.
That	's	not	the	southwest	season	.
That	's	the	 inter 	 - 	 monsoon 	 	,	the	time	when	the	monsoon	changes	.
Now	,	what	I	said	was	,	you	get	the	southwest	monsoon	going	one	way	,	and	then	it	changes	and	you	get	the	northeast	monsoon	going	the	other	way	.
And	that	sort	of	gives	the	impression	you	've	got	one	air	mass	going	up	and	down	,	up	and	down	.	It	does	n't	work	like	that	.
What	 happen 	 s 	 	,	actually	,	is	there	is	two	air	masses	.
And	there	is	a	front	between	them	,	and	the	front	moves	.
So	,	if	you	've	got	India	here	,	when	the	front	is	up	above	India	you	're	into	the	southwest	monsoon	.
Then	the	front	moves	into	the	northeast	monsoon	.
And	that	front	in	the	middle	is	not	vertical	,	it	's	at	an	angle	.
So	,	as	it	comes	over	towards	Malé	I	'm	standing	in	Malé	 u 	 nderneath 	 	the	front	.
I	can	be	in	the	southwest	monsoon	.
But	the	wind	above	is	from	the	northeast	monsoon	.
So	,	the	 dragon 	 flies 	 	are	actually	coming	from	India	on	the	northeast	monsoon	,	but	at	an	altitude	at	1,000	to	2,000	meters	up	in	the	air	.	Incredible	.
These	little	 insect 	 s 	 	,	it	's	the	same	ones	we	see	out	here	[	in	India	]	,	two	inches	long	,	five	 centimeter 	 s 	 	long	,	flying	in	their	 million 	 s 	 	,	400	miles	across	the	ocean	,	at	2,000	meters	up	.	Quite	 incredibl 	 e 	 	.
So	,	I	was	quite	 please 	 d 	 	with	myself	.	I	thought	wow	,	I	've	tracked	this	one	,	I	know	how	they	come	here	.	Then	I	 scratch 	 ed 	 	my	head	a	bit	,	and	that	's	okay	,	I	know	how	they	come	here	,	but	why	do	they	come	here	?
What	are	 million 	 s 	 	of	 dragon 	 flies 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	,	flying	out	over	the	ocean	every	year	to	their	apparent	doom	?
It	does	n't	make	sense	.	There	is	nothing	for	them	in	Maldives	.
What	on	Earth	are	they	 do 	 ing 	 	?
Well	,	to	cut	a	long	story	short	,	they	're	actually	flying	right	across	the	ocean	.
They	're	making	it	all	the	way	across	to	East	Africa	.
I	know	that	because	I	have	friends	who	work	on	fisheries	'	research	vessels	who	have	sent	to	me	reports	from	boats	out	in	the	ocean	.
I	know	because	we	have	reports	from	 Seychell 	 es 	 	,	which	fit	in	as	well	,	down	here	.
And	I	know	because	when	you	look	at	the	 rain 	 fall 	 	,	these	particular	 insect 	 s 	 	,	these	Globe	 Skimmer 	 s 	 	breed	in	temporary	rain	water	pools	.
Okay	,	they	lay	their	eggs	where	the	seasonal	 rain 	 s 	 	are	,	the	monsoon	 rain 	 s 	 	.
The	larvae	have	to	develop	very	quickly	.
They	only	take	six	weeks	.	Instead	of	11	months	,	they	're	six	weeks	.
They	're	up	,	and	they	're	off	.
Now	,	here	we	have	,	in	case	you	ca	n't	read	at	the	back	,	the	top	is	 rain 	 fall 	 	for	India	.
And	we	're	starting	in	June	.	So	this	is	the	monsoon	rain	.
By	September	,	October	,	it	's	drying	out	.
Nothing	for	these	 dragon 	 flies 	 	.	There	is	no	more	seasonal	rain	.
They	've	got	to	go	hunting	for	seasonal	rain	.
And	they	fly	south	.	As	the	monsoon	 withdraw 	 s 	 	to	the	south	they	come	down	through	Karnataka	,	into	Kerala	.
And	then	they	run	out	of	land	.
But	they	are	 incredibl 	 y 	 	good	 flier 	 s 	 	.	This	particular	species	,	it	can	fly	for	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	kilometers	.
And	it	just	keeps	going	.	And	the	wind	,	the	northeast	wind	 s 	 woosh 	 es 	 	it	around	and	carries	it	off	across	the	ocean	to	Africa	,	where	it	's	 rain 	 ing 	 	.
And	they	are	breeding	in	the	 rain 	 s 	 	of	Africa	.
Now	,	this	is	southeast	Africa	.	It	makes	it	look	like	there	are	sort	of	two	breeding	 period 	 s 	 	here	.	It	's	 s 	 lightly 	 	more	complicated	than	that	.
What	's	happening	is	they	are	breeding	in	the	monsoon	 rain 	 s 	 	here	.
And	the	 dragon 	 flies 	 	you	can	see	today	outside	here	,	on	the	campus	,	are	the	young	of	this	generation	.
They	hatched	out	in	India	.
They	're	looking	for	 s 	 omewhere 	 	to	breed	.	If	it	 rain 	 s 	 	here	they	'll	breed	.
But	most	of	them	are	going	to	carry	on	.	And	next	stop	,	 perhap 	 s 	 	only	four	or	five	days	away	is	going	to	be	East	Africa	.
The	wind	will	 s 	 woosh 	 	them	out	across	here	.
If	they	pass	the	Maldives	they	might	go	and	have	a	look	,	nothing	there	,	they	'll	carry	on	.
Here	,	here	,	Kenya	,	East	Africa	,	they	've	actually	just	come	out	of	a	long	drought	.
Just	last	week	the	 rain 	 s 	 	broke	.	The	short	 rain 	 s 	 	broke	and	it	's	 rain 	 ing 	 	there	now	.
And	the	 dragon 	 flies 	 	are	there	.	I	have	reports	from	my	various	 contact 	 s 	 	.
The	 dragon 	 flies 	 	are	here	now	.	They	're	breeding	there	.
When	those	guys	,	they	'll	lay	their	eggs	now	.
They	'll	hatch	out	in	six	weeks	.	By	that	time	the	seasonal	 rain 	 s 	 	have	moved	on	.	It	's	not	there	,	it	's	down	here	.
They	'll	fly	down	here	.	And	the	clever	thing	is	the	wind	is	always	 con 	 verging 	 	to	where	the	rain	is	.
The	rain	occurs	,	these	are	summer	 rain 	 s 	 	.
This	is	a	summer	monsoon	.
The	sun	is	 over 	 head 	 	there	.	Summer	 rain 	 s 	 	in	southern	Africa	.
The	sun	is	 over 	 head 	 	,	maximum	heating	,	maximum	evaporation	,	maximum	clouds	,	maximum	 rain 	 fall 	 	,	maximum	opportunities	for	reproduction	.
Not	only	that	,	because	you	have	this	convection	,	you	have	this	rising	of	the	air	where	it	's	hot	,	air	is	drawn	in	.
There	's	a	convergence	.	So	,	 where 	 ver 	 	the	rain	is	 fall 	 ing 	 	,	the	air	is	drawn	towards	it	to	replace	the	air	that	's	rising	.
So	,	the	little	fellow	that	 hatch 	 es 	 	out	here	,	he	 get 	 s 	 	up	into	the	air	,	he	is	 automatic 	 ally 	 	carried	to	where	the	rain	is	 fall 	 ing 	 	.
Lay	their	eggs	,	next	generation	,	they	come	up	,	 automatic 	 ally 	 	carried	to	where	the	rain	is	 fall 	 ing 	 	.
It	's	now	back	there	.	They	come	out	,	it	's	time	to	come	back	.
So	,	in	four	 generation 	 s 	 	,	one	,	two	,	three	,	four	and	then	back	.
A	complete	circuit	of	the	Indian	Ocean	.
This	is	a	circuit	of	about	16,000	kilometers	.
16,000	kilometers	,	four	 generation 	 s 	 	,	mind	you	,	for	a	two	inch	long	insect	.	It	's	quite	 incredibl 	 e 	 	.
Those	of	you	from	North	America	will	be	familiar	with	the	Monarch	butterfly	.
Which	,	up	until	now	has	had	the	 long 	 est 	 	known	insect	migration	.
It	's	only	half	the	length	of	this	one	.
And	this	crossing	here	,	of	the	ocean	,	is	the	only	 tru 	 ly 	 	regular	 trans 	 oceanic 	 	crossing	of	any	insect	.
A	quite	 incredibl 	 e 	 	feat	.
And	I	only	 s 	 tumble 	 d 	 	on	this	because	I	was	living	in	Malé	,	in	Maldives	for	long	enough	for	it	to	 per 	 colate 	 	into	my	brain	that	something	rather	special	was	going	on	.
But	 dragon 	 flies 	 	are	not	the	only	creatures	that	make	the	crossing	.
There	is	more	to	the	story	.
I	'm	also	interested	in	birds	.	And	I	'm	familiar	with	this	fellow	.	This	is	a	rather	special	bird	.
It	's	a	falcon	.	It	's	called	the	eastern	 red 	 - 	 footed 	 	falcon	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	.
But	it	's	also	called	the	Amur	Falcon	.
And	it	's	called	the	Amur	Falcon	because	it	breeds	in	 Amur 	 land 	 	.
Which	is	an	area	along	the	Amur	River	,	which	is	up	here	.
It	's	the	border	,	much	of	it	is	the	border	between	China	and	Russia	,	up	here	in	the	far	east	.
So	,	Siberia	,	 Manchur 	 ia 	 	.
And	that	's	where	it	breeds	.
And	if	you	're	a	falcon	it	's	quite	a	nice	place	to	be	in	the	summer	.
But	it	's	a	pretty	 miser 	 able 	 	place	to	be	in	the	winter	.
It	's	,	well	,	you	can	imagine	.
So	,	as	any	sensible	bird	would	do	,	he	moves	south	.	They	move	south	.	The	whole	population	moves	south	.
But	then	the	being	sensible	stopped	.
So	,	now	they	do	n't	stop	here	,	or	even	down	here	.
No	,	they	turn	across	here	.
They	have	a	little	refueling	stop	in	 northeaster 	 n 	 	India	.
They	come	to	the	latitude	of	about	Mumbai	or	Goa	.
And	then	they	strike	out	across	the	ocean	,	down	to	Kenya	.
And	down	here	,	and	they	winter	down	here	[	in	southern	Africa	]	.
Incredible	.	This	is	the	most	 extraordinar 	 y 	 	migration	of	any	bird	of	prey	.	A	quite	 incredibl 	 e 	 	migration	.
And	they	are	not	the	only	one	that	makes	the	crossing	.
They	have	the	most	 incredibl 	 e 	 	journey	,	but	several	make	the	crossing	from	India	to	Africa	.	Includes	this	one	,	the	hobby	.
This	fellow	is	a	very	nice	bird	,	this	is	the	Pied	cuckoo	.
Those	of	you	from	northern	India	will	be	familiar	with	this	.
It	comes	with	the	 monsoon 	 s 	 	.
This	time	of	year	they	cross	back	to	Africa	.
And	this	guy	,	the	roller	,	a	rather	beautiful	bird	.
It	's	known	as	the	 Eurasia 	 n 	 	Roller	.	In	India	it	occurs	in	the	northwest	,	so	it	's	known	as	the	Kashmir	Roller	.
And	these	birds	,	what	I	've	done	is	I	've	 compli 	 ed 	 	all	the	records	,	all	the	available	records	of	these	birds	,	put	them	together	,	and	found	out	they	migrate	at	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	time	as	the	 dragon 	 flies 	 	.
They	make	use	of	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	winds	.
They	travel	at	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	time	with	the	same	winds	to	make	the	crossing	.	I	know	they	travel	at	the	same	altitude	.
It	's	known	about	the	Amur	Falcon	.	This	guy	,	 unfortunat 	 ely 	 	,	one	of	these	met	an	 unfortunat 	 e 	 	end	.
He	was	flying	off	the	coast	of	Goa	,	21	years	ago	,	1988	.	October	,	1988	.
An	Indian	Navy	jet	was	flying	off	Goa	,	bang	!	In	the	middle	of	the	night	.	Fortunately	,	a	two	engine	jet	got	back	to	base	,	and	they	 pull 	 ed 	 	the	remains	of	one	of	these	[	 Eurasia 	 n 	 	 Roller 	 s 	 	]	out	.
Flying	at	night	over	the	Indian	Ocean	2,424	meters	.
Same	height	as	the	 dragon 	 flies 	 	go	.
So	,	they	are	 us 	 ing 	 	the	same	winds	.
And	the	other	thing	,	the	other	important	factor	for	all	these	birds	,	all	medium	 s 	 ized 	 	fellows	,	and	this	includes	the	next	slide	as	well	,	which	is	a	 bee 	 - 	 eater 	 	.
 Bee 	 - 	 eaters 	 	eat	bees	.	This	one	has	a	nice	blue	cheek	.
It	's	a	 Blue 	 - 	 cheek 	 ed 	 	 Bee 	 - 	 eater 	 	.
And	every	one	of	these	birds	that	makes	the	crossing	from	India	to	East	Africa	eats	 insect 	 s 	 	,	large	 insect 	 s 	 	,	the	size	of	 dragon 	 flies 	 	.	Thank	you	very	much	.

Asher	Hasan	's	message	of	peace	from	Pakistan
 Namast 	 e 	 	.	Salaam	.
Shalom	.	Sat	Sri	Akal	.
Greetings	to	all	of	you	from	Pakistan	.
It	is	often	said	that	we	fear	that	which	we	do	not	know	.
And	Pakistan	,	in	this	particular	vein	,	is	very	similar	.
Because	it	has	provoked	,	and	does	 provok 	 e 	 	,	a	visceral	anxiety	in	the	bellies	of	many	a	Western	soul	,	especially	when	viewed	through	the	 mono 	 chromatic 	 	lens	of	turbulence	and	turmoil	.
But	there	are	many	other	dimensions	to	Pakistan	.
And	what	follows	is	a	stream	of	images	,	a	series	of	images	captured	by	some	of	Pakistan	's	most	dynamic	and	young	 photographer 	 s 	 	,	that	aims	to	give	you	an	alternative	 glimps 	 e 	 	,	a	look	inside	the	hearts	and	minds	of	some	ordinary	Pakistani	citizens	.
Here	are	some	of	the	stories	they	wanted	us	to	share	with	you	.
My	name	is	Abdul	Khan	.	I	come	from	Peshawar	.
I	hope	that	you	will	be	able	to	see	not	just	my	 Taliban 	 - 	 like 	 	beard	,	but	also	the	 rich 	 ness 	 	and	color	of	my	 perception 	 s 	 	,	 aspiration 	 s 	 	and	dreams	,	as	rich	and	 color 	 ful 	 	as	the	 satchel 	 s 	 	that	I	sell	.
My	name	is	Meher	and	this	is	my	friend	Irim	.
I	hope	to	become	a	vet	when	I	grow	up	so	that	I	can	take	care	of	stray	cats	and	dogs	who	wander	around	the	streets	of	the	village	that	I	live	near	Gilgit	,	northern	Pakistan	.
My	name	is	Kailash	.	And	I	like	to	enrich	lives	through	 techni 	 colored 	 	glass	.
Madame	,	would	you	like	some	of	those	orange	 bang 	 les 	 	with	the	pink	polka	dots	?
My	name	is	Zamin	.
And	I	'm	an	IDP	,	an	 internal 	 ly 	 	 displace 	 d 	 	person	,	from	Swat	.
Do	you	see	me	on	the	other	side	of	this	fence	?
Do	I	matter	,	or	 re 	 ally 	 	exist	for	you	?
My	name	is	Iman	.	I	am	a	fashion	model	,	an	 up 	 - 	 and 	 - 	 coming 	 	model	from	Lahore	.
Do	you	see	me	simply	 s 	 mother 	 ed 	 	in	cloth	?
Or	can	you	move	beyond	my	veil	and	see	me	for	who	I	 tru 	 ly 	 	am	inside	?
My	name	is	Ahmed	.	I	am	an	Afghan	refugee	from	the	Khyber	agency	.
I	have	come	from	a	place	of	intense	darkness	.
And	that	is	why	I	want	to	 illuminat 	 e 	 	the	world	.
My	name	is	 Papu 	 say 	 	.
My	heart	and	drum	beat	as	one	.
If	religion	is	the	opium	of	the	masses	,	then	for	me	,	music	is	my	one	and	only	 ganj 	 a 	 	.
A	rising	tide	lifts	all	boats	.
And	the	rising	tide	of	India	's	spectacular	economic	growth	has	lifted	over	400	million	Indians	into	a	buoyant	middle	class	.
But	there	are	still	over	650	million	Indians	,	 Pakistani 	 s 	 	,	Sri	 Lankan 	 s 	 	,	 Bangladesh 	 is 	 	,	Nepalese	,	who	remain	washed	up	on	the	 shore 	 s 	 	of	poverty	.
Therefore	as	India	and	Pakistan	,	as	you	and	I	,	it	 behoove 	 s 	 	us	to	transcend	our	differences	,	to	 celebrat 	 e 	 	our	diversity	,	to	leverage	our	common	humanity	.
Our	collective	vision	at	Naya	Jeevan	,	which	for	many	of	you	,	as	you	all	 recogniz 	 e 	 	,	means	``	new	life	''	in	Urdu	and	Hindi	,	is	to	 rejuvenat 	 e 	 	the	lives	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	low	income	families	by	providing	them	with	affordable	access	to	 catastroph 	 ic 	 	health	care	.
Indeed	it	is	the	emerging	world	's	first	HMO	for	the	urban	working	poor	.
Why	should	we	do	this	as	Indians	and	 Pakistani 	 s 	 	?
We	are	but	two	threads	cut	from	the	same	cloth	.
And	if	our	 fat 	 es 	 	are	 intertwine 	 d 	 	,	then	we	believe	that	it	is	good	karma	,	it	is	good	fortune	.
And	for	many	of	us	,	our	 fortune 	 s 	 	do	 inde 	 ed 	 	lie	at	the	bottom	of	the	pyramid	.	Thank	you	.
Chris	Anderson	:	Fantastic	.	Just	stay	up	here	.
That	was	fantastic	.
I	found	that	 re 	 ally 	 	moving	.
You	know	,	we	fought	hard	to	get	at	least	a	small	Pakistani	contingent	to	come	.
It	felt	like	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	important	.
They	went	through	a	lot	to	get	here	.
Would	the	 Pakistani 	 s 	 	please	just	stand	up	please	?
I	just	 re 	 ally 	 	wanted	to	 acknowledg 	 e 	 	you	.
Thank	you	so	much	.
http	:	//www.ted.com/talks/stefon_harris_there_are_no_mistakes_on_the_bandstand.html
What	is	a	mistake	?	By	talking	through	examples	with	his	 improvisation 	 al 	 	Jazz	quartet	,	 Stef 	 on 	 	Harris	walks	us	to	a	profound	truth	:	many	actions	are	perceived	as	 mistake 	 s 	 	only	because	we	do	n't	react	to	them	 appropriate 	 ly 	 	.
culture	,	entertainment	,	jazz	,	music
1298
 Stef 	 on 	 	Harris	:	There	are	no	 mistake 	 s 	 	on	the	 band 	 stand 	 
Okay	,	I	have	no	idea	what	we	're	going	to	play	.
I	wo	n't	be	able	to	tell	you	what	it	is	until	it	 happen 	 s 	 	.
I	did	n't	 realiz 	 e 	 	there	was	going	to	be	a	little	music	before	.
So	I	think	I	'm	going	to	start	with	what	I	just	heard	.
Okay	,	so	first	of	all	,	let	's	welcome	Mr.	 Jami 	 re 	 	Williams	on	the	drums	,	 Burnis 	 s 	 	Travis	on	the	bass	,	and	Mr.	Christian	Sands	on	the	piano	.
So	the	 band 	 stand 	 	,	as	we	call	it	,	this	is	an	 incredibl 	 e 	 	space	.
It	is	 re 	 ally 	 	a	sacred	space	.
And	one	of	the	things	that	is	 re 	 ally 	 	sacred	about	it	is	that	you	have	no	opportunity	to	think	about	the	future	,	or	the	past	.
You	 re 	 ally 	 	are	alive	right	here	in	this	moment	.
There	are	so	many	decisions	being	made	when	you	walk	on	the	 band 	 stand 	 	.
We	had	no	idea	what	key	we	were	going	to	play	in	.
In	the	middle	,	we	sort	of	made	our	way	into	a	song	called	``	Titi	Boom	.	''
But	that	could	have	happened	--	maybe	,	maybe	not	.
Everyone	's	 listen 	 ing 	 	.	We	're	responding	.
You	have	no	time	for	 project 	 ed 	 	ideas	.
So	the	idea	of	a	mistake	:	From	the	perspective	of	a	jazz	musician	,	it	's	easier	to	talk	about	someone	else	's	mistake	.
So	the	way	I	 perceiv 	 e 	 	a	mistake	when	I	'm	on	the	 band 	 stand 	 	--	first	of	all	,	we	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	see	it	as	a	mistake	.
The	only	mistake	lies	in	that	I	'm	not	able	to	 perceiv 	 e 	 	what	it	is	that	someone	else	did	.
Every	``	mistake	''	is	an	opportunity	in	jazz	.
So	it	's	hard	to	even	describe	what	a	funny	note	would	be	.
So	for	example	,	if	I	played	a	color	,	like	we	were	playing	on	a	palette	,	that	 sound 	 ed 	 	like	this	...
So	if	Christian	played	a	note	--	like	play	an	F	.
See	,	these	are	all	right	inside	of	the	color	palette	.
If	you	played	an	E	.
See	,	these	all	lie	right	inside	of	this	general	emotional	palette	that	we	were	painting	.
If	you	played	an	F	#	though	,	to	most	people	's	ears	,	they	would	 perceiv 	 e 	 	that	as	a	mistake	.
So	I	'm	going	to	show	you	,	we	're	going	to	play	just	for	a	second	.
And	we	're	going	to	play	on	this	palette	.
And	at	some	point	,	Christian	will	 introduc 	 e 	 	this	note	.
And	we	wo	n't	react	to	it	.
He	'll	 introduc 	 e 	 	it	for	a	second	and	then	I	'll	stop	,	I	'll	talk	for	a	second	.
We	'll	see	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	we	play	with	this	palette	.
So	someone	could	 conceptual 	 ly 	 	 perceiv 	 e 	 	that	as	a	mistake	.
The	only	way	that	I	would	say	it	was	a	mistake	is	in	that	we	did	n't	react	to	it	.
It	was	an	opportunity	that	was	missed	.
So	it	's	 un 	 predict 	 able 	 	.	We	'll	paint	this	palette	again	.
He	'll	play	it	.	I	do	n't	know	how	we	'll	react	to	it	,	but	something	will	change	.
We	'll	all	accept	his	ideas	,	or	not	.
So	you	see	,	he	played	this	note	.
I	ended	up	creating	a	melody	out	of	it	.
The	texture	changed	in	the	drums	this	time	.
It	got	a	little	bit	more	rhythmic	,	a	little	bit	more	intense	in	response	to	how	I	 respond 	 ed 	 	to	it	.
So	there	is	no	mistake	.
The	only	mistake	is	if	I	'm	not	aware	,	if	each	individual	musician	is	not	aware	and	 accept 	 ing 	 	enough	of	his	fellow	band	member	to	incorporate	the	idea	and	we	do	n't	allow	for	creativity	.
So	jazz	,	this	 band 	 stand 	 	is	 absolute 	 ly 	 	amazing	.
It	's	a	very	 pur 	 ifying 	 	experience	.
And	I	know	that	I	speak	for	all	of	us	when	I	tell	you	that	we	do	n't	take	it	for	granted	.
We	know	that	to	be	able	to	come	on	the	 band 	 stand 	 	and	play	music	is	a	blessing	.
So	how	does	this	all	relate	to	behavioral	finance	?
Well	we	're	jazz	musicians	,	so	 stereotypic 	 ally 	 	we	do	n't	have	a	great	relationship	to	finance	.
Anyway	,	I	just	wanted	to	sort	of	point	out	the	way	that	we	handle	it	.
And	the	other	dynamic	of	it	is	that	we	do	n't	 micro 	 manage 	 	in	jazz	.
You	have	some	people	who	do	.
But	what	that	does	is	it	actually	limits	the	artistic	 possibilit 	 ies 	 	.
If	I	come	up	and	I	 dictat 	 e 	 	to	the	band	that	I	want	to	play	like	this	and	I	want	the	music	to	go	this	way	,	and	I	just	jump	right	in	...
ready	,	just	play	some	time	.
One	,	two	,	one	,	two	,	three	,	four	.
It	's	kind	of	chaotic	because	I	'm	bullying	my	ideas	.
I	'm	telling	them	,	``	You	come	with	me	over	this	way	.	''
If	I	 re 	 ally 	 	want	the	music	to	go	there	,	the	best	way	for	me	to	do	it	is	to	listen	.
This	is	a	science	of	 listen 	 ing 	 	.
It	has	far	more	to	do	with	what	I	can	 perceiv 	 e 	 	than	what	it	is	that	I	can	do	.
So	if	I	want	the	music	to	get	to	a	certain	level	of	intensity	,	the	first	step	for	me	is	to	be	patient	,	to	listen	to	what	's	going	on	and	pull	from	something	that	's	going	on	around	me	.
When	you	do	that	,	you	engage	and	inspire	the	other	musicians	and	they	give	you	more	,	and	 gradual 	 ly 	 	it	 build 	 s 	 	.
Watch	.	One	,	two	,	a	one	,	two	,	three	,	four	.
 Total 	 ly 	 	different	experience	when	I	'm	pulling	ideas	.
It	's	much	more	organic	.	It	's	much	more	 nu 	 anced 	 	.
It	's	not	about	bullying	my	vision	or	anything	like	that	.
It	's	about	being	here	in	the	moment	,	 accept 	 ing 	 	one	another	and	 a 	 llowing 	 	creativity	to	flow	.
Thank	you	.

We	're	testing	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	simple	 sensor 	 - 	 network 	 	technologies	in	the	home	so	that	any	phone	that	a	senior	is	already	 comfortabl 	 e 	 	with	can	help	them	deal	with	their	 medication 	 s 	 	.
And	a	lot	of	what	they	do	is	they	pick	up	the	phone	,	and	it	's	our	system	 whisper 	 ing 	 	to	them	which	pill	they	need	to	take	,	and	they	fake	like	they	're	having	a	conversation	with	a	friend	.
And	they	're	not	 embarrass 	 ed 	 	by	a	 med 	 s 	 	caddy	that	's	ugly	,	that	sits	on	their	kitchen	table	and	says	,	``	I	'm	old	.	I	'm	frail	.	''
It	's	 surrept 	 itious 	 	technology	that	's	 help 	 ing 	 	them	do	a	simple	task	of	taking	the	right	pill	at	the	right	time	.
Now	,	we	also	do	some	pretty	amazing	things	with	these	phones	.
Because	that	moment	when	you	answer	the	phone	is	a	cognitive	test	every	time	that	you	do	it	.
Think	about	it	,	all	right	?	I	'm	going	to	answer	the	phone	three	different	times	.
``	Hello	?	Hey	.	''
All	right	?	That	's	the	first	time	.
``	Hello	?	Uh	,	hey	.	''
``	Hello	?	Uh	,	who	?
Oh	,	hey	.	''
All	right	?	Very	big	differences	between	the	way	I	answered	the	phone	the	three	times	.
And	as	we	monitor	phone	usage	by	 senior 	 s 	 	over	a	long	period	of	time	,	down	to	the	 tenth 	 s 	 	of	a	 micro 	 second 	 	,	that	recognition	moment	of	whether	they	can	figure	out	that	person	on	the	other	end	is	a	friend	and	we	start	talking	to	them	 immediate 	 ly 	 	,	or	they	do	a	lot	of	what	's	called	trouble	talk	,	where	they	're	like	,	``	Wait	,	who	is	this	?	Oh	.	''	Right	?
Waiting	for	that	recognition	moment	may	be	the	best	early	indicator	of	the	onset	of	dementia	than	anything	that	shows	up	 clinical 	 ly 	 	today	.
We	call	these	behavioral	markers	.
There	's	lots	of	others	.	Is	the	person	going	to	the	phone	as	quickly	,	when	it	rings	,	as	they	used	to	?
Is	it	a	hearing	problem	or	is	it	a	 physical 	 ity 	 	problem	?
Has	their	voice	gotten	more	quiet	?	We	're	 do 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	work	with	people	with	Alzheimer	's	and	 particular 	 ly 	 	with	Parkinson	's	,	where	that	quiet	voice	that	sometimes	shows	up	with	Parkinson	's	patients	may	be	the	best	early	indicator	of	Parkinson	's	five	to	10	years	before	it	shows	up	 clinical 	 ly 	 	.
But	those	subtle	changes	in	your	voice	over	a	long	period	of	time	are	hard	for	you	or	your	spouse	to	notice	until	it	becomes	so	extreme	and	your	voice	has	become	so	quiet	.
So	,	sensors	are	looking	at	that	kind	of	voice	.
When	you	pick	up	the	phone	,	how	much	tremor	are	you	having	,	and	what	is	that	like	,	and	what	is	that	trend	like	over	a	period	of	time	?
Are	you	having	more	trouble	 dia 	 ling 	 	the	phone	than	you	used	to	?
Is	it	a	 dexter 	 ity 	 	problem	?	Is	it	the	onset	of	arthritis	?
Are	you	 us 	 ing 	 	the	phone	?	Are	you	 social 	 izing 	 	less	than	you	used	to	?
