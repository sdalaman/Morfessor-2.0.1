 She 	 a 	 	 Hem 	 brey 	 	:	How	I	 be 	 came 	 	100	 artist 	 s 	 
I	'm	a	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	artist	with	a	bit	of	an	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	 back 	 ground 	 	.
I	was	in	my	20s	before	I	ever	went	to	an	art	museum	.
I	grew	up	in	the	middle	of	 no 	 where 	 	on	a	dirt	road	in	 r 	 ural 	 	 Ark 	 ansas 	 	,	an	hour	from	the	 near 	 est 	 	movie	theater	.
And	I	think	it	was	a	great	place	to	grow	up	 a 	 s 	 	an	artist	 be 	 cause 	 	I	grew	up	around	 quirk 	 y 	 	,	 color 	 ful 	 	 character 	 s 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	great	at	making	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	.
And	my	 child 	 hood 	 	is	more	hick	than	I	could	ever	possibly	 re 	 late 	 	to	you	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	more	intellectual	than	you	would	ever	expect	.
For	 in 	 stance 	 	,	me	and	my	sister	,	when	we	 we 	 re 	 	little	,	we	would	compete	to	see	who	could	eat	the	most	squirrel	 brain 	 s 	 	.
But	on	the	other	side	of	that	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	big	 read 	 ers 	 	in	our	house	.
And	if	the	TV	was	on	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	 watch 	 ing 	 	a	 document 	 ary 	 	.
And	my	dad	is	the	most	 vor 	 acious 	 	 read 	 er 	 	I	know	.
He	can	read	a	novel	or	two	a	day	.
But	when	I	was	little	,	I	remember	,	he	would	kill	flies	in	our	house	with	my	BB	gun	.
And	what	was	so	 amaz 	 ing 	 	to	me	about	that	--	well	he	would	be	in	his	 recline 	 r 	 	,	would	holler	for	me	to	fetch	the	BB	gun	,	and	I	'd	go	get	it	.
And	what	was	 amaz 	 ing 	 	to	me	--	well	it	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	 kick 	 ass 	 	;	he	was	 kill 	 ing 	 	a	fly	in	the	house	with	a	gun	--	but	what	was	so	 amaz 	 ing 	 	to	me	was	that	he	 k 	 new 	 	just	 en 	 ough 	 	how	to	pump	it	.
And	he	could	shoot	it	from	two	rooms	away	and	not	damage	what	it	was	on	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 k 	 new 	 	how	to	pump	it	just	 en 	 ough 	 	to	kill	the	fly	and	not	damage	what	it	 land 	 ed 	 	on	.
So	I	should	talk	about	art	.
Or	we	'll	be	here	all	day	with	my	 child 	 hood 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	.
I	love	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	art	,	but	I	'm	often	 re 	 ally 	 	 frust 	 rated 	 	with	the	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	art	world	and	the	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	art	scene	.
A	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	I	 s 	 pent 	 	 month 	 s 	 	in	 Euro 	 pe 	 	to	see	the	major	 inter 	 national 	 	art	 exhibit 	 ions 	 	that	have	the	 puls 	 e 	 	of	what	is	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	going	on	in	the	art	world	.
And	I	was	 s 	 truck 	 	by	going	to	so	 man 	 y 	 	,	one	after	the	other	,	with	some	 clar 	 ity 	 	of	what	it	was	that	I	was	 long 	 ing 	 	for	.
And	I	was	 long 	 ing 	 	for	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	I	was	n't	 get 	 ting 	 	,	or	not	 get 	 ting 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	of	.
But	two	of	the	main	 thing 	 s 	 	:	one	of	it	,	I	was	 long 	 ing 	 	for	more	work	that	was	 appeal 	 ing 	 	to	a	broad	public	,	that	was	 access 	 ible 	 	.
And	the	second	thing	that	I	was	 long 	 ing 	 	for	was	some	more	exquisite	 craft 	 s 	 man 	 ship 	 	and	 techni 	 que 	 	.
So	I	 start 	 ed 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	and	 list 	 ing 	 	what	all	it	was	that	I	thought	would	make	a	perfect	biennial	.
So	I	 decide 	 d 	 	,	I	'm	going	to	start	my	own	biennial	.
I	'm	going	to	organize	it	and	direct	it	and	get	it	going	in	the	world	.
So	I	thought	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	I	have	to	have	some	 cri 	 ter 	 ia 	 	of	how	to	 choos 	 e 	 	work	.
So	 among 	 st 	 	all	the	 cri 	 ter 	 ia 	 	I	have	,	there	's	two	main	 thing 	 s 	 	.
One	of	them	,	I	call	my	Mimaw	's	 T 	 est 	 	.
And	what	that	is	is	I	imagine	 explain 	 ing 	 	a	work	of	art	to	my	 grand 	 mother 	 	in	five	 minute 	 s 	 	,	and	if	I	ca	n't	explain	it	in	five	 minute 	 s 	 	,	then	it	's	too	 obt 	 use 	 	or	esoteric	and	it	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 be 	 en 	 	 refine 	 d 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	yet	.
It	 need 	 s 	 	to	 work 	 ed 	 	on	 un 	 til 	 	it	can	speak	 fluent 	 ly 	 	.
And	then	my	other	second	set	of	 rule 	 s 	 	--	I	hate	to	say	``	 rule 	 s 	 	''	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	art	--	my	 cri 	 ter 	 ia 	 	would	be	the	three	H	's	,	which	is	head	,	heart	and	 hand 	 s 	 	.
And	great	art	would	have	``	head	''	:	it	would	have	 interest 	 ing 	 	intellectual	 idea 	 s 	 	and	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	.
It	would	have	``	heart	''	in	that	it	would	have	 pass 	 ion 	 	and	heart	and	soul	.
And	it	would	have	``	hand	''	in	that	it	would	be	 great 	 ly 	 	 craft 	 ed 	 	.
So	I	 start 	 ed 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	how	am	I	going	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	biennial	,	how	am	I	going	to	travel	the	world	and	find	these	 artist 	 s 	 	?
And	then	I	 real 	 ized 	 	one	day	,	there	's	an	 eas 	 ier 	 	solution	to	 th 	 is 	 	.
I	'm	just	going	to	make	the	whole	thing	 my 	 self 	 	.
And	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	I	did	.
So	I	thought	,	a	biennial	 need 	 s 	 	 artist 	 s 	 	.
I	'm	going	to	do	an	 inter 	 national 	 	biennial	;	I	need	 artist 	 s 	 	from	all	around	the	world	.
So	what	I	did	was	I	 invent 	 ed 	 	a	hundred	 artist 	 s 	 	from	around	the	world	.
I	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	 the 	 ir 	 	 bio 	 s 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 pass 	 ions 	 	in	life	and	 the 	 ir 	 	art	 style 	 s 	 	,	and	I	 start 	 ed 	 	making	 the 	 ir 	 	work	.
I	felt	,	oh	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	kind	of	project	that	I	could	 s 	 pend 	 	my	whole	life	 do 	 ing 	 	.
So	I	 decide 	 d 	 	,	I	'm	going	to	make	 th 	 is 	 	a	real	biennial	.
It	's	going	to	be	two	 year 	 s 	 	of	studio	work	.
And	I	'm	going	to	create	 th 	 is 	 	in	two	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	I	have	.
So	I	should	start	to	talk	about	these	 guy 	 s 	 	.
Well	the	range	is	 quit 	 e 	 	a	bit	.
And	I	'm	 s 	 uch 	 	a	technician	,	so	I	 love 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	project	,	 get 	 ting 	 	to	play	with	all	the	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	.
So	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	in	 re 	 alist 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	it	 range 	 s 	 	from	 th 	 is 	 	,	which	is	kind	of	old	 master 	 s 	 	style	,	to	 re 	 ally 	 	realistic	 still 	 - 	 life 	 	,	to	 th 	 is 	 	type	of	 paint 	 ing 	 	where	I	'm	 paint 	 ing 	 	with	a	single	hair	.
And	then	at	the	other	end	,	there	's	performance	and	short	 film 	 s 	 	and	 in 	 door 	 	 install 	 ations 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 door 	 	 install 	 ation 	 	and	 th 	 is 	 	one	,	and	 out 	 door 	 	 install 	 ations 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	one	and	 th 	 is 	 	one	.
I	know	I	should	 ment 	 ion 	 	:	I	'm	making	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	n't	 Photo 	 s 	 hopped 	 	.
I	'm	under	the	river	with	 t 	 hose 	 	fish	.
So	now	let	me	 introduc 	 e 	 	some	of	my	 fiction 	 al 	 	 artist 	 s 	 	to	you	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 N 	 ell 	 	 Rem 	 mel 	 	.
 N 	 ell 	 	is	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 agricultur 	 al 	 	 process 	 es 	 	,	and	her	work	is	based	in	these	 practice 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	piece	,	which	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 F 	 lipped 	 	Earth	''	--	she	was	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	taking	the	sky	and	using	it	to	 clean 	 s 	 e 	 	 bar 	 ren 	 	ground	.
And	by	taking	giant	 mirror 	 s 	 	--	and	here	she	's	taking	giant	 mirror 	 s 	 	and	 pull 	 ing 	 	them	 in 	 to 	 	the	dirt	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	22	feet	long	.
And	what	I	 love 	 d 	 	about	her	work	is	,	when	I	would	walk	around	it	and	look	down	 in 	 to 	 	the	sky	,	looking	down	to	watch	the	sky	,	and	it	 un 	 fold 	 ed 	 	in	a	new	way	.
And	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	best	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	piece	is	at	 du 	 s 	 k 	 	and	dawn	when	the	 t 	 wi 	 light 	 	wedge	 ha 	 s 	 	 fall 	 en 	 	and	the	ground	's	dark	,	but	there	's	still	the	light	above	,	bright	above	.
And	so	you	're	 stand 	 ing 	 	there	and	 every 	 thing 	 	else	is	dark	,	but	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	 port 	 al 	 	that	you	want	to	jump	in	.
 Th 	 is 	 	piece	was	great	.	 Th 	 is 	 	is	in	my	 parent 	 s 	 	'	 back 	 yard 	 	in	 Ark 	 ansas 	 	.
And	I	love	to	dig	a	hole	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	piece	was	great	 f 	 un 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	two	 day 	 s 	 	of	 dig 	 ging 	 	in	soft	dirt	.
The	next	artist	is	Kay	 Over 	 stry 	 	,	and	she	's	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 ephemeral 	 ity 	 	and	 trans 	 i 	 ence 	 	.
And	in	her	most	 re 	 cent 	 	project	,	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	Weather	I	 Mad 	 e 	 	.	''
And	she	's	making	weather	on	her	body	's	scale	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	piece	is	``	Frost	.	''
And	what	she	did	was	she	went	out	on	a	cold	,	dry	night	and	 breath 	 ed 	 	back	and	forth	on	the	lawn	to	 leav 	 e 	 	--	to	 leav 	 e 	 	her	life	's	mark	,	the	mark	of	her	life	.
And	so	 th 	 is 	 	is	 five 	 - 	 foot 	 	,	 five 	 - 	 inch 	 es 	 	of	frost	that	she	left	 be 	 hind 	 	.
The	 s 	 un 	 	 rise 	 s 	 	,	and	it	 melt 	 s 	 	away	.
And	that	was	 play 	 ed 	 	by	my	mom	.
So	the	next	artist	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	group	of	 Japan 	 ese 	 	 artist 	 s 	 	,	a	 collect 	 ive 	 	of	 Japan 	 ese 	 	 artist 	 s 	 	--	in	 To 	 kyo 	 	.
And	they	 we 	 re 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 develop 	 ing 	 	a	new	,	 alter 	 native 	 	art	space	,	and	they	 need 	 ed 	 	 fund 	 ing 	 	for	it	,	so	they	 decide 	 d 	 	to	come	up	with	some	 interest 	 ing 	 	 fund 	 raising 	 	 project 	 s 	 	.
One	of	these	is	 scratch 	 - 	 off 	 	 master 	 piece 	 s 	 	.
And	so	what	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	--	each	of	these	 artist 	 s 	 	on	a	 nine 	 - 	 by 	 - 	 seven 	 - 	 inch 	 	card	,	which	they	sell	for	10	 buck 	 s 	 	,	they	drew	original	 work 	 s 	 	of	art	.
And	you	buy	one	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	you	get	a	real	piece	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	not	.
Well	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 spark 	 ed 	 	a	craze	in	Japan	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 every 	 one 	 	's	 want 	 ing 	 	a	 master 	 piece 	 	.
And	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	are	the	most	 s 	 ought 	 	after	are	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	are	 on 	 ly 	 	 bare 	 ly 	 	 scratch 	 ed 	 	off	.
And	all	these	 work 	 s 	 	,	in	some	way	,	talk	about	luck	or	fate	or	chance	.
 T 	 hose 	 	first	two	are	 portrait 	 s 	 	of	 mega 	 - 	 jack 	 pot 	 	 winner 	 s 	 	 year 	 s 	 	before	and	after	 the 	 ir 	 	win	.
And	in	 th 	 is 	 	one	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 D 	 raw 	 ing 	 	the	Short	Stick	.	''
I	love	 th 	 is 	 	piece	 be 	 cause 	 	I	have	a	little	cousin	at	home	who	 introduc 	 ed 	 	me	--	which	I	think	is	 s 	 uch 	 	a	great	 introduc 	 tion 	 	--	to	a	friend	one	day	 a 	 s 	 	,	``	 Th 	 is 	 	is	my	cousin	 She 	 a 	 	.
He	 draw 	 s 	 	 stick 	 s 	 	real	good	.	''
 Whi 	 ch 	 	is	one	of	the	best	 compliment 	 s 	 	ever	.
 Th 	 is 	 	artist	is	Gus	 Wein 	 mueller 	 	,	and	he	's	 do 	 ing 	 	a	project	,	a	large	project	,	 call 	 ed 	 	``	Art	for	the	 People 	 s 	 	.	''
And	 with 	 in 	 	 th 	 is 	 	project	,	he	's	 do 	 ing 	 	a	 small 	 er 	 	project	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 Art 	 ists 	 	in	 Resi 	 d 	 ence 	 	.	''
And	what	he	 do 	 es 	 	is	--	he	 s 	 pend 	 s 	 	a	week	at	a	time	with	a	family	.
And	he	 show 	 s 	 	up	on	 the 	 ir 	 	porch	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 door 	 step 	 	,	with	a	 tooth 	 brush 	 	and	 pajama 	 s 	 	,	and	he	's	ready	to	 s 	 pend 	 	the	week	with	them	.
And	using	 on 	 ly 	 	what	's	present	,	he	 go 	 es 	 	in	and	 make 	 s 	 	a	little	 abo 	 de 	 	studio	to	work	out	of	.
And	he	 s 	 pend 	 s 	 	that	week	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	the	family	about	what	do	they	think	great	art	is	.
He	 ha 	 s 	 	all	these	 discuss 	 ions 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	family	,	and	he	 dig 	 s 	 	through	 every 	 thing 	 	they	have	,	and	he	 find 	 s 	 	 material 	 s 	 	to	make	work	.
And	he	 make 	 s 	 	a	work	that	 answer 	 s 	 	what	they	think	great	art	is	.
For	 th 	 is 	 	family	,	he	made	 th 	 is 	 	 still 	 - 	 life 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 	.
And	 what 	 ever 	 	he	 make 	 s 	 	 some 	 how 	 	 re 	 ference 	 s 	 	 nest 	 ing 	 	and	space	and	personal	 proper 	 ty 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	next	project	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	by	Jaochim	 Paris 	 vega 	 	,	and	he	's	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	--	he	 believ 	 es 	 	art	is	 every 	 where 	 	 wait 	 ing 	 	--	that	it	just	 need 	 s 	 	a	little	bit	of	a	push	to	happen	.
And	he	 provide 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	push	by	 harness 	 ing 	 	natural	 force 	 s 	 	,	like	in	his	 s 	 eries 	 	where	he	used	rain	to	make	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	project	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	Love	 N 	 est 	 s 	 	.	''
What	he	did	was	to	get	wild	 bird 	 s 	 	to	make	his	art	for	him	.
So	he	put	the	material	in	 place 	 s 	 	where	the	 bird 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	collect	them	,	and	they	 craft 	 ed 	 	his	 nest 	 s 	 	for	him	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	one	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 Love 	 lock 	 	's	 N 	 est 	 	.	''
 Th 	 is 	 	one	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 Mix 	 tape 	 	Love	Song	's	 N 	 est 	 	.	''
And	 th 	 is 	 	one	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 Love 	 making 	 	 N 	 est 	 	.	''
Next	is	Sylvia	 Sla 	 ter 	 	.
Sylvia	's	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	art	training	.
She	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	serious	Swiss	artist	.
And	she	was	 think 	 ing 	 	about	her	 friend 	 s 	 	and	family	who	work	in	 cha 	 os 	 - 	 ridden 	 	 place 	 s 	 	and	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	,	and	she	was	 think 	 ing 	 	,	what	can	I	make	that	would	be	of	value	to	them	,	in	case	 some 	 thing 	 	bad	 happen 	 s 	 	and	they	have	to	buy	 the 	 ir 	 	way	 a 	 cross 	 	the	border	or	pay	off	a	 gun 	 man 	 	?
And	so	she	came	up	with	creating	these	 pocket 	 - 	 sized 	 	 art 	 work 	 s 	 	that	are	 portrait 	 s 	 	of	the	person	that	would	carry	them	.
And	you	would	carry	 th 	 is 	 	around	with	you	,	and	if	 every 	 thing 	 	went	to	hell	,	you	could	make	 payment 	 s 	 	and	buy	your	life	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	life	price	is	for	an	 irrig 	 ation 	 	 non 	 - 	 profit 	 	director	.
So	 hope 	 fully 	 	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	you	never	use	it	,	and	it	's	an	 heir 	 loom 	 	that	you	pass	down	.
And	she	 make 	 s 	 	them	so	they	could	either	be	broken	up	 in 	 to 	 	 payment 	 s 	 	,	or	they	could	be	like	these	,	which	are	 leav 	 es 	 	that	can	be	 payment 	 s 	 	.
And	so	they	're	 valu 	 able 	 	.	 Th 	 is 	 	is	precious	 metal 	 s 	 	and	 gem 	 stone 	 s 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	one	had	to	get	broken	up	.
He	had	to	break	off	a	piece	to	get	out	of	Egypt	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	by	a	 du 	 o 	 	,	Michael	 Ab 	 er 	 na 	 thy 	 	and	Bud	 Hol 	 land 	 	.
And	they	're	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	creating	culture	,	just	tradition	.
So	what	they	do	is	they	move	 in 	 to 	 	an	area	and	try	to	establish	a	new	tradition	in	a	small	 geo 	 graphic 	 	area	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	is	in	 East 	 ern 	 	 Ten 	 ness 	 ee 	 	,	and	what	they	 decide 	 d 	 	was	that	we	need	a	positive	tradition	that	 go 	 es 	 	with	death	.
So	they	came	up	with	``	dig	 jig 	 s 	 	.	''
And	a	dig	jig	--	a	dig	jig	is	where	,	for	a	 mile 	 stone 	 	 annivers 	 ary 	 	or	a	 birth 	 day 	 	,	you	gather	all	your	 friend 	 s 	 	and	family	together	and	you	dance	on	where	you	're	going	to	be	buried	.
And	we	got	a	lot	of	attention	when	we	did	it	.
I	 talk 	 ed 	 	my	family	 in 	 to 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	they	did	n't	know	what	I	was	 do 	 ing 	 	.
And	I	was	like	,	``	Get	 dress 	 ed 	 	for	a	funeral	.	We	're	going	to	go	do	some	work	.	''
And	so	we	got	to	the	grave	and	made	 th 	 is 	 	,	which	was	hilarious	--	the	attention	that	we	got	.
So	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	you	dance	on	the	grave	,	and	after	you	've	 d 	 one 	 	your	dance	,	 every 	 one 	 	 toast 	 s 	 	you	and	 tell 	 s 	 	you	how	great	you	are	.
And	you	in	 es 	 s 	 ence 	 	have	a	funeral	that	you	get	to	be	present	for	.
That	's	my	mom	and	dad	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	by	 Ja 	 son 	 	 Bird 	 song 	 	.
He	is	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	how	we	see	 a 	 s 	 	an	animal	,	how	we	are	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	mimicry	and	camouflage	.
You	know	,	we	look	down	a	dark	 al 	 ley 	 	or	a	jungle	path	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	out	a	face	or	a	creature	.
We	just	have	that	natural	way	of	 see 	 ing 	 	.
And	he	 play 	 s 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	idea	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	piece	:	 t 	 hose 	 	are	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	 leav 	 es 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	 butter 	 fly 	 	 specimen 	 s 	 	who	have	a	natural	camouflage	.
So	he	 pair 	 s 	 	these	up	.
There	's	 an 	 other 	 	pile	of	 leav 	 es 	 	.
 T 	 hose 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	all	real	 butter 	 fly 	 	 specimen 	 s 	 	.
And	he	 pair 	 s 	 	these	up	with	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
Like	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 paint 	 ing 	 	of	a	snake	in	a	box	.
So	you	open	the	box	and	you	think	,	``	 Who 	 a 	 	,	there	's	a	snake	in	there	.	''
But	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 paint 	 ing 	 	.
So	he	 make 	 s 	 	these	 interest 	 ing 	 	 conversation 	 s 	 	about	 real 	 ism 	 	and	mimicry	and	our	drive	to	be	 fool 	 ed 	 	by	great	camouflage	.
The	next	artist	is	Hazel	 Claus 	 en 	 	.
Hazel	 Claus 	 en 	 	is	an	 anthropo 	 logist 	 	who	took	a	sabbatical	and	 decide 	 d 	 	,	``	You	know	,	I	would	learn	a	lot	about	culture	if	I	 create 	 d 	 	a	culture	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	exist	from	scratch	.	''
So	that	's	what	she	did	.
She	 create 	 d 	 	the	Swiss	people	named	the	 Uvul 	 ites 	 	,	and	they	have	 th 	 is 	 	 distinct 	 ive 	 	 yo 	 del 	 ing 	 	song	that	they	use	the	uvula	for	.
And	 al 	 so 	 	they	 re 	 ference 	 	how	the	uvula	--	 every 	 thing 	 	they	say	is	 fall 	 en 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 forbid 	 den 	 	fruit	.
And	that	's	the	symbol	of	 the 	 ir 	 	culture	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	from	a	 document 	 ary 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	``	Sexual	 Practice 	 s 	 	and	 Popul 	 ations 	 	Control	Among	the	 Uvul 	 ites 	 	.	''
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	typical	 ang 	 ora 	 	 embr 	 oid 	 ery 	 	for	them	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 founder 	 s 	 	,	 Ger 	 t 	 	 Schae 	 ffer 	 	.
And	 actual 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	 Au 	 nt 	 	 I 	 rene 	 	.
It	was	so	funny	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	fake	person	who	was	making	fake	 thing 	 s 	 	.
And	I	crack	up	at	 th 	 is 	 	piece	,	 be 	 cause 	 	when	I	see	it	I	know	that	's	French	 ang 	 ora 	 	and	all	 anti 	 que 	 	German	 ribbon 	 s 	 	and	wool	that	I	got	in	a	Nebraska	mill	and	carried	around	for	10	 year 	 s 	 	and	then	 anti 	 que 	 	 Chi 	 nese 	 	 skirt 	 s 	 	.
The	next	is	a	 collect 	 ive 	 	of	 artist 	 s 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	Silver	 Do 	 ber 	 man 	 s 	 	,	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 mot 	 to 	 	is	to	spread	 pragmat 	 ism 	 	one	person	at	a	time	.
And	they	're	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	how	 over 	 - 	 coddled 	 	we	've	 be 	 come 	 	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 comment 	 s 	 	on	how	 over 	 - 	 coddled 	 	we	've	 be 	 come 	 	.
And	what	they	've	 d 	 one 	 	is	they	put	a	 war 	 ning 	 	sign	on	every	single	barb	on	 th 	 is 	 	 f 	 ence 	 	.

 Ro 	 bert 	 	Lang	 fold 	 s 	 	 way 	 - 	 new 	 	origami
My	talk	is	``	 F 	 lap 	 ping 	 	 Bird 	 s 	 	and	Space	 Tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	.	''
And	you	would	think	that	should	have	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	one	 an 	 other 	 	,	but	I	hope	by	the	end	of	these	18	 minute 	 s 	 	,	you	'll	see	a	little	bit	of	a	relation	.
It	ties	to	origami	.	So	let	me	start	.
What	is	origami	?
 Mo 	 st 	 	people	think	they	know	what	origami	is	.	It	's	 th 	 is 	 	:	flapping	 bird 	 s 	 	,	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	,	cootie	 catch 	 ers 	 	,	that	sort	of	thing	.
And	that	is	what	origami	used	to	be	.
But	it	's	 be 	 come 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
It	's	 be 	 come 	 	an	art	form	,	a	form	of	 sculpt 	 ure 	 	.
The	common	theme	--	what	 make 	 s 	 	it	origami	--	is	 fold 	 ing 	 	is	how	we	create	the	form	.
You	know	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	old	.	 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	plate	from	1797	.
It	 show 	 s 	 	these	women	 play 	 ing 	 	with	these	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	.
If	you	look	close	,	it	's	 th 	 is 	 	shape	,	 call 	 ed 	 	a	 cr 	 ane 	 	.
Every	 Japan 	 ese 	 	kid	 learn 	 s 	 	how	to	fold	that	 cr 	 ane 	 	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	art	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	around	for	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	you	would	think	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	around	that	long	--	so	 restrict 	 ive 	 	,	 fold 	 ing 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	--	 every 	 thing 	 	that	could	be	 d 	 one 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 d 	 one 	 	a	long	time	ago	.
And	that	might	have	 be 	 en 	 	the	case	.
But	in	the	 t 	 went 	 ieth 	 	century	,	a	 Japan 	 ese 	 	 fold 	 er 	 	named	 Yo 	 shizawa 	 	came	 a 	 long 	 	,	and	he	 create 	 d 	 	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	new	 design 	 s 	 	.
But	even	more	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	he	 create 	 d 	 	a	language	,	a	way	we	could	communicate	,	a	code	of	 dot 	 s 	 	,	 d 	 ashes 	 	and	 arrow 	 s 	 	.
 Har 	 ken 	 ing 	 	back	to	Susan	 Black 	 more 	 	's	talk	,	we	now	have	a	 mean 	 s 	 	of	 transmit 	 ting 	 	information	with	 her 	 ed 	 ity 	 	and	 s 	 election 	 	,	and	we	know	where	that	 lead 	 s 	 	.
And	where	it	 ha 	 s 	 	led	in	origami	is	to	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	an	origami	figure	--	one	sheet	,	no	 cut 	 s 	 	,	 fold 	 ing 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	,	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 fold 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	,	too	,	is	origami	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 show 	 s 	 	where	we	've	gone	in	the	modern	world	.
 Natural 	 ism 	 	.	 De 	 tail 	 	.
You	can	get	 horn 	 s 	 	,	 ant 	 ler 	 s 	 	--	even	,	if	you	look	close	,	 cl 	 oven 	 	 hoo 	 ves 	 	.
And	it	 raise 	 s 	 	a	question	:	what	 change 	 d 	 	?
And	what	 change 	 d 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	you	might	not	have	 expect 	 ed 	 	in	an	art	,	which	is	math	.
That	is	,	people	 appli 	 ed 	 	 mathematic 	 al 	 	 principle 	 s 	 	to	the	art	,	to	discover	the	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	 law 	 s 	 	.
And	that	 lead 	 s 	 	to	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	tool	.
The	secret	to	 product 	 ivity 	 	in	so	 man 	 y 	 	 field 	 s 	 	--	and	in	origami	--	is	 lett 	 ing 	 	dead	people	do	your	work	for	you	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	what	you	can	do	is	take	your	problem	,	and	turn	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	problem	that	 some 	 one 	 	else	 ha 	 s 	 	 solve 	 d 	 	,	and	use	 the 	 ir 	 	 solution 	 s 	 	.
And	I	want	to	tell	you	how	we	did	that	in	origami	.
 O 	 rigami 	 	 r 	 evolve 	 s 	 	around	crease	 pattern 	 s 	 	.
The	crease	pattern	 show 	 n 	 	here	is	the	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	 blue 	 print 	 	for	an	origami	figure	.
And	you	ca	n't	just	draw	them	 arbitr 	 arily 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	have	to	obey	four	simple	 law 	 s 	 	.
And	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	,	easy	to	understand	.
The	first	law	is	 two 	 - 	 color 	 ability 	 	.	You	can	color	any	crease	pattern	with	just	two	 color 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	ever	 hav 	 ing 	 	the	same	color	 meet 	 ing 	 	.
The	 direction 	 s 	 	of	the	 fold 	 s 	 	at	any	 vert 	 ex 	 	--	the	number	of	mountain	 fold 	 s 	 	,	the	number	of	 val 	 ley 	 	 fold 	 s 	 	--	 al 	 ways 	 	 differ 	 s 	 	by	two	.	Two	more	or	two	less	.
 No 	 thing 	 	else	.
If	you	look	at	the	 angle 	 s 	 	around	the	fold	,	you	find	that	if	you	number	the	 angle 	 s 	 	in	a	circle	,	all	the	 even 	 - 	 number 	 ed 	 	 angle 	 s 	 	add	up	to	a	straight	line	,	all	the	 odd 	 - 	 number 	 ed 	 	 angle 	 s 	 	add	up	to	a	straight	line	.
And	if	you	look	at	how	the	 layer 	 s 	 	stack	,	you	'll	find	that	no	matter	how	you	stack	 fold 	 s 	 	and	 sheet 	 s 	 	,	a	sheet	can	never	penetrate	a	fold	.
So	that	's	four	simple	 law 	 s 	 	.	That	's	all	you	need	in	origami	.
All	of	origami	 come 	 s 	 	from	that	.
And	you	'd	think	,	``	Can	four	simple	 law 	 s 	 	give	rise	to	that	kind	of	 complex 	 ity 	 	?	''
But	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	the	 law 	 s 	 	of	 quant 	 um 	 	 mechanic 	 s 	 	can	be	written	down	on	a	napkin	,	and	yet	they	govern	all	of	 chemist 	 ry 	 	,	all	of	life	,	all	of	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
If	we	obey	these	 law 	 s 	 	,	we	can	do	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
So	in	origami	,	to	obey	these	 law 	 s 	 	,	we	can	take	simple	 pattern 	 s 	 	--	like	 th 	 is 	 	 repeat 	 ing 	 	pattern	of	 fold 	 s 	 	,	 call 	 ed 	 	 text 	 ures 	 	--	and	by	 it 	 self 	 	it	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
But	if	we	follow	the	 law 	 s 	 	of	origami	,	we	can	put	these	 pattern 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 an 	 other 	 	fold	that	 it 	 self 	 	might	be	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	,	but	when	we	put	it	together	,	we	get	 some 	 thing 	 	a	little	different	.
 Th 	 is 	 	fish	,	400	 scale 	 s 	 	--	 aga 	 in 	 	,	it	is	one	 un 	 cut 	 	square	,	 on 	 ly 	 	 fold 	 ing 	 	.
And	if	you	do	n't	want	to	fold	400	 scale 	 s 	 	,	you	can	back	off	and	just	do	a	few	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	add	 plate 	 s 	 	to	the	back	of	a	turtle	,	or	 to 	 es 	 	.
Or	you	can	ramp	up	and	go	up	to	50	 star 	 s 	 	on	a	flag	,	with	13	 strip 	 es 	 	.
And	if	you	want	to	go	 re 	 ally 	 	crazy	,	1,000	 scale 	 s 	 	on	a	 rattle 	 snake 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	guy	's	on	 dis 	 play 	 	 down 	 stair 	 s 	 	,	so	take	a	look	if	you	get	a	chance	.
The	most	 power 	 ful 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	in	origami	have	related	to	how	we	get	 part 	 s 	 	of	 creature 	 s 	 	.
And	I	can	put	it	in	 th 	 is 	 	simple	 equ 	 ation 	 	.
We	take	an	idea	,	combine	it	with	a	square	,	and	you	get	an	origami	figure	.
What	 matter 	 s 	 	is	what	we	mean	by	 t 	 hose 	 	 symbol 	 s 	 	.
And	you	might	say	,	``	Can	you	 re 	 ally 	 	be	that	specific	?
I	mean	,	a	stag	beetle	--	it	's	got	two	 point 	 s 	 	for	 jaw 	 s 	 	,	it	's	got	 antenna 	 e 	 	.	Can	you	be	that	specific	in	the	detail	?	''
And	 yea 	 h 	 	,	you	 re 	 ally 	 	can	.
So	how	do	we	do	that	?	Well	,	we	break	it	down	 in 	 to 	 	a	few	 small 	 er 	 	 step 	 s 	 	.
So	let	me	stretch	out	that	 equ 	 ation 	 	.
I	start	with	my	idea	.	I	abstract	it	.
What	's	the	most	abstract	form	?	It	's	a	stick	figure	.
And	from	that	stick	figure	,	I	 some 	 how 	 	have	to	get	to	a	 fold 	 ed 	 	shape	that	 ha 	 s 	 	a	part	for	every	bit	of	the	subject	,	a	flap	for	every	leg	.
And	then	once	I	have	that	 fold 	 ed 	 	shape	that	we	call	the	base	,	you	can	make	the	 leg 	 s 	 	 narrow 	 er 	 	,	you	can	bend	them	,	you	can	turn	it	 in 	 to 	 	the	 finish 	 ed 	 	shape	.
 N 	 ow 	 	the	first	step	,	 pre 	 tty 	 	easy	.
Take	an	idea	,	draw	a	stick	figure	.
The	last	step	is	not	so	hard	,	but	that	middle	step	--	going	from	the	abstract	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	to	the	 fold 	 ed 	 	shape	--	that	's	hard	.
But	that	's	the	place	where	the	 mathematic 	 al 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	can	get	us	over	the	hump	.
And	I	'm	going	to	show	you	all	how	to	do	that	so	you	can	go	out	of	here	and	fold	 some 	 thing 	 	.
But	we	're	going	to	start	small	.
 Th 	 is 	 	base	 ha 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	 flap 	 s 	 	in	it	.
We	're	going	to	learn	how	to	make	one	flap	.
How	would	you	make	a	single	flap	?
Take	a	square	.	Fold	it	in	half	,	fold	it	in	half	,	fold	it	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 un 	 til 	 	it	 get 	 s 	 	long	and	narrow	,	and	then	we	'll	say	at	the	end	of	that	,	that	's	a	flap	.
I	could	use	that	for	a	leg	,	an	arm	,	 any 	 thing 	 	like	that	.
What	paper	went	 in 	 to 	 	that	flap	?
Well	,	if	I	 un 	 fold 	 	it	and	go	back	to	the	crease	pattern	,	you	can	see	that	the	upper	left	corner	of	that	shape	is	the	paper	that	went	 in 	 to 	 	the	flap	.
So	that	's	the	flap	,	and	all	the	rest	of	the	paper	's	left	over	.
I	can	use	it	for	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
Well	,	there	are	other	ways	of	making	a	flap	.
There	are	other	 dimension 	 s 	 	for	 flap 	 s 	 	.
If	I	make	the	 flap 	 s 	 	 skin 	 ni 	 er 	 	,	I	can	use	a	bit	less	paper	.
If	I	make	the	flap	 a 	 s 	 	 skin 	 ny 	 	 a 	 s 	 	possible	,	I	get	to	the	limit	of	the	 minim 	 um 	 	amount	of	paper	 need 	 ed 	 	.
And	you	can	see	there	,	it	 need 	 s 	 	a	 quarter 	 - 	 circle 	 	of	paper	to	make	a	flap	.
There	's	other	ways	of	making	 flap 	 s 	 	.
If	I	put	the	flap	on	the	edge	,	it	uses	a	half	circle	of	paper	.
And	if	I	make	the	flap	from	the	middle	,	it	uses	a	full	circle	.
So	,	no	matter	how	I	make	a	flap	,	it	 need 	 s 	 	some	part	of	a	 circul 	 ar 	 	region	of	paper	.
So	now	we	're	ready	to	scale	up	.
What	if	I	want	to	make	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	 flap 	 s 	 	?
What	do	I	need	?	I	need	a	lot	of	 circle 	 s 	 	.
And	in	the	1990s	,	origami	 artist 	 s 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	these	 principle 	 s 	 	and	 real 	 ized 	 	we	could	make	 arbitr 	 arily 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	 figure 	 s 	 	just	by	 pack 	 ing 	 	 circle 	 s 	 	.
And	here	's	where	the	dead	people	start	to	help	us	out	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	people	have	 stud 	 ied 	 	the	problem	of	 pack 	 ing 	 	 circle 	 s 	 	.
I	can	 re 	 ly 	 	on	that	vast	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 mathematic 	 ians 	 	and	 artist 	 s 	 	looking	at	 dis 	 c 	 	 pack 	 ing 	 s 	 	and	 arrange 	 ments 	 	.
And	I	can	use	 t 	 hose 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	now	to	create	origami	 shape 	 s 	 	.
So	we	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	these	 rule 	 s 	 	 where 	 by 	 	you	pack	 circle 	 s 	 	,	you	 decor 	 ate 	 	the	 pattern 	 s 	 	of	 circle 	 s 	 	with	lines	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	more	 rule 	 s 	 	.	That	 give 	 s 	 	you	the	 fold 	 s 	 	.
 T 	 hose 	 	 fold 	 s 	 	fold	 in 	 to 	 	a	base	.	You	shape	the	base	.
You	get	a	 fold 	 ed 	 	shape	--	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	a	 cock 	 roach 	 	.
And	it	's	so	simple	.
It	's	so	simple	that	a	computer	could	do	it	.
And	you	say	,	``	Well	,	you	know	,	how	simple	is	that	?	''
But	 computer 	 s 	 	--	you	need	to	be	able	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	in	 ver 	 y 	 	 bas 	 ic 	 	 term 	 s 	 	,	and	with	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	could	.
So	I	wrote	a	computer	program	a	bunch	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	 call 	 ed 	 	 Tree 	 Maker 	 	,	and	you	can	download	it	from	my	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	.
It	's	free	.	It	 run 	 s 	 	on	all	the	major	 platform 	 s 	 	--	even	 Wind 	 ow 	 s 	 	.
And	you	just	draw	a	stick	figure	,	and	it	 calcul 	 ates 	 	the	crease	pattern	.
It	 do 	 es 	 	the	circle	 pack 	 ing 	 	,	 calcul 	 ates 	 	the	crease	pattern	,	and	if	you	use	that	stick	figure	that	I	just	 show 	 ed 	 	--	which	you	can	kind	of	tell	,	it	's	a	 de 	 er 	 	,	it	's	got	 ant 	 ler 	 s 	 	--	you	'll	get	 th 	 is 	 	crease	pattern	.
And	if	you	take	 th 	 is 	 	crease	pattern	,	you	fold	on	the	 dot 	 ted 	 	lines	,	you	'll	get	a	base	that	you	can	then	shape	 in 	 to 	 	a	 de 	 er 	 	,	with	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	crease	pattern	that	you	 want 	 ed 	 	.
And	if	you	want	a	different	 de 	 er 	 	,	not	a	 white 	 - 	 tail 	 ed 	 	 de 	 er 	 	,	but	you	want	a	mule	 de 	 er 	 	,	or	an	 el 	 k 	 	,	you	change	the	 pack 	 ing 	 	,	and	you	can	do	an	 el 	 k 	 	.
Or	you	could	do	a	 mo 	 ose 	 	.
Or	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	any	other	kind	of	 de 	 er 	 	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	 revolution 	 ized 	 	 th 	 is 	 	art	.
We	found	we	could	do	 insect 	 s 	 	,	 spider 	 s 	 	,	which	are	close	,	 thing 	 s 	 	with	 leg 	 s 	 	,	 thing 	 s 	 	with	 leg 	 s 	 	and	 wing 	 s 	 	,	 thing 	 s 	 	with	 leg 	 s 	 	and	 antenna 	 e 	 	.
And	if	 fold 	 ing 	 	a	single	 pray 	 ing 	 	mantis	from	a	single	 un 	 cut 	 	square	was	n't	 interest 	 ing 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	then	you	could	do	two	 pray 	 ing 	 	 mantis 	 es 	 	from	a	single	 un 	 cut 	 	square	.
She	's	eating	him	.
I	call	it	``	 Sn 	 ack 	 	Time	.	''
And	you	can	do	more	than	just	 insect 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	--	you	can	put	 detail 	 s 	 	,	 to 	 es 	 	and	 claw 	 s 	 	.	A	 grizz 	 ly 	 	bear	 ha 	 s 	 	 claw 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	tree	frog	 ha 	 s 	 	 to 	 es 	 	.
 Actu 	 ally 	 	,	 lot 	 s 	 	of	people	in	origami	now	put	 to 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 model 	 s 	 	.
 To 	 es 	 	have	 be 	 come 	 	an	origami	meme	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 every 	 one 	 	's	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
You	can	make	 multi 	 ple 	 	 subject 	 s 	 	.
So	these	are	a	couple	of	 instrument 	 alist 	 s 	 	.
The	guitar	player	from	a	single	square	,	the	 bas 	 s 	 	player	from	a	single	square	.
And	if	you	say	,	``	Well	,	but	the	guitar	,	 bas 	 s 	 	--	that	's	not	so	hot	.
Do	a	little	more	 complic 	 ated 	 	instrument	.	''
Well	,	then	you	could	do	an	organ	.
And	what	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 allow 	 ed 	 	is	the	creation	of	 origami 	 - 	 on 	 - 	 demand 	 	.
So	now	people	can	say	,	``	I	want	 exact 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	and	 th 	 is 	 	and	 th 	 is 	 	,	''	and	you	can	go	out	and	fold	it	.
And	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	you	create	high	art	,	and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	you	pay	the	 bill 	 s 	 	by	 do 	 ing 	 	some	commercial	work	.
But	I	want	to	show	you	some	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
 Every 	 thing 	 	you	'll	see	here	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	the	car	,	is	origami	.
Just	to	show	you	,	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	was	 fold 	 ed 	 	paper	.
 Compu 	 ter 	 s 	 	made	 thing 	 s 	 	move	,	but	these	 we 	 re 	 	all	real	,	 fold 	 ed 	 	 object 	 s 	 	that	we	made	.
And	we	can	use	 th 	 is 	 	not	just	for	 visual 	 s 	 	,	but	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	be	 use 	 ful 	 	even	in	the	real	world	.
 Surpris 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	origami	and	the	 structure 	 s 	 	that	we	've	 develop 	 ed 	 	in	origami	turn	out	to	have	 application 	 s 	 	in	medicine	,	in	science	,	in	space	,	in	the	body	,	consumer	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	and	more	.
And	I	want	to	show	you	some	of	these	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
One	of	the	 ear 	 liest 	 	was	 th 	 is 	 	pattern	,	 th 	 is 	 	 fold 	 ed 	 	pattern	,	 stud 	 ied 	 	by	Koryo	 Mi 	 ura 	 	,	a	 Japan 	 ese 	 	engineer	.
He	 stud 	 ied 	 	a	 fold 	 ing 	 	pattern	,	and	 real 	 ized 	 	 th 	 is 	 	could	fold	down	 in 	 to 	 	an	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	compact	package	that	had	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 open 	 ing 	 	and	 clo 	 s 	 ing 	 	structure	.
And	he	used	it	to	design	 th 	 is 	 	solar	array	.
It	's	an	artist	's	 rend 	 ition 	 	,	but	it	flew	in	a	 Japan 	 ese 	 	 tele 	 scope 	 	in	1995	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	there	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	little	origami	in	the	 Jam 	 es 	 	 Web 	 b 	 	Space	 Tele 	 scope 	 	,	but	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	.
The	 tele 	 scope 	 	,	going	up	in	space	,	it	 un 	 fold 	 s 	 	in	two	 place 	 s 	 	.
It	 fold 	 s 	 	in	 third 	 s 	 	.	It	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	pattern	--	you	would	n't	even	call	that	origami	.
 The 	 y 	 	 certain 	 ly 	 	did	n't	need	to	talk	to	origami	 artist 	 s 	 	.
But	if	you	want	to	go	 high 	 er 	 	and	go	 large 	 r 	 	than	 th 	 is 	 	,	then	you	might	need	some	origami	.
 Engineer 	 s 	 	at	 Law 	 rence 	 	 Liver 	 more 	 	National	Lab	had	an	idea	for	a	 tele 	 scope 	 	much	 large 	 r 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	it	the	 Eye 	 glass 	 	.
The	design	 call 	 ed 	 	for	 geo 	 synchron 	 ous 	 	orbit	25,000	 mile 	 s 	 	up	,	100-meter	 dia 	 meter 	 	lens	.
So	,	imagine	a	lens	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	a	 foot 	 ball 	 	field	.
There	 we 	 re 	 	two	 group 	 s 	 	of	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	:	planetary	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	who	want	to	look	up	,	and	then	other	people	,	who	 want 	 ed 	 	to	look	down	.
 W 	 he 	 ther 	 	you	look	up	or	look	down	,	how	do	you	get	it	up	in	space	?	You	've	got	to	get	it	up	there	in	a	rocket	.
And	 rocket 	 s 	 	are	small	.	So	you	have	to	make	it	 small 	 er 	 	.
How	do	you	make	a	large	sheet	of	glass	 small 	 er 	 	?
Well	,	about	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	is	to	fold	it	up	 some 	 how 	 	.
So	you	have	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	was	a	small	model	.
 Fold 	 ed 	 	lens	,	you	divide	up	the	 pan 	 el 	 s 	 	,	you	add	 flex 	 ures 	 	.
But	 th 	 is 	 	pattern	's	not	going	to	work	to	get	 some 	 thing 	 	100	 meter 	 s 	 	down	to	a	few	 meter 	 s 	 	.
So	the	 Liver 	 more 	 	 engineer 	 s 	 	,	 want 	 ing 	 	to	make	use	of	the	work	of	dead	people	,	or	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	live	 origami 	 st 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Let	's	see	if	 some 	 one 	 	else	is	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	thing	.	''
So	they	 look 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	origami	community	,	we	got	in	touch	with	them	,	and	I	 start 	 ed 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	with	them	.
And	we	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	pattern	together	that	 scale 	 s 	 	to	 arbitr 	 arily 	 	large	 s 	 ize 	 	,	but	that	 allow 	 s 	 	any	flat	ring	or	 dis 	 c 	 	to	fold	down	 in 	 to 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	neat	,	compact	cylinder	.
And	they	 adopt 	 ed 	 	that	for	 the 	 ir 	 	first	generation	,	which	was	not	100	 meter 	 s 	 	--	it	was	a	 five 	 - 	 meter 	 	.
But	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 five 	 - 	 meter 	 	 tele 	 scope 	 	--	 ha 	 s 	 	about	a	 quarter 	 - 	 mile 	 	 f 	 oc 	 al 	 	length	.
And	it	 work 	 s 	 	 perfect 	 ly 	 	on	 it 	 s 	 	test	range	,	and	it	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	 fold 	 s 	 	up	 in 	 to 	 	a	neat	little	 bundl 	 e 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	there	is	other	origami	in	space	.
Japan	 Aero 	 space 	 	[	 Explo 	 ration 	 	]	 Age 	 ncy 	 	flew	a	solar	sail	,	and	you	can	see	here	that	the	sail	 expand 	 s 	 	out	,	and	you	can	still	see	the	fold	lines	.
The	problem	that	's	 be 	 ing 	 	 solve 	 d 	 	here	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	big	and	 sheet 	 - 	 like 	 	at	 it 	 s 	 	destination	,	but	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	small	for	the	journey	.
And	that	 work 	 s 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	you	're	going	 in 	 to 	 	space	,	or	 whet 	 her 	 	you	're	just	going	 in 	 to 	 	a	body	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	is	the	 lat 	 ter 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	heart	 s 	 tent 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	by	Zhong	You	at	Oxford	 Univers 	 ity 	 	.
It	 hold 	 s 	 	open	a	 block 	 ed 	 	 art 	 ery 	 	when	it	 get 	 s 	 	to	 it 	 s 	 	destination	,	but	it	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	much	 small 	 er 	 	for	the	trip	there	,	through	your	blood	 vessel 	 s 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 tent 	 	 fold 	 s 	 	down	using	an	origami	pattern	,	based	on	a	model	 call 	 ed 	 	the	water	bomb	base	.
 Air 	 bag 	 	 design 	 ers 	 	 al 	 so 	 	have	the	problem	of	 get 	 ting 	 	flat	 sheet 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	small	space	.
And	they	want	to	do	 the 	 ir 	 	design	by	 simul 	 ation 	 	.
So	they	need	to	figure	out	how	,	in	a	computer	,	to	flatten	an	airbag	.
And	the	 algorithm 	 s 	 	that	we	 develop 	 ed 	 	to	do	 insect 	 s 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	to	be	the	solution	for	 airbag 	 s 	 	to	do	 the 	 ir 	 	 simul 	 ation 	 	.
And	so	they	can	do	a	 simul 	 ation 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 T 	 hose 	 	are	the	origami	 crease 	 s 	 	 form 	 ing 	 	,	and	now	you	can	see	the	airbag	 infla 	 te 	 	and	find	out	,	 do 	 es 	 	it	work	?
And	that	 lead 	 s 	 	to	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	idea	.
You	know	,	where	did	these	 thing 	 s 	 	come	from	?
Well	,	the	heart	 s 	 tent 	 	came	from	that	little	 blow 	 - 	 up 	 	box	that	you	might	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	in	 element 	 ary 	 	school	.
It	's	the	same	pattern	,	 call 	 ed 	 	the	water	bomb	base	.
The	 airbag 	 - 	 flatten 	 ing 	 	algorithm	came	from	all	the	 develop 	 ments 	 	of	circle	 pack 	 ing 	 	and	the	 mathematic 	 al 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	that	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	just	to	create	 insect 	 s 	 	--	 thing 	 s 	 	with	 leg 	 s 	 	.
The	thing	is	,	that	 th 	 is 	 	often	 happen 	 s 	 	in	math	and	science	.
When	you	get	math	 involve 	 d 	 	,	 problem 	 s 	 	that	you	solve	for	aesthetic	value	 on 	 ly 	 	,	or	to	create	 some 	 thing 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	turn	around	and	turn	out	to	have	an	application	in	the	real	world	.
And	 a 	 s 	 	weird	and	surprising	 a 	 s 	 	it	may	sound	,	origami	may	 some 	 day 	 	even	 s 	 ave 	 	a	life	.
 Thank 	 s 	 	.

It	can	be	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	thing	,	the	ocean	.
And	it	can	be	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	thing	,	what	human	health	is	.
And	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	two	together	might	seem	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 daunt 	 ing 	 	task	,	but	what	I	'm	going	to	try	to	say	is	that	even	in	that	 complex 	 ity 	 	,	there	's	some	simple	 theme 	 s 	 	that	I	think	,	if	we	understand	,	we	can	 re 	 ally 	 	move	forward	.
And	 t 	 hose 	 	simple	 theme 	 s 	 	are	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	 theme 	 s 	 	about	the	complex	science	of	what	's	going	on	,	but	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	all	 pre 	 tty 	 	well	know	.
And	I	'm	going	to	start	with	 th 	 is 	 	one	:	If	 mom 	 ma 	 	ai	n't	happy	,	ai	n't	 no 	 body 	 	happy	.
We	know	that	,	right	?	We	've	 experience 	 d 	 	that	.
And	if	we	just	take	that	and	we	build	from	there	,	then	we	can	go	to	the	next	step	,	which	is	that	if	the	ocean	ai	n't	happy	,	ai	n't	 no 	 body 	 	happy	.
That	's	the	theme	of	my	talk	.
And	we	're	making	the	ocean	 pre 	 tty 	 	 un 	 happy 	 	in	a	lot	of	different	ways	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	shot	of	 Can 	 nery 	 	Row	in	1932	.
 Can 	 nery 	 	Row	,	at	the	time	,	had	the	 big 	 gest 	 	industrial	canning	operation	on	the	west	coast	.
We	 pil 	 ed 	 	enormous	 amount 	 s 	 	of	 poll 	 ution 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	air	and	 in 	 to 	 	the	water	.
 Ro 	 lf 	 	 Bo 	 lin 	 	,	who	was	a	professor	at	the	 Hop 	 kin 	 	's	Marine	 St 	 ation 	 	where	I	work	,	wrote	in	the	1940s	that	``	The	 fum 	 es 	 	from	the	 s 	 cum 	 	 float 	 ing 	 	on	the	 in 	 lets 	 	of	the	 ba 	 y 	 	 we 	 re 	 	so	bad	they	 turn 	 ed 	 	 lead 	 - 	 based 	 	 paint 	 s 	 	black	.

 The 	 y 	 	say	,	``	You	know	what	you	smell	?
You	smell	money	.	''
That	 poll 	 ution 	 	was	money	to	that	community	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	people	 deal 	 t 	 	with	the	 poll 	 ution 	 	and	 absorb 	 ed 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	skin	and	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	bodies	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 need 	 ed 	 	the	money	.
We	made	the	ocean	 un 	 happy 	 	;	we	made	people	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 happy 	 	,	and	we	made	them	 un 	 health 	 y 	 	.
The	 connect 	 ion 	 	between	ocean	health	and	human	health	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	based	 up 	 on 	 	 an 	 other 	 	couple	simple	 ad 	 age 	 s 	 	,	and	I	want	to	call	that	``	pinch	a	 min 	 now 	 	,	hurt	a	whale	.	''

 N 	 ow 	 	,	when	an	ecologist	 look 	 s 	 	at	the	ocean	--	I	have	to	tell	you	--	we	look	at	the	ocean	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	different	way	,	and	we	see	different	 thing 	 s 	 	than	when	a	regular	person	 look 	 s 	 	at	the	ocean	 be 	 cause 	 	when	an	ecologist	 look 	 s 	 	at	the	ocean	,	we	see	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 interconnect 	 ions 	 	.
We	see	the	base	of	the	food	chain	,	the	plankton	,	the	small	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	we	see	how	 t 	 hose 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	are	food	to	 animal 	 s 	 	in	the	middle	of	the	pyramid	,	and	on	so	up	 th 	 is 	 	 dia 	 gram 	 	.
And	that	flow	,	that	flow	of	life	,	from	the	 ver 	 y 	 	base	up	to	the	 ver 	 y 	 	top	,	is	the	flow	that	 ecologist 	 s 	 	see	.
And	that	's	what	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	preserve	when	we	say	,	``	 Sav 	 e 	 	the	ocean	.	 He 	 al 	 	the	ocean	.	''
It	's	that	pyramid	.
 N 	 ow 	 	why	 do 	 es 	 	that	matter	for	human	health	?
 Be 	 cause 	 	when	we	jam	 thing 	 s 	 	in	the	bottom	of	that	pyramid	that	should	n't	be	there	,	some	 ver 	 y 	 	 frighten 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	happen	.
 Poll 	 ut 	 ants 	 	,	some	 pollutant 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 create 	 d 	 	by	us	:	 molecule 	 s 	 	like	 PC 	 B 	 s 	 	that	ca	n't	be	broken	down	by	our	bodies	.
And	they	go	in	the	base	of	that	pyramid	,	and	they	drift	up	;	they	're	 pass 	 ed 	 	up	that	way	,	on	to	 predator 	 s 	 	and	on	to	the	top	 predator 	 s 	 	,	and	in	so	 do 	 ing 	 	,	they	 accumul 	 ate 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	to	 br 	 ing 	 	that	home	,	I	thought	I	'd	invent	a	little	game	.
We	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	have	to	play	it	;	we	can	just	think	about	it	here	.
It	's	the	 Styro 	 foam 	 	and	chocolate	game	.
 Imagin 	 e 	 	that	when	we	got	on	 th 	 is 	 	boat	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	all	 give 	 n 	 	two	 Styro 	 foam 	 	 peanut 	 s 	 	.
Ca	n't	do	much	with	them	:	Put	them	in	your	pocket	.
 Sup 	 pose 	 	the	 rule 	 s 	 	are	:	every	time	you	 off 	 er 	 	 some 	 body 	 	a	drink	,	you	give	them	the	drink	,	and	you	give	them	your	 Styro 	 foam 	 	 peanut 	 s 	 	too	.
What	'll	happen	is	that	the	 Styro 	 foam 	 	 peanut 	 s 	 	will	start	moving	through	our	 socie 	 ty 	 	here	,	and	they	will	 accumul 	 ate 	 	in	the	 drunk 	 est 	 	,	 s 	 ting 	 iest 	 	people	.
There	's	no	 mechan 	 ism 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	game	for	them	to	go	 any 	 where 	 	but	 in 	 to 	 	a	 big 	 ger 	 	and	 big 	 ger 	 	pile	of	 in 	 digest 	 ible 	 	 Styro 	 foam 	 	 peanut 	 s 	 	.
And	that	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	 happen 	 s 	 	with	 PD 	 B 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	food	pyramid	:	 The 	 y 	 	 accumul 	 ate 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	top	of	it	.
 N 	 ow 	 	suppose	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 Styro 	 foam 	 	 peanut 	 s 	 	,	we	take	these	 love 	 ly 	 	little	 chocolate 	 s 	 	that	we	get	and	we	had	 t 	 hose 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	.
Well	,	some	of	us	would	be	eating	 t 	 hose 	 	 chocolate 	 s 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 pass 	 ing 	 	them	around	,	and	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 accumul 	 ating 	 	,	they	will	just	pass	 in 	 to 	 	our	group	here	and	not	 accumul 	 ate 	 	in	any	one	group	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	 absorb 	 ed 	 	by	us	.
And	that	's	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	a	 PC 	 B 	 	and	,	say	,	 some 	 thing 	 	natural	like	an	 o 	 mega 	 - 	 3 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	we	want	out	of	the	marine	food	chain	.
 PC 	 B 	 s 	 	 accumul 	 ate 	 	.
We	have	great	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	that	,	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	.
 PC 	 B 	 s 	 	 accumul 	 ate 	 	in	 dolphin 	 s 	 	in	 Sara 	 s 	 ota 	 	Bay	,	in	Texas	,	in	North	 Caro 	 lina 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	get	 in 	 to 	 	the	food	chain	.
The	 dolphin 	 s 	 	eat	the	fish	that	have	 PC 	 B 	 s 	 	from	the	plankton	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	 PC 	 B 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 ing 	 	 fat 	 - 	 soluble 	 	,	 accumul 	 ate 	 	in	these	 dolphin 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	a	dolphin	,	mother	dolphin	,	any	dolphin	--	there	's	 on 	 ly 	 	one	way	that	a	 PC 	 B 	 	can	get	out	of	a	dolphin	.
And	what	's	that	?
In	mother	's	milk	.
 He 	 re 	 	's	a	 dia 	 gram 	 	of	the	 PC 	 B 	 	load	of	 dolphin 	 s 	 	in	 Sara 	 s 	 ota 	 	Bay	.
Adult	 male 	 s 	 	:	a	huge	load	.
 Ju 	 ve 	 ni 	 les 	 	:	a	huge	load	.
 Fe 	 male 	 s 	 	after	 the 	 ir 	 	first	 ca 	 lf 	 	is	 al 	 ready 	 	 wean 	 ed 	 	:	a	lower	load	.
 T 	 hose 	 	 female 	 s 	 	,	they	're	not	 try 	 ing 	 	to	.
 T 	 hose 	 	 female 	 s 	 	are	 pass 	 ing 	 	the	 PC 	 B 	 s 	 	in	the	fat	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	mother	's	milk	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 off 	 spring 	 	,	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 off 	 spring 	 	do	n't	 surviv 	 e 	 	.
The	death	rate	in	these	 dolphin 	 s 	 	,	for	the	first	 ca 	 lf 	 	born	of	every	female	dolphin	,	is	60	to	80	percent	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	 mother 	 s 	 	pump	 the 	 ir 	 	first	 off 	 spring 	 	full	of	 th 	 is 	 	pollutant	,	and	most	of	them	die	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	the	mother	then	can	go	and	 re 	 produce 	 	,	but	what	a	 terr 	 ible 	 	price	to	pay	for	the	 accumul 	 ation 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	pollutant	in	these	 animal 	 s 	 	--	the	death	of	the	 first 	 - 	 born 	 	 ca 	 lf 	 	.
There	's	 an 	 other 	 	top	predator	in	the	ocean	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	.
That	top	predator	,	of	course	,	is	us	.
And	we	 al 	 so 	 	are	eating	meat	that	 come 	 s 	 	from	some	of	these	same	 place 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	whale	meat	that	I	 photograph 	 ed 	 	in	a	 grocer 	 y 	 	store	in	 To 	 kyo 	 	--	or	is	it	?
In	fact	,	what	we	did	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	was	learn	how	to	smuggle	a	 mole 	 cular 	 	biology	lab	 in 	 to 	 	 To 	 kyo 	 	and	use	it	to	 genetic 	 ally 	 	test	the	DNA	out	of	whale	meat	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	and	identify	what	they	 re 	 ally 	 	 we 	 re 	 	.
And	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	whale	meat	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	whale	meat	.
Some	of	them	 we 	 re 	 	 il 	 legal 	 	whale	meat	,	by	the	way	.
That	's	 an 	 other 	 	story	.
But	some	of	them	 we 	 re 	 	not	whale	meat	at	all	.
Even	 th 	 ough 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 label 	 ed 	 	whale	meat	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	dolphin	meat	.
Some	of	them	 we 	 re 	 	dolphin	liver	.	Some	of	them	 we 	 re 	 	dolphin	 blu 	 b 	 ber 	 	.
And	 t 	 hose 	 	dolphin	 part 	 s 	 	had	a	huge	load	of	 PC 	 B 	 s 	 	,	 dioxin 	 s 	 	and	heavy	 metal 	 s 	 	.
And	that	huge	load	was	 pass 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	people	that	ate	 th 	 is 	 	meat	.
It	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	a	lot	of	 dolphin 	 s 	 	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 s 	 old 	 	 a 	 s 	 	meat	in	the	whale	meat	market	around	the	world	.
That	's	a	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	for	 t 	 hose 	 	 population 	 s 	 	,	but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	for	the	people	eating	them	 be 	 cause 	 	they	do	n't	know	that	that	's	toxic	meat	.
We	had	these	data	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
I	remember	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	at	my	desk	 be 	 ing 	 	about	the	 on 	 ly 	 	person	in	the	world	who	 k 	 new 	 	that	whale	meat	 be 	 ing 	 	 s 	 old 	 	in	these	 market 	 s 	 	was	 re 	 ally 	 	dolphin	meat	,	and	it	was	toxic	.
It	had	 two 	 - 	 to 	 - 	 three 	 - 	 to 	 - 	 400 	 	 time 	 s 	 	the	toxic	 load 	 s 	 	ever	 allow 	 ed 	 	by	the	 E 	 PA 	 	.
And	I	remember	there	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	at	my	desk	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	Well	,	I	know	 th 	 is 	 	.	 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	great	scientific	 discover 	 y 	 	,	''	but	it	was	so	awful	.
And	for	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	time	in	my	scientific	 care 	 er 	 	,	I	broke	scientific	 proto 	 col 	 	,	which	is	that	you	take	the	data	and	publish	them	in	scientific	 journal 	 s 	 	and	then	begin	to	talk	about	them	.
We	 s 	 ent 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	polite	letter	to	the	 Mini 	 ster 	 	of	Health	in	Japan	and	 simpl 	 y 	 	 point 	 ed 	 	out	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 in 	 toler 	 able 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	,	not	for	us	,	but	for	the	people	of	Japan	 be 	 cause 	 	 mother 	 s 	 	who	may	be	 breast 	 feed 	 ing 	 	,	who	may	have	young	children	,	would	be	 buy 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	they	thought	was	 health 	 y 	 	,	but	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	toxic	.
That	led	to	a	whole	 s 	 eries 	 	of	other	 campaign 	 s 	 	in	Japan	,	and	I	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	proud	to	say	that	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	to	buy	 any 	 thing 	 	in	Japan	that	's	 label 	 ed 	 	 in 	 correct 	 ly 	 	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	they	're	still	selling	whale	meat	,	which	I	 believ 	 e 	 	they	should	n't	.
But	at	 l 	 east 	 	it	's	 label 	 ed 	 	 correct 	 ly 	 	,	and	you	're	no	 long 	 er 	 	going	to	be	 buy 	 ing 	 	toxic	dolphin	meat	 in 	 stead 	 	.
It	is	n't	just	there	that	 th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	,	but	in	a	natural	diet	of	some	 commun 	 ities 	 	in	the	Canadian	 arc 	 tic 	 	and	in	the	 Unit 	 ed 	 	 Stat 	 es 	 	and	in	the	European	 arc 	 tic 	 	,	a	natural	diet	of	 seal 	 s 	 	and	 whale 	 s 	 	 lead 	 s 	 	to	an	 accumul 	 ation 	 	of	 PC 	 B 	 s 	 	that	have	 gather 	 ed 	 	up	from	all	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	world	and	 end 	 ed 	 	up	in	these	women	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	women	have	toxic	breast	milk	.
 The 	 y 	 	can	not	feed	 the 	 ir 	 	 off 	 spring 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	children	,	 the 	 ir 	 	breast	milk	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 accumul 	 ation 	 	of	these	 toxin 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	food	chain	,	in	 the 	 ir 	 	part	of	the	world	's	ocean	pyramid	.
That	 mean 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 immun 	 e 	 	 system 	 s 	 	are	 com 	 promise 	 d 	 	.
It	 mean 	 s 	 	that	 the 	 ir 	 	children	's	 develop 	 ment 	 	can	be	 com 	 promise 	 d 	 	.
And	the	world	's	attention	on	 th 	 is 	 	over	the	last	decade	 ha 	 s 	 	 reduc 	 ed 	 	the	problem	for	these	women	,	not	by	changing	the	pyramid	,	but	by	changing	what	they	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	eat	out	of	it	.
We	've	taken	them	out	of	 the 	 ir 	 	natural	pyramid	in	order	to	solve	 th 	 is 	 	problem	.
That	's	a	good	thing	for	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	 a 	 cute 	 	problem	,	but	it	 do 	 es 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	solve	the	pyramid	problem	.
There	's	other	ways	of	 break 	 ing 	 	the	pyramid	.
The	pyramid	,	if	we	jam	 thing 	 s 	 	in	the	bottom	,	can	get	 back 	 ed 	 	up	like	a	 sew 	 er 	 	line	that	's	 clog 	 ged 	 	.
And	if	we	jam	 nutrient 	 s 	 	,	 sew 	 age 	 	,	 fertil 	 izer 	 	in	the	base	of	that	food	pyramid	,	it	can	back	up	all	through	it	.
We	end	up	with	 thing 	 s 	 	we	've	heard	about	before	:	red	 tide 	 s 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	which	are	 bloom 	 s 	 	of	toxic	 al 	 ga 	 e 	 	 float 	 ing 	 	through	the	 ocean 	 s 	 	 caus 	 ing 	 	 neuro 	 logical 	 	damage	.
We	can	 al 	 so 	 	see	 bloom 	 s 	 	of	bacteria	,	 bloom 	 s 	 	of	viruses	in	the	ocean	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	two	 shot 	 s 	 	of	a	red	tide	coming	on	shore	here	and	a	bacteria	in	the	 gen 	 us 	 	vibrio	,	which	 include 	 s 	 	the	 gen 	 us 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	cholera	in	it	.
How	 man 	 y 	 	people	have	 s 	 een 	 	a	``	beach	closed	''	sign	?
Why	 do 	 es 	 	that	happen	?
It	 happen 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	 jamm 	 ed 	 	so	much	 in 	 to 	 	the	base	of	the	natural	ocean	pyramid	that	these	bacteria	clog	it	up	and	 over 	 fill 	 	onto	our	 beach 	 es 	 	.
 Of 	 ten 	 	what	 jam 	 s 	 	us	up	is	 sew 	 age 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	have	ever	gone	to	a	state	park	or	a	national	park	where	you	had	a	big	sign	at	the	front	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	 C 	 lose 	 d 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	human	 sew 	 age 	 	is	so	far	over	 th 	 is 	 	park	that	you	ca	n't	use	it	''	?
Not	 ver 	 y 	 	often	.	We	would	n't	 toler 	 ate 	 	that	.
We	would	n't	 toler 	 ate 	 	our	 park 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 swamp 	 ed 	 	by	human	 sew 	 age 	 	,	but	 beach 	 es 	 	are	closed	a	lot	in	our	country	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	closed	more	and	more	and	more	all	around	the	world	for	the	same	reason	,	and	I	 believ 	 e 	 	we	should	n't	 toler 	 ate 	 	that	either	.
It	's	not	just	a	question	of	 clean 	 lines 	 s 	 	;	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	question	of	how	 t 	 hose 	 	 organism 	 s 	 	then	turn	 in 	 to 	 	human	disease	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	 vibrio 	 s 	 	,	these	bacteria	,	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	infect	people	.
 The 	 y 	 	can	go	 in 	 to 	 	your	skin	and	create	skin	 infect 	 ions 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	graph	from	 NO 	 AA 	 	's	ocean	and	human	health	 initi 	 ative 	 	,	 show 	 ing 	 	the	rise	of	the	 infect 	 ions 	 	by	vibrio	in	people	over	the	last	few	 year 	 s 	 	.
 Sur 	 fer 	 s 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	know	 th 	 is 	 	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	.
And	if	you	can	see	on	some	surfing	 s 	 ites 	 	,	in	fact	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	do	you	see	what	the	 wave 	 s 	 	are	like	or	what	the	weather	's	like	,	but	on	some	surf	rider	 s 	 ites 	 	,	you	see	a	little	 flash 	 ing 	 	poo	alert	.
That	 mean 	 s 	 	that	the	beach	might	have	great	 wave 	 s 	 	,	but	it	's	a	 danger 	 ous 	 	place	for	 surf 	 ers 	 	to	be	 be 	 cause 	 	they	can	carry	with	them	,	even	after	a	great	day	of	surfing	,	 th 	 is 	 	 leg 	 acy 	 	of	an	 infect 	 ion 	 	that	might	take	a	 ver 	 y 	 	long	time	to	solve	.
Some	of	these	 infect 	 ions 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 carry 	 ing 	 	 anti 	 biotic 	 	 resist 	 ance 	 	 gene 	 s 	 	now	,	and	that	 make 	 s 	 	them	even	more	difficult	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	same	 infect 	 ions 	 	create	 harm 	 ful 	 	 al 	 gal 	 	 bloom 	 s 	 	.
 T 	 hose 	 	 bloom 	 s 	 	are	generating	other	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 chemical 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	just	a	simple	list	of	some	of	the	 type 	 s 	 	of	 poison 	 s 	 	that	come	out	of	these	 harm 	 ful 	 	 al 	 gal 	 	 bloom 	 s 	 	:	 shell 	 fish 	 	 poison 	 ing 	 	,	fish	 ci 	 gua 	 tera 	 	,	diarrheic	 shell 	 fish 	 	 poison 	 ing 	 	--	you	do	n't	want	to	know	about	that	--	 neuro 	 toxic 	 	 shell 	 fish 	 	 poison 	 ing 	 	,	 para 	 ly 	 tic 	 	 shell 	 fish 	 	 poison 	 ing 	 	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 get 	 ting 	 	 in 	 to 	 	our	food	chain	 be 	 cause 	 	of	these	 bloom 	 s 	 	.

 Cope 	 pods 	 	are	small	 crustacean 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	a	 tin 	 y 	 	fraction	of	an	inch	long	,	and	they	can	carry	on	 the 	 ir 	 	little	 leg 	 s 	 	some	of	the	cholera	bacteria	that	then	 lead 	 s 	 	to	human	disease	.

So	what	do	you	do	?
We	have	major	 problem 	 s 	 	in	 disrupt 	 ed 	 	 eco 	 system 	 	flow	that	the	pyramid	may	not	be	 work 	 ing 	 	so	well	,	that	the	flow	from	the	base	up	 in 	 to 	 	it	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 block 	 ed 	 	and	 clog 	 ged 	 	.
What	do	you	do	when	you	have	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	 disrupt 	 ed 	 	flow	?
Well	,	there	's	a	bunch	of	 thing 	 s 	 	you	could	do	.
You	could	call	 Jo 	 e 	 	the	 P 	 lumber 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
And	he	could	come	in	and	fix	the	flow	.
But	in	fact	,	if	you	look	around	the	world	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	are	there	hope	 spot 	 s 	 	for	where	we	may	be	able	to	fix	 problem 	 s 	 	,	there	have	 be 	 en 	 	 place 	 s 	 	where	 problem 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 fix 	 ed 	 	,	where	people	have	come	to	 grip 	 s 	 	with	these	 issue 	 s 	 	and	 beg 	 un 	 	to	turn	them	around	.

I	 start 	 ed 	 	out	 show 	 ing 	 	how	much	we	had	 di 	 stress 	 ed 	 	the	 Monte 	 re 	 y 	 	Bay	 eco 	 system 	 	with	 poll 	 ution 	 	and	the	canning	industry	and	all	of	the	 attend 	 ant 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	.
In	1932	,	that	's	the	picture	.
In	2009	,	the	picture	is	 dramat 	 ically 	 	different	.
The	 can 	 n 	 eries 	 	are	gone	.	The	 poll 	 ution 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 ab 	 ated 	 	.
But	there	's	a	 great 	 er 	 	sense	here	that	what	the	individual	 commun 	 ities 	 	need	is	 work 	 ing 	 	 eco 	 system 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	need	a	 function 	 ing 	 	pyramid	from	the	base	all	the	way	to	the	top	.
And	that	pyramid	in	 Monte 	 re 	 y 	 	,	right	now	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 effort 	 s 	 	of	a	lot	of	different	people	,	is	 function 	 ing 	 	better	than	it	's	ever	 function 	 ed 	 	for	the	last	150	 year 	 s 	 	.
It	did	n't	happen	 accident 	 ally 	 	.
It	 happen 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 man 	 y 	 	people	put	 the 	 ir 	 	time	and	effort	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 pioneer 	 ing 	 	spirit	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
On	the	left	there	,	Julia	Platt	,	the	mayor	of	my	little	 home 	 town 	 	in	Pacific	Grove	.
At	74	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	 be 	 came 	 	mayor	 be 	 cause 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	had	to	be	 d 	 one 	 	to	protect	the	ocean	.
In	1931	,	she	 produce 	 d 	 	California	's	first	 community 	 - 	 based 	 	marine	 protect 	 ed 	 	area	,	right	next	to	the	 big 	 gest 	 	polluting	 can 	 nery 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	Julia	 k 	 new 	 	that	when	the	 can 	 n 	 eries 	 	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	 we 	 re 	 	gone	,	the	ocean	 need 	 ed 	 	a	place	to	grow	from	,	that	the	ocean	 need 	 ed 	 	a	place	to	spark	a	seed	,	and	she	 want 	 ed 	 	to	provide	that	seed	.
Other	people	,	like	 D 	 avid 	 	 Pack 	 ard 	 	and	 Ju 	 lie 	 	 Pack 	 ard 	 	,	who	 we 	 re 	 	 instrument 	 al 	 	in	producing	the	 Monte 	 re 	 y 	 	Bay	 aqua 	 rium 	 	to	lock	 in 	 to 	 	people	's	 not 	 ion 	 	that	the	ocean	and	the	health	of	the	ocean	 eco 	 system 	 	 we 	 re 	 	just	 a 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	area	 a 	 s 	 	eating	the	 eco 	 system 	 	would	be	.
That	change	in	 think 	 ing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	led	to	a	 dramat 	 ic 	 	shift	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	in	the	 fortune 	 s 	 	of	 Monte 	 re 	 y 	 	Bay	,	but	other	 place 	 s 	 	around	the	world	.
Well	,	I	want	to	 leav 	 e 	 	you	with	the	thought	that	what	we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	here	is	protect	 th 	 is 	 	ocean	pyramid	,	and	that	ocean	pyramid	 connect 	 s 	 	to	our	own	pyramid	of	life	.
It	's	an	ocean	planet	,	and	we	think	of	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	terrestrial	species	,	but	the	pyramid	of	life	in	the	ocean	and	our	own	 live 	 s 	 	on	land	are	 intric 	 ate 	 ly 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	.
And	it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	through	 hav 	 ing 	 	the	ocean	 be 	 ing 	 	 health 	 y 	 	that	we	can	remain	 health 	 y 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.

 J 	 essa 	 	 Gam 	 ble 	 	:	Our	natural	sleep	cycle
Let	's	start	with	day	and	night	.
Life	 evolv 	 ed 	 	under	 condition 	 s 	 	of	light	and	 dark 	 ness 	 	,	light	and	then	 dark 	 ness 	 	.
And	so	 plant 	 s 	 	and	 animal 	 s 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	internal	 clock 	 s 	 	so	that	they	would	be	ready	for	these	 change 	 s 	 	in	light	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	chemical	 clock 	 s 	 	,	and	they	're	found	in	every	known	 be 	 ing 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	two	or	more	 cell 	 s 	 	and	in	some	that	 on 	 ly 	 	have	one	cell	.
I	'll	give	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	--	if	you	take	a	 horse 	 shoe 	 	crab	off	the	beach	,	and	you	fly	it	all	the	way	 a 	 cross 	 	the	continent	,	and	you	drop	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	 slop 	 ed 	 	cage	,	it	will	scramble	up	the	floor	of	the	cage	 a 	 s 	 	the	tide	is	 ris 	 ing 	 	on	 it 	 s 	 	home	 shore 	 s 	 	,	and	it	'll	 s 	 kit 	 ter 	 	down	 aga 	 in 	 	right	 a 	 s 	 	the	water	is	 reced 	 ing 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 mile 	 s 	 	away	.
It	'll	do	 th 	 is 	 	for	 week 	 s 	 	,	 un 	 til 	 	it	kind	of	 gradu 	 ally 	 	 lose 	 s 	 	the	plot	.
And	it	's	 in 	 credible 	 	to	watch	,	but	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	 psych 	 ic 	 	or	 para 	 normal 	 	going	on	;	it	's	 simpl 	 y 	 	that	these	 crab 	 s 	 	have	internal	 cycle 	 s 	 	that	correspond	,	 usual 	 ly 	 	,	with	what	's	going	on	around	it	.
So	,	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	ability	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
And	in	 human 	 s 	 	,	we	call	it	the	``	body	clock	.	''
You	can	see	 th 	 is 	 	most	 clear 	 ly 	 	when	you	take	away	 some 	 one 	 	's	watch	and	you	shut	them	 in 	 to 	 	a	 bunk 	 er 	 	,	deep	 under 	 ground 	 	,	for	a	couple	of	 month 	 s 	 	.
People	 actual 	 ly 	 	volunteer	for	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	they	 usual 	 ly 	 	come	out	kind	of	 r 	 av 	 ing 	 	about	 the 	 ir 	 	productive	time	in	the	hole	.
So	,	no	matter	how	 a 	 typical 	 	these	 subject 	 s 	 	would	have	to	be	,	they	all	show	the	same	thing	.
 The 	 y 	 	get	up	just	a	little	bit	 lat 	 er 	 	every	day	--	say	15	 minute 	 s 	 	or	so	--	and	they	kind	of	drift	all	the	way	around	the	clock	like	 th 	 is 	 	over	the	course	of	the	 week 	 s 	 	.
And	so	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	we	know	that	they	are	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	internal	 clock 	 s 	 	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 some 	 how 	 	 sens 	 ing 	 	the	day	 out 	 side 	 	.
So	fine	,	we	have	a	body	clock	,	and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	it	's	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	in	our	 live 	 s 	 	.
It	's	a	huge	driver	for	culture	and	I	think	that	it	's	the	most	 under 	 rated 	 	force	on	our	behavior	.
We	 evolv 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	species	near	the	 equ 	 ator 	 	,	and	so	we	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 well 	 - 	 equi 	 pped 	 	to	deal	with	12	 hour 	 s 	 	of	 day 	 light 	 	and	12	 hour 	 s 	 	of	 dark 	 ness 	 	.
But	of	course	,	we	've	spread	to	every	corner	of	the	 glob 	 e 	 	and	in	 Arc 	 tic 	 	Canada	,	where	I	live	,	we	have	 perpetu 	 al 	 	 day 	 light 	 	in	summer	and	24	 hour 	 s 	 	of	 dark 	 ness 	 	in	winter	.
So	the	culture	,	the	 north 	 ern 	 	 ab 	 original 	 	culture	,	 tradition 	 ally 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 high 	 ly 	 	 season 	 al 	 	.
In	winter	,	there	's	a	lot	of	 sleep 	 ing 	 	going	on	;	you	enjoy	your	family	life	 in 	 side 	 	.
And	in	summer	,	it	's	 al 	 most 	 	 man 	 ic 	 	 hunt 	 ing 	 	and	 work 	 ing 	 	activity	 ver 	 y 	 	long	 hour 	 s 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	active	.
So	,	what	would	our	natural	rhythm	look	like	?
What	would	our	 sleep 	 ing 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	be	in	the	sort	of	ideal	sense	?
Well	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	when	people	are	living	 with 	 out 	 	any	sort	of	artificial	light	at	all	,	they	sleep	twice	every	night	.
 The 	 y 	 	go	to	bed	around	8:00	p.m	.
 un 	 til 	 	 mid 	 night 	 	and	then	 aga 	 in 	 	,	they	sleep	from	about	2:00	 a.m 	 . 	 	 un 	 til 	 	 s 	 un 	 rise 	 	.
And	 in 	 - 	 between 	 	,	they	have	a	couple	of	 hour 	 s 	 	of	sort	of	 medit 	 ative 	 	quiet	in	bed	.
And	 dur 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	time	,	there	's	a	 s 	 urge 	 	of	 pro 	 lac 	 tin 	 	,	the	 like 	 s 	 	of	which	a	modern	day	never	 s 	 ees 	 	.
The	people	in	these	 stud 	 ies 	 	report	 feel 	 ing 	 	so	awake	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	 day 	 time 	 	,	that	they	 real 	 ize 	 	they	're	 ex 	 peri 	 encing 	 	true	 wake 	 fulness 	 	for	the	first	time	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
So	,	cut	to	the	modern	day	.
We	're	living	in	a	culture	of	jet	lag	,	global	travel	,	24-hour	business	,	shift	work	.
And	you	know	,	our	modern	ways	of	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	have	 the 	 ir 	 	 advantage 	 s 	 	,	but	I	 believ 	 e 	 	we	should	understand	the	 cost 	 s 	 	.
Thank	you	.

 Mi 	 ha 	 ly 	 	Csikszentmihalyi	on	flow
I	grew	up	in	 Euro 	 pe 	 	,	and	World	War	 I 	 I 	 	caught	me	when	I	was	between	seven	and	10	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
And	I	 real 	 ized 	 	how	few	of	the	 grown 	 - 	 up 	 s 	 	that	I	 k 	 new 	 	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	 with 	 stand 	 	the	 tra 	 ged 	 ies 	 	that	the	war	 visit 	 ed 	 	on	them	--	how	few	of	them	could	even	resemble	a	normal	,	 content 	 ed 	 	,	satisfied	,	happy	life	once	 the 	 ir 	 	job	,	 the 	 ir 	 	home	,	 the 	 ir 	 	security	was	 destroy 	 ed 	 	by	the	war	.
So	I	 be 	 came 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 understand 	 ing 	 	what	 con 	 tribute 	 d 	 	to	a	life	that	was	worth	living	.
And	I	 tri 	 ed 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	child	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	teenager	,	to	read	 philosoph 	 y 	 	and	to	get	 involve 	 d 	 	in	art	and	 relig 	 ion 	 	and	 man 	 y 	 	other	ways	that	I	could	see	 a 	 s 	 	a	possible	answer	to	that	question	.
And	 final 	 ly 	 	I	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 en 	 counter 	 ing 	 	 psycho 	 logy 	 	by	chance	.
I	was	at	a	ski	resort	in	 Switzer 	 land 	 	 with 	 out 	 	any	money	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	enjoy	 my 	 self 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	snow	had	 melt 	 ed 	 	and	I	did	n't	have	money	to	go	to	a	movie	.	But	I	found	that	on	the	--	I	read	in	the	 news 	 paper 	 s 	 	that	there	was	to	be	a	 present 	 ation 	 	by	 some 	 one 	 	in	a	place	that	I	'd	 s 	 een 	 	in	the	center	of	Zurich	,	and	it	was	about	 fly 	 ing 	 	 saucer 	 s 	 	[	that	]	he	was	going	to	talk	.
And	I	thought	,	well	,	since	I	ca	n't	go	to	the	 movie 	 s 	 	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	I	will	go	for	free	to	listen	to	 fly 	 ing 	 	 saucer 	 s 	 	.
And	the	man	who	 talk 	 ed 	 	at	that	 even 	 ing 	 	 lectur 	 e 	 	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
 In 	 stead 	 	of	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	little	green	men	,	he	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	how	the	 psych 	 e 	 	of	the	 European 	 s 	 	had	 be 	 en 	 	 trauma 	 t 	 ized 	 	by	the	war	,	and	now	they	're	 project 	 ing 	 	 fly 	 ing 	 	 saucer 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	sky	.
He	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	how	the	 man 	 d 	 ala 	 s 	 	of	ancient	Hindu	 relig 	 ion 	 	 we 	 re 	 	kind	of	 project 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	sky	 a 	 s 	 	an	attempt	to	regain	some	sense	of	order	after	the	 cha 	 os 	 	of	war	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	 seem 	 ed 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	to	me	.
And	I	 start 	 ed 	 	 read 	 ing 	 	his	 book 	 s 	 	after	that	 lectur 	 e 	 	.
And	that	was	Carl	Jung	,	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	name	or	work	I	had	no	idea	about	.
 Th 	 en 	 	I	came	to	 th 	 is 	 	country	to	 stud 	 y 	 	 psycho 	 logy 	 	and	I	 start 	 ed 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	the	 root 	 s 	 	of	happiness	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	typical	result	that	 man 	 y 	 	people	have	 present 	 ed 	 	,	and	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 vari 	 ations 	 	on	it	.
But	 th 	 is 	 	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	 show 	 s 	 	that	about	30	percent	of	the	people	 survey 	 ed 	 	in	the	 Unit 	 ed 	 	 Stat 	 es 	 	since	1956	say	that	 the 	 ir 	 	life	is	 ver 	 y 	 	happy	.
And	that	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 change 	 d 	 	at	all	.
 Where 	 a 	 s 	 	the	personal	income	,	on	a	scale	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	held	constant	to	 accommo 	 date 	 	for	 infla 	 tion 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	more	than	 double 	 d 	 	,	 al 	 most 	 	 triple 	 d 	 	,	in	that	period	.
But	you	find	 essential 	 ly 	 	the	same	 result 	 s 	 	,	 name 	 ly 	 	,	that	after	a	certain	 bas 	 ic 	 	point	--	which	 correspond 	 s 	 	more	or	less	to	just	a	few	1,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	above	the	 minim 	 um 	 	poverty	level	--	 in 	 crease 	 s 	 	in	material	 well 	 - 	 be 	 ing 	 	do	n't	seem	to	affect	how	happy	people	are	.
In	fact	,	you	can	find	that	the	lack	of	 bas 	 ic 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	,	material	 resource 	 s 	 	,	 con 	 tribute 	 s 	 	to	 un 	 happiness 	 	,	but	the	 in 	 crease 	 	in	material	 resource 	 s 	 	 do 	 es 	 	not	 in 	 crease 	 	happiness	.
So	my	research	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	focused	more	on	--	after	 find 	 ing 	 	out	these	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 correspond 	 ed 	 	to	my	own	experience	,	I	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	understand	:	where	--	in	 every 	 day 	 	life	,	in	our	normal	experience	--	do	we	feel	 re 	 ally 	 	happy	?
And	to	start	 t 	 hose 	 	 stud 	 ies 	 	about	40	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	I	 beg 	 an 	 	to	look	at	creative	people	--	first	 artist 	 s 	 	and	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	and	so	forth	--	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	what	made	them	feel	that	it	was	worth	 essential 	 ly 	 	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	life	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	for	which	 man 	 y 	 	of	them	did	n't	expect	either	fame	or	fortune	,	but	which	made	 the 	 ir 	 	life	 meaning 	 ful 	 	and	worth	 do 	 ing 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	was	one	of	the	 lead 	 ing 	 	 compose 	 rs 	 	of	American	music	back	in	the	'70s	.
And	the	interview	was	40	 page 	 s 	 	long	.
But	 th 	 is 	 	little	excerpt	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 summ 	 ary 	 	of	what	he	was	 say 	 ing 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	interview	.
And	it	 de 	 scribe 	 s 	 	how	he	 feel 	 s 	 	when	 com 	 posing 	 	is	going	well	.
And	he	 say 	 s 	 	by	 de 	 s 	 crib 	 ing 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	an	 ec 	 static 	 	state	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	``	 ecstas 	 y 	 	''	in	Greek	 me 	 ant 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	to	stand	to	the	side	of	 some 	 thing 	 	.
And	then	it	 be 	 came 	 	 essential 	 ly 	 	an	 analog 	 y 	 	for	a	mental	state	where	you	feel	that	you	are	not	 do 	 ing 	 	your	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 every 	 day 	 	 routine 	 s 	 	.
So	 ecstas 	 y 	 	is	 essential 	 ly 	 	a	 step 	 ping 	 	 in 	 to 	 	an	 alter 	 native 	 	 re 	 ality 	 	.
And	it	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	if	you	think	about	it	,	how	,	when	we	think	about	the	 civil 	 ization 	 s 	 	that	we	look	up	to	 a 	 s 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 pinnacle 	 s 	 	of	human	 achiev 	 ement 	 	--	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	China	,	Greece	,	the	Hindu	 civil 	 ization 	 	,	or	the	 Maya 	 s 	 	,	or	 Egyptian 	 s 	 	--	what	we	know	about	them	is	 re 	 ally 	 	about	 the 	 ir 	 	 ecstas 	 ies 	 	,	not	about	 the 	 ir 	 	 every 	 day 	 	life	.
We	know	the	 temple 	 s 	 	they	built	,	where	people	could	come	to	experience	a	different	 re 	 ality 	 	.
We	know	about	the	 circus 	 es 	 	,	the	 arena 	 s 	 	,	the	 theater 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	the	 remain 	 s 	 	of	 civil 	 ization 	 s 	 	and	they	are	the	 place 	 s 	 	that	people	went	to	experience	life	in	a	more	 concent 	 rated 	 	,	more	 order 	 ed 	 	form	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	man	 do 	 es 	 	n't	need	to	go	to	a	place	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	which	is	 al 	 so 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	place	,	 th 	 is 	 	arena	,	which	is	built	like	a	Greek	 amphi 	 theatre 	 	,	is	a	place	for	 ecstas 	 y 	 	 al 	 so 	 	.
We	are	 particip 	 ating 	 	in	a	 re 	 ality 	 	that	is	different	from	that	of	the	 every 	 day 	 	life	that	we	're	used	to	.
But	 th 	 is 	 	man	 do 	 es 	 	n't	need	to	go	there	.
He	 need 	 s 	 	just	a	piece	of	paper	where	he	can	put	down	little	 mark 	 s 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	he	 do 	 es 	 	that	,	he	can	imagine	 sound 	 s 	 	that	had	not	 exist 	 ed 	 	before	in	that	 part 	 icular 	 	combination	.
So	once	he	 get 	 s 	 	to	that	point	of	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	create	,	like	 Jenn 	 ifer 	 	did	in	her	improvisation	,	a	new	 re 	 ality 	 	--	that	is	,	a	moment	of	 ecstas 	 y 	 	--	he	 enter 	 s 	 	that	different	 re 	 ality 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	he	 say 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	so	 intens 	 e 	 	an	experience	that	it	 feel 	 s 	 	 al 	 most 	 	 a 	 s 	 	if	he	did	n't	exist	.
And	that	 sound 	 s 	 	like	a	kind	of	a	romantic	 exagge 	 ration 	 	.
But	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	our	nervous	system	is	 in 	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 process 	 ing 	 	more	than	about	110	bits	of	information	per	second	.
And	in	order	to	hear	me	and	understand	what	I	'm	 say 	 ing 	 	,	you	need	to	process	about	60	bits	per	second	.
That	's	why	you	ca	n't	hear	more	than	two	people	.
You	ca	n't	understand	more	than	two	people	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	you	.
Well	,	when	you	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	 engag 	 ing 	 	process	of	creating	 some 	 thing 	 	new	,	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	man	is	,	he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	 en 	 ough 	 	attention	left	over	to	monitor	how	his	body	 feel 	 s 	 	,	or	his	 problem 	 s 	 	at	home	.
He	ca	n't	feel	even	that	he	's	 hung 	 ry 	 	or	 tire 	 d 	 	.
 Hi 	 s 	 	body	 disappear 	 s 	 	,	his	 ident 	 ity 	 	 disappear 	 s 	 	from	his	 conscious 	 ness 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	 en 	 ough 	 	attention	,	like	 non 	 e 	 	of	us	do	,	to	 re 	 ally 	 	do	well	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 requir 	 es 	 	a	lot	of	 concent 	 ration 	 	,	and	at	the	same	time	to	feel	that	he	 exist 	 s 	 	.
So	 exist 	 ence 	 	is	 tempor 	 arily 	 	 suspend 	 ed 	 	.
And	he	 say 	 s 	 	that	his	hand	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	moving	by	 it 	 self 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	I	could	look	at	my	hand	for	two	 week 	 s 	 	,	and	I	would	n't	feel	any	awe	or	wonder	,	 be 	 cause 	 	I	ca	n't	compose	.
So	what	it	's	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	here	is	that	 obvious 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 autom 	 atic 	 	,	 spontane 	 ous 	 	process	that	he	's	 de 	 s 	 crib 	 ing 	 	can	 on 	 ly 	 	happen	to	 some 	 one 	 	who	is	 ver 	 y 	 	well	trained	and	who	 ha 	 s 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	 techni 	 que 	 	.
And	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	a	kind	of	a	truism	in	the	 stud 	 y 	 	of	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	that	you	ca	n't	be	creating	 any 	 thing 	 	with	less	than	10	 year 	 s 	 	of	 technical 	 - 	 knowledge 	 	 immers 	 ion 	 	in	a	 part 	 icular 	 	field	.
 W 	 he 	 ther 	 	it	's	 mathematic 	 s 	 	or	music	,	it	 take 	 s 	 	that	long	to	be	able	to	begin	to	change	 some 	 thing 	 	in	a	way	that	it	's	better	than	what	was	there	before	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	when	that	 happen 	 s 	 	,	he	 say 	 s 	 	the	music	just	 flow 	 s 	 	out	.
And	 be 	 cause 	 	all	of	these	people	I	 start 	 ed 	 	 interview 	 ing 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	was	an	interview	which	is	over	30	 year 	 s 	 	old	--	so	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	people	 de 	 scribed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 spontane 	 ous 	 	flow	that	I	 call 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	type	of	experience	the	``	flow	experience	.	''
And	it	 happen 	 s 	 	in	different	 realm 	 s 	 	.
For	 in 	 stance 	 	,	a	poet	 de 	 scribe 	 s 	 	it	in	 th 	 is 	 	form	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	by	a	student	of	mine	who	 interview 	 ed 	 	some	of	the	 lead 	 ing 	 	 writer 	 s 	 	and	 poet 	 s 	 	in	the	 Unit 	 ed 	 	 Stat 	 es 	 	.
And	it	 de 	 scribe 	 s 	 	the	same	 effort 	 less 	 	,	 spontane 	 ous 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	that	you	get	when	you	enter	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 ec 	 static 	 	state	.
 Th 	 is 	 	poet	 de 	 scribe 	 s 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	 open 	 ing 	 	a	door	that	 float 	 s 	 	in	the	sky	--	a	 ver 	 y 	 	similar	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	to	what	 Al 	 bert 	 	Einstein	 g 	 ave 	 	 a 	 s 	 	to	how	he	 imagin 	 ed 	 	the	 force 	 s 	 	of	 relat 	 ivity 	 	,	when	he	was	 st 	 rug 	 gling 	 	with	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	how	it	 work 	 ed 	 	.
But	it	 happen 	 s 	 	in	other	 activ 	 ities 	 	.
For	 in 	 stance 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	student	of	mine	,	Susan	 Jack 	 son 	 	from	Australia	,	who	did	work	with	some	of	the	 lead 	 ing 	 	 athlete 	 s 	 	in	the	world	.
And	you	see	here	in	 th 	 is 	 	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	of	an	 Olymp 	 ic 	 	 s 	 ka 	 ter 	 	,	the	same	essential	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	of	the	 phenomen 	 ology 	 	of	the	inner	state	of	the	person	.
You	do	n't	think	;	it	 go 	 es 	 	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	,	if	you	merge	 your 	 self 	 	with	the	music	,	and	so	forth	.
It	 happen 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	in	the	most	 re 	 cent 	 	book	I	wrote	,	 call 	 ed 	 	``	Good	 Bu 	 s 	 iness 	 	,	''	where	I	 interview 	 ed 	 	some	of	the	 CEO 	 s 	 	who	had	 be 	 en 	 	 nominate 	 d 	 	by	 the 	 ir 	 	 peer 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	both	 ver 	 y 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 ethic 	 al 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 social 	 ly 	 	 respons 	 ible 	 	.
You	see	that	these	people	define	success	 a 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 help 	 s 	 	 other 	 s 	 	and	at	the	same	time	 make 	 s 	 	you	feel	happy	 a 	 s 	 	you	are	 work 	 ing 	 	at	it	.
And	like	all	of	these	 success 	 ful 	 	and	 respons 	 ible 	 	 CEO 	 s 	 	say	,	you	ca	n't	have	just	one	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	be	 success 	 ful 	 	if	you	want	a	 meaning 	 ful 	 	and	 success 	 ful 	 	job	.
 An 	 ita 	 	 Rod 	 d 	 ick 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	one	of	these	 CEO 	 s 	 	we	 interview 	 ed 	 	.
She	is	the	founder	of	Body	Shop	,	the	natural	 cosmetic 	 s 	 	king	.
It	's	kind	of	a	 pass 	 ion 	 	that	 come 	 s 	 	from	 do 	 ing 	 	the	best	and	 hav 	 ing 	 	flow	while	you	're	 work 	 ing 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	little	quote	from	Masaru	Ibuka	,	who	was	at	that	time	 start 	 ing 	 	out	 Son 	 y 	 	 with 	 out 	 	any	money	,	 with 	 out 	 	a	product	--	they	did	n't	have	a	product	,	they	did	n't	have	 any 	 thing 	 	,	but	they	had	an	idea	.
And	the	idea	he	had	was	to	establish	a	place	of	work	where	 engineer 	 s 	 	can	feel	the	joy	of	 techno 	 logical 	 	 innov 	 ation 	 	,	be	aware	of	 the 	 ir 	 	mission	to	 socie 	 ty 	 	and	work	to	 the 	 ir 	 	heart	's	content	.
I	could	n't	improve	on	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	good	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	how	flow	 enter 	 s 	 	the	 work 	 place 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	when	we	do	 stud 	 ies 	 	--	we	have	,	with	other	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	around	the	world	,	 d 	 one 	 	over	8,000	 interview 	 s 	 	of	people	--	from	 Dominic 	 an 	 	 monk 	 s 	 	,	to	blind	 n 	 un 	 s 	 	,	to	 Himalaya 	 n 	 	 climb 	 ers 	 	,	to	Navajo	 shepherd 	 s 	 	--	who	enjoy	 the 	 ir 	 	work	.
And	 regard 	 less 	 	of	the	culture	,	 regard 	 less 	 	of	education	or	 what 	 ever 	 	,	there	are	these	seven	 condition 	 s 	 	that	seem	to	be	there	when	a	person	is	in	flow	.
There	's	 th 	 is 	 	focus	that	,	once	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 intens 	 e 	 	,	 lead 	 s 	 	to	a	sense	of	 ecstas 	 y 	 	,	a	sense	of	 clar 	 ity 	 	:	you	know	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	you	want	to	do	from	one	moment	to	the	other	;	you	get	 im 	 mediate 	 	 feed 	 back 	 	.
You	know	that	what	you	need	to	do	is	possible	to	do	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	difficult	,	and	sense	of	time	 disappear 	 s 	 	,	you	forget	 your 	 self 	 	,	you	feel	part	of	 some 	 thing 	 	 large 	 r 	 	.
And	once	the	 condition 	 s 	 	are	present	,	what	you	are	 do 	 ing 	 	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	worth	 do 	 ing 	 	for	 it 	 s 	 	own	sake	.
In	our	 stud 	 ies 	 	,	we	represent	the	 every 	 day 	 	life	of	people	in	 th 	 is 	 	simple	scheme	.
And	we	can	measure	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 precise 	 ly 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	give	people	 electron 	 ic 	 	 page 	 rs 	 	that	go	off	10	 time 	 s 	 	a	day	,	and	 when 	 ever 	 	they	go	off	you	say	what	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	,	how	you	feel	,	where	you	are	,	what	you	're	 think 	 ing 	 	about	.
And	two	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	measure	is	the	amount	of	 challeng 	 e 	 	people	experience	at	that	moment	and	the	amount	of	skill	that	they	feel	they	have	at	that	moment	.
So	for	each	person	we	can	establish	an	average	,	which	is	the	center	of	the	 dia 	 gram 	 	.
That	would	be	your	mean	level	of	 challeng 	 e 	 	and	skill	,	which	will	be	different	from	that	of	 any 	 body 	 	else	.
But	you	have	a	kind	of	a	set	point	there	,	which	would	be	in	the	middle	.
If	we	know	what	that	set	point	is	,	we	can	predict	 fair 	 ly 	 	 accurate 	 ly 	 	when	you	will	be	in	flow	,	and	it	will	be	when	your	 challeng 	 es 	 	are	 high 	 er 	 	than	average	and	 skill 	 s 	 	are	 high 	 er 	 	than	average	.
And	you	may	be	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	from	other	people	,	but	for	 every 	 one 	 	that	flow	channel	,	that	area	there	,	will	be	when	you	are	 do 	 ing 	 	what	you	 re 	 ally 	 	like	to	do	--	play	the	piano	,	be	with	your	best	friend	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	work	,	if	work	is	what	 provide 	 s 	 	flow	for	you	.
And	then	the	other	 area 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	less	and	less	positive	.
 Aro 	 usal 	 	is	still	good	 be 	 cause 	 	you	are	 over 	 - 	 challeng 	 ed 	 	there	.
Your	 skill 	 s 	 	are	not	 quit 	 e 	 	 a 	 s 	 	high	 a 	 s 	 	they	should	be	,	but	you	can	move	 in 	 to 	 	flow	 fair 	 ly 	 	 eas 	 ily 	 	by	just	 develop 	 ing 	 	a	little	more	skill	.
So	,	arousal	is	the	area	where	most	people	learn	from	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	where	they	're	 push 	 ed 	 	beyond	 the 	 ir 	 	comfort	zone	and	to	enter	that	--	going	back	to	flow	--	then	they	develop	 high 	 er 	 	 skill 	 s 	 	.
Control	is	 al 	 so 	 	a	good	place	to	be	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	you	feel	 comfort 	 able 	 	,	but	not	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	.
It	's	not	 ver 	 y 	 	 challeng 	 ing 	 	any	more	.
And	if	you	want	to	enter	flow	from	control	,	you	have	to	 in 	 crease 	 	the	 challeng 	 es 	 	.
So	 t 	 hose 	 	two	are	ideal	and	 comple 	 ment 	 ary 	 	 area 	 s 	 	from	which	flow	is	easy	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	.
The	other	 combination 	 s 	 	of	 challeng 	 e 	 	and	skill	 be 	 come 	 	 progress 	 ively 	 	less	optimal	.
 Re 	 lax 	 ation 	 	is	fine	--	you	still	feel	 O 	 K 	 	.
 Bo 	 re 	 dom 	 	 begin 	 s 	 	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	aversive	and	 a 	 pathy 	 	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	negative	:	you	do	n't	feel	that	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	,	you	do	n't	use	your	 skill 	 s 	 	,	there	's	no	 challeng 	 e 	 	.
 Un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	a	lot	of	people	's	experience	is	in	 a 	 pathy 	 	.
The	largest	single	contributor	to	that	experience	is	 watch 	 ing 	 	 tele 	 vision 	 	;	the	next	one	is	 be 	 ing 	 	in	the	 bath 	 room 	 	,	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	.
Even	 th 	 ough 	 	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 watch 	 ing 	 	 tele 	 vision 	 	about	seven	to	eight	percent	of	the	time	is	in	flow	,	but	that	's	when	you	 choos 	 e 	 	a	program	you	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	watch	and	you	get	 feed 	 back 	 	from	it	.
So	the	question	we	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	address	--	and	I	'm	way	over	time	--	is	how	to	put	more	and	more	of	 every 	 day 	 	life	in	that	flow	channel	.
And	that	is	the	kind	of	 challeng 	 e 	 	that	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	.
And	some	of	you	 obvious 	 ly 	 	know	how	to	do	that	 spontane 	 ously 	 	 with 	 out 	 	any	 ad 	 vice 	 	,	but	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	a	lot	of	people	do	n't	.
And	that	's	what	our	 man 	 date 	 	is	,	in	a	way	,	to	do	.
Thank	you	.

 For 	 rest 	 	North	:	The	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	any	 collabor 	 ation 	 	 start 	 s 	 	with	a	conversation	.
And	I	would	like	to	share	with	you	some	of	the	bits	of	the	conversation	that	we	 start 	 ed 	 	with	.
I	grew	up	in	a	log	 cab 	 in 	 	in	 Wash 	 ington 	 	state	with	too	much	time	on	my	 hand 	 s 	 	.
 Y 	 ves 	 	 Be 	 har 	 	:	And	in	 scen 	 ic 	 	 Switzer 	 land 	 	for	me	.
 F 	 N 	 	:	I	 al 	 ways 	 	had	a	 pass 	 ion 	 	for	 alter 	 native 	 	 vehicle 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	land	yacht	 rac 	 ing 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	desert	in	Nevada	.
 Y 	 B 	 	:	 Comb 	 in 	 ation 	 	of	 wind 	 surfing 	 	and	 ski 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 invent 	 ion 	 	there	.
 F 	 N 	 	:	And	I	 al 	 so 	 	had	an	interest	in	 danger 	 ous 	 	 invent 	 ions 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	100,000-volt	Tesla	coil	that	I	built	in	my	 bed 	 room 	 	,	much	to	the	 dis 	 may 	 	of	my	mother	.
 Y 	 B 	 	:	To	the	 dis 	 may 	 	of	my	mother	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 danger 	 ous 	 	 teen 	 age 	 	fashion	right	there	.
 F 	 N 	 	:	And	I	 br 	 ought 	 	 th 	 is 	 	all	together	,	 th 	 is 	 	 pass 	 ion 	 	with	 alter 	 native 	 	energy	and	 rac 	 ed 	 	a	solar	car	 a 	 cross 	 	Australia	--	 al 	 so 	 	the	U.S.	and	Japan	.
 Y 	 B 	 	:	So	,	wind	power	,	solar	power	--	we	had	a	lot	to	talk	about	.
We	had	a	lot	that	got	us	 excit 	 ed 	 	.
So	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	do	a	special	project	together	.
To	combine	 engineer 	 ing 	 	and	design	and	...
 F 	 N 	 	:	 Re 	 ally 	 	make	a	fully	 integrate 	 d 	 	product	,	 some 	 thing 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
 Y 	 B 	 	:	And	we	made	a	baby	.
 F 	 N 	 	:	Can	you	 br 	 ing 	 	out	our	baby	?
 Th 	 is 	 	baby	is	fully	electric	.
It	 go 	 es 	 	150	 mile 	 s 	 	an	hour	.
It	's	twice	the	range	of	any	electric	 motor 	 cycle 	 	.
 Re 	 ally 	 	the	 excit 	 ing 	 	thing	about	a	 motor 	 cycle 	 	is	just	the	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 integ 	 ration 	 	of	 engineer 	 ing 	 	and	design	.
It	's	got	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	user	experience	.
It	was	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	with	 Y 	 ves 	 	 Be 	 har 	 	.
He	came	up	with	our	name	and	logo	.	We	're	 Miss 	 ion 	 	 Motor 	 s 	 	.
And	we	've	 on 	 ly 	 	got	three	 minute 	 s 	 	,	but	we	could	talk	about	it	for	 hour 	 s 	 	.
 Y 	 B 	 	:	Thank	you	.

When	 philanthro 	 py 	 	was	 re 	 invent 	 ed 	 	a	century	ago	,	when	the	 found 	 ation 	 	form	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 invent 	 ed 	 	,	they	did	n't	think	of	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	on	the	wrong	side	of	these	either	.
In	fact	they	would	never	have	thought	of	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 a 	 s 	 	closed	and	set	in	 the 	 ir 	 	ways	,	 a 	 s 	 	 s 	 low 	 	to	respond	to	new	 challeng 	 es 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	small	and	 risk 	 - 	 a 	 verse 	 	.
And	in	fact	they	 we 	 re 	 	n't	.	 The 	 y 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 invent 	 ing 	 	 char 	 ity 	 	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 time 	 s 	 	,	what	 Rock 	 efeller 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	``	the	business	of	 benevol 	 ence 	 	.	''
But	by	the	end	of	the	20th	century	,	a	new	generation	of	 critic 	 s 	 	and	 reform 	 ers 	 	had	come	to	see	 philanthro 	 py 	 	just	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
The	thing	to	watch	for	 a 	 s 	 	a	global	 philanthro 	 py 	 	industry	 come 	 s 	 	about	--	and	that	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	--	is	how	the	 aspir 	 ation 	 	is	to	flip	these	old	 assumption 	 s 	 	,	for	 philanthro 	 py 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	open	and	big	and	fast	and	 connect 	 ed 	 	,	in	service	of	the	long	term	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 entrepreneur 	 ial 	 	energy	is	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	from	 man 	 y 	 	 quarter 	 s 	 	.
And	it	's	driven	and	 propel 	 led 	 	forward	by	new	 lead 	 ers 	 	,	like	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	people	here	,	by	new	 tool 	 s 	 	,	like	the	 one 	 s 	 	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	here	,	and	by	new	 pressure 	 s 	 	.
I	've	 be 	 en 	 	 follow 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	change	for	 quit 	 e 	 	a	while	now	,	and	 particip 	 ating 	 	in	it	.
 Th 	 is 	 	report	is	our	main	public	report	.
What	it	 tell 	 s 	 	is	the	story	of	how	 to 	 day 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	could	be	 a 	 s 	 	historic	 a 	 s 	 	100	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
What	I	want	to	do	is	share	some	of	the	 cool 	 est 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	going	on	with	you	.
And	 a 	 s 	 	I	do	that	,	I	'm	not	going	to	 d 	 well 	 	much	on	the	 ver 	 y 	 	large	 philanthro 	 py 	 	that	 every 	 body 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	 know 	 s 	 	about	--	the	 Gate 	 s 	 	or	the	 So 	 ros 	 	or	the	Google	.
 In 	 stead 	 	,	what	I	want	to	do	is	talk	about	the	 philanthro 	 py 	 	of	all	of	us	:	the	 democrat 	 ization 	 	of	 philanthro 	 py 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	moment	in	 histo 	 ry 	 	when	the	average	person	 ha 	 s 	 	more	power	than	at	any	time	.
What	I	'm	going	to	do	is	look	at	five	 categor 	 ies 	 	of	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	each	of	which	 challeng 	 es 	 	an	old	assumption	of	 philanthro 	 py 	 	.
The	first	is	mass	 collabor 	 ation 	 	,	 represent 	 ed 	 	here	by	Wikipedia	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	may	surprise	you	.
But	remember	,	 philanthro 	 py 	 	is	about	giving	of	time	and	talent	,	not	just	money	.
 C 	 lay 	 	 Shi 	 rky 	 	,	that	great	 chronic 	 ler 	 	of	 every 	 thing 	 	 network 	 ed 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 capture 	 d 	 	the	assumption	that	 th 	 is 	 	 challeng 	 es 	 	in	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	way	.
He	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	We	have	lived	in	 th 	 is 	 	world	where	little	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 d 	 one 	 	for	love	and	big	 thing 	 s 	 	for	money	.
 N 	 ow 	 	we	have	Wikipedia	.
 Sud 	 den 	 ly 	 	big	 thing 	 s 	 	can	be	 d 	 one 	 	for	love	.	''
 Wat 	 ch 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	spring	,	for	Paul	 Hawk 	 en 	 	's	new	book	--	Author	and	entrepreneur	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	may	know	about	.
The	book	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 B 	 less 	 ed 	 	 Un 	 rest 	 	.	''
And	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	out	,	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	wiki	 s 	 ites 	 	under	the	label	 WISE 	 R 	 	,	are	going	to	launch	at	the	same	time	.
 WISE 	 R 	 	 stand 	 s 	 	for	World	 In 	 d 	 ex 	 	for	 So 	 cial 	 	and	 Environment 	 al 	 	 Respons 	 ibility 	 	.
 WISE 	 R 	 	 set 	 s 	 	out	to	document	,	link	and	empower	what	Paul	 call 	 s 	 	the	largest	 move 	 ment 	 	,	and	 fast 	 est 	 - 	 growing 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	in	human	 histo 	 ry 	 	:	 human 	 ity 	 	's	 collect 	 ive 	 	 immun 	 e 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	to	 to 	 day 	 	's	 threat 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	all	of	these	big	 thing 	 s 	 	for	love	--	 experiment 	 s 	 	--	are	n't	going	to	take	off	.
But	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	do	are	going	to	be	the	 big 	 gest 	 	,	the	most	open	,	the	 fast 	 est 	 	,	the	most	 connect 	 ed 	 	form	of	 philanthro 	 py 	 	in	human	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
Second	 categor 	 y 	 	is	 on 	 line 	 	 philanthro 	 py 	 	 market 	 place 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	,	of	course	,	to	 philanthro 	 py 	 	what	 e 	 Bay 	 	and	Amazon	are	to	commerce	.
Think	of	it	 a 	 s 	 	 peer 	 - 	 to 	 - 	 peer 	 	 philanthro 	 py 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	 challeng 	 es 	 	yet	 an 	 other 	 	assumption	,	which	is	that	 organize 	 d 	 	 philanthro 	 py 	 	is	 on 	 ly 	 	for	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 wealth 	 y 	 	.
Take	a	look	,	if	you	have	n't	,	at	 Don 	 ors 	 Choos 	 e 	 	.
Omidyar	 Net 	 work 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	made	a	big	 invest 	 ment 	 	in	 Don 	 ors 	 Choos 	 e 	 	.
It	's	one	of	the	best	known	of	these	new	 market 	 place 	 s 	 	where	a	donor	can	go	straight	 in 	 to 	 	a	 class 	 room 	 	and	connect	with	what	a	teacher	 say 	 s 	 	they	need	.
Take	a	look	at	 Chan 	 ging 	 	the	Present	,	 start 	 ed 	 	by	a	 TED 	 ster 	 	,	next	time	you	need	a	 wed 	 d 	 ing 	 	present	or	a	 holi 	 day 	 	present	.
 G 	 ive 	 India 	 	is	for	a	whole	country	.
And	it	 go 	 es 	 	on	and	on	.
The	third	 categor 	 y 	 	is	 represent 	 ed 	 	by	 War 	 ren 	 	Buffet	,	which	I	call	 aggreg 	 ated 	 	giving	.
It	's	not	just	that	 War 	 ren 	 	Buffet	was	so	 amaz 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 gen 	 er 	 ous 	 	in	that	historic	act	last	summer	.
It	's	that	he	 challeng 	 ed 	 	 an 	 other 	 	assumption	,	that	every	giver	should	have	his	or	her	own	fund	or	 found 	 ation 	 	.
There	are	now	,	 to 	 day 	 	,	so	 man 	 y 	 	new	 fund 	 s 	 	that	are	 aggreg 	 ating 	 	giving	and	 invest 	 ing 	 	,	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	together	people	around	a	common	goal	,	to	think	 big 	 ger 	 	.
One	of	the	best	known	is	 A 	 cum 	 en 	 	Fund	,	led	by	 Jac 	 que 	 line 	 	 No 	 vogratz 	 	,	a	 TED 	 ster 	 	who	got	a	big	boost	here	at	TED	.
But	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 other 	 s 	 	:	New	 Pro 	 fit 	 	in	 Cam 	 bridge 	 	,	New	School	's	 Ven 	 ture 	 	Fund	in	Silicon	 Valle 	 y 	 	,	 Ven 	 ture 	 	 Phil 	 anthro 	 py 	 	Partners	in	 Wash 	 ington 	 	,	Global	Fund	for	Women	in	San	 Francis 	 co 	 	.
Take	a	look	at	these	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	 fund 	 s 	 	are	to	 philanthro 	 py 	 	what	venture	capital	,	private	 equ 	 ity 	 	,	and	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	mutual	 fund 	 s 	 	are	to	 invest 	 ing 	 	,	but	with	a	twist	--	 be 	 cause 	 	often	a	community	 form 	 s 	 	around	these	 fund 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 ha 	 s 	 	at	 A 	 cum 	 en 	 	and	other	 place 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	imagine	for	a	second	these	first	three	 type 	 s 	 	of	 experiment 	 s 	 	:	mass	 collabor 	 ation 	 	,	 on 	 line 	 	 market 	 place 	 s 	 	,	 aggreg 	 ated 	 	giving	.
And	understand	how	they	help	us	 re 	 - 	 perceive 	 	what	 organize 	 d 	 	 philanthro 	 py 	 	is	.
It	's	not	about	 found 	 ations 	 	 necess 	 arily 	 	;	it	's	about	the	rest	of	us	.
I	'm	going	to	look	 quick 	 ly 	 	at	the	fourth	and	fifth	 categor 	 ies 	 	,	which	are	 innov 	 ation 	 	,	 com 	 petition 	 s 	 	and	social	 invest 	 ing 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	 bet 	 ting 	 	a	visible	 com 	 petition 	 	,	a	prize	,	can	attract	talent	and	money	to	some	of	the	most	difficult	 issue 	 s 	 	,	and	 there 	 by 	 	speed	the	solution	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 tackle 	 s 	 	yet	 an 	 other 	 	assumption	,	that	the	giver	and	the	 organ 	 ization 	 	is	at	the	center	,	 a 	 s 	 	 oppos 	 ed 	 	to	 put 	 ting 	 	the	problem	at	the	center	.
You	can	look	to	these	 innov 	 ators 	 	to	help	us	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	with	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 requir 	 e 	 	 techno 	 logical 	 	or	scientific	solution	.
That	 leav 	 es 	 	the	final	 categor 	 y 	 	,	social	 invest 	 ing 	 	,	which	is	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 any 	 way 	 	,	the	 big 	 gest 	 	of	them	all	,	 represent 	 ed 	 	here	by	 Xigi 	 .net 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	,	of	course	,	 tackle 	 s 	 	the	 big 	 gest 	 	assumption	of	all	,	that	business	is	business	,	and	 philanthro 	 py 	 	is	the	vehicle	of	people	who	want	to	create	change	in	the	world	.
Xigi	is	a	new	community	 s 	 ite 	 	that	's	built	by	the	community	,	 link 	 ing 	 	and	mapping	 th 	 is 	 	new	social	capital	market	.
It	 list 	 s 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	1,000	 ent 	 ities 	 	that	are	 off 	 er 	 ing 	 	debt	and	 equ 	 ity 	 	for	social	enterprise	.
So	we	can	look	to	these	 innov 	 ators 	 	to	help	us	remember	that	if	we	can	leverage	even	a	small	amount	of	the	capital	that	 seek 	 s 	 	a	return	,	the	good	that	can	be	driven	could	be	 astonish 	 ing 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	what	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	here	is	that	we	're	not	 think 	 ing 	 	our	way	 in 	 to 	 	a	new	way	of	 act 	 ing 	 	;	we	're	 act 	 ing 	 	our	way	 in 	 to 	 	a	new	way	of	 think 	 ing 	 	.
 Phil 	 anthro 	 py 	 	is	 re 	 organ 	 izing 	 	 it 	 self 	 	before	our	 ver 	 y 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	.
And	even	 th 	 ough 	 	all	of	the	 experiment 	 s 	 	and	all	of	the	big	 giver 	 s 	 	do	n't	yet	fulfill	 th 	 is 	 	 aspir 	 ation 	 	,	I	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	new	 zeitge 	 ist 	 	:	open	,	big	,	fast	,	 connect 	 ed 	 	,	and	,	let	us	 al 	 so 	 	hope	,	long	.
We	have	got	to	 real 	 ize 	 	that	it	is	going	to	take	a	long	time	to	do	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
If	we	do	n't	develop	the	 stam 	 ina 	 	to	stick	with	 thing 	 s 	 	--	 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	you	pick	,	stick	with	it	--	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	is	just	going	to	be	,	you	know	,	a	fad	.
But	I	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 hope 	 ful 	 	.
And	I	'm	 hope 	 ful 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 philanthro 	 py 	 	that	's	 re 	 organ 	 izing 	 	 it 	 self 	 	,	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	whole	other	 port 	 ions 	 	of	the	social	sector	,	and	of	business	,	that	are	 bus 	 y 	 	 challeng 	 ing 	 	``	business	 a 	 s 	 	usual	.	''
And	 every 	 where 	 	I	go	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	here	at	TED	,	I	feel	that	there	is	a	new	moral	 hung 	 er 	 	that	is	growing	.
What	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	is	people	 re 	 ally 	 	 wrestl 	 ing 	 	to	 de 	 scribe 	 	what	is	 th 	 is 	 	new	thing	that	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
 Word 	 s 	 	like	``	 philanthro 	 capital 	 ism 	 	,	''	and	``	natural	 capital 	 ism 	 	,	''	and	``	 philanthro 	 entrepreneur 	 	,	''	and	``	venture	 philanthro 	 py 	 	.	''
We	do	n't	have	a	language	for	it	yet	.
 What 	 ever 	 	we	call	it	,	it	's	new	,	it	's	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	and	I	think	it	's	gong	to	 quit 	 e 	 	significant	.
And	that	's	where	my	 imagin 	 ed 	 	future	 come 	 s 	 	in	,	which	I	am	going	to	call	the	social	 s 	 ing 	 ular 	 ity 	 	.
 Man 	 y 	 	of	you	will	 real 	 ize 	 	that	I	'm	 rip 	 ping 	 	a	bit	off	of	the	science	fiction	writer	 Ver 	 nor 	 	 V 	 ing 	 e 	 	's	 not 	 ion 	 	of	a	 techno 	 logical 	 	 s 	 ing 	 ular 	 ity 	 	,	where	a	number	of	 trend 	 s 	 	 accele 	 rate 	 	and	 converg 	 e 	 	and	come	together	to	create	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	a	 shock 	 ing 	 ly 	 	new	 re 	 ality 	 	.
It	may	be	that	the	social	 s 	 ing 	 ular 	 ity 	 	 a 	 head 	 	is	the	one	that	we	fear	the	most	:	a	 converg 	 ence 	 	of	 catastroph 	 es 	 	,	of	 environment 	 al 	 	degradation	,	of	 weapon 	 s 	 	of	mass	 destruct 	 ion 	 	,	of	 pan 	 demic 	 s 	 	,	of	poverty	.
That	's	 be 	 cause 	 	our	ability	to	confront	the	 problem 	 s 	 	that	we	face	 ha 	 s 	 	not	 ke 	 pt 	 	pace	with	our	ability	to	create	them	.
And	 a 	 s 	 	we	've	heard	here	,	it	is	no	 exagge 	 ration 	 	to	say	that	we	hold	the	future	of	our	 civil 	 ization 	 	in	our	 hand 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	never	before	.
The	question	is	,	is	there	a	positive	social	 s 	 ing 	 ular 	 ity 	 	?
 I 	 s 	 	there	a	 front 	 ier 	 	for	us	of	how	we	live	together	?
Our	future	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	to	be	 imagin 	 ed 	 	.
We	can	create	a	future	where	hope	and	 histo 	 ry 	 	 rhym 	 e 	 	.
But	we	have	a	problem	.
Our	experience	to	date	,	both	 individual 	 ly 	 	and	 collect 	 ively 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	prepared	us	for	what	we	're	going	to	need	to	do	,	or	who	we	're	going	to	need	to	be	.
We	are	going	to	need	a	new	generation	of	citizen	 lead 	 ers 	 	 will 	 ing 	 	to	commit	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	to	growing	and	changing	and	 learn 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 rapid 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	possible	.
That	's	why	I	have	one	last	thing	I	want	to	show	you	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	photograph	taken	about	100	 year 	 s 	 	ago	of	my	 grand 	 father 	 	and	 great 	 - 	 grand 	 father 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	 news 	 paper 	 	 publish 	 er 	 	and	a	 bank 	 er 	 	.
And	they	 we 	 re 	 	great	community	 lead 	 ers 	 	.
And	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	great	 philanthro 	 pist 	 s 	 	.
I	keep	 th 	 is 	 	photograph	close	by	to	me	--	it	's	in	my	 off 	 ice 	 	--	 be 	 cause 	 	I	've	 al 	 ways 	 	felt	a	 mystic 	 al 	 	 connect 	 ion 	 	to	these	two	men	,	both	of	whom	I	never	 k 	 new 	 	.
And	so	,	in	 the 	 ir 	 	honor	,	I	want	to	 off 	 er 	 	you	 th 	 is 	 	blank	slide	.
And	I	want	you	to	imagine	that	 th 	 is 	 	a	photograph	of	you	.
And	I	want	you	to	think	about	the	community	that	you	want	to	be	part	of	creating	.
 What 	 ever 	 	that	 mean 	 s 	 	to	you	.
And	I	want	you	to	imagine	that	it	's	100	 year 	 s 	 	from	now	,	and	your	 grand 	 child 	 	,	or	 great 	 - 	 grand 	 child 	 	,	or	niece	or	nephew	or	 god 	 - 	 child 	 	,	is	looking	at	 th 	 is 	 	photograph	of	you	.
What	is	the	story	you	most	want	for	them	to	tell	?

 Han 	 na 	 	 Ro 	 s 	 in 	 	:	New	data	on	the	rise	of	women
We	are	now	going	through	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	and	unprecedented	moment	where	the	power	 dynamic 	 s 	 	between	men	and	women	are	shifting	 ver 	 y 	 	 rapid 	 ly 	 	,	and	in	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	 place 	 s 	 	where	it	 count 	 s 	 	the	most	,	women	are	,	in	fact	,	taking	control	of	 every 	 thing 	 	.
In	my	mother	's	day	,	she	did	n't	go	to	college	.
Not	a	lot	of	women	did	.
And	now	,	for	every	two	men	who	get	a	college	degree	,	three	women	will	do	the	same	.
Women	,	for	the	first	time	 th 	 is 	 	year	,	 be 	 came 	 	the	 major 	 ity 	 	of	the	American	 work 	 force 	 	.
And	they	're	 start 	 ing 	 	to	dominate	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 profession 	 s 	 	--	 doctor 	 s 	 	,	 lawyer 	 s 	 	,	 bank 	 ers 	 	,	 account 	 ants 	 	.
Over	50	percent	of	 manage 	 rs 	 	are	women	these	 day 	 s 	 	,	and	in	the	15	 profession 	 s 	 	 project 	 ed 	 	to	grow	the	most	in	the	next	decade	,	all	but	two	of	them	are	 dominate 	 d 	 	by	women	.
So	the	global	 eco 	 nomy 	 	is	 be 	 coming 	 	a	place	where	women	are	more	 success 	 ful 	 	than	men	,	 believ 	 e 	 	it	or	not	,	and	these	economic	 change 	 s 	 	are	 start 	 ing 	 	to	 rapid 	 ly 	 	affect	our	culture	--	what	our	romantic	 come 	 dies 	 	look	like	,	what	our	 marriage 	 s 	 	look	like	,	what	our	 d 	 ating 	 	 live 	 s 	 	look	like	,	and	our	new	set	of	 super 	 heroes 	 	.
For	a	long	time	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	image	of	American	 man 	 hood 	 	that	 dominate 	 d 	 	--	tough	,	 rug 	 ged 	 	,	in	control	of	his	own	environment	.
A	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	the	 Mar 	 lboro 	 	Man	was	 retire 	 d 	 	and	 replace 	 d 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	much	less	 impress 	 ive 	 	specimen	,	who	is	a	 paro 	 dy 	 	of	American	 man 	 hood 	 	,	and	that	's	what	we	have	in	our	 commercial 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
The	phrase	``	 first 	 - 	 born 	 	son	''	is	so	 deep 	 ly 	 	 ing 	 rain 	 ed 	 	in	our	 conscious 	 ness 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	statistic	 al 	 one 	 	 shock 	 ed 	 	me	.
In	American	 fertil 	 ity 	 	 clinic 	 s 	 	,	75	percent	of	 couple 	 s 	 	are	 request 	 ing 	 	 girl 	 s 	 	and	not	 boy 	 s 	 	.
And	in	 place 	 s 	 	where	you	would	n't	think	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	South	Korea	,	India	and	China	,	the	 ver 	 y 	 	strict	 patriarch 	 al 	 	 socie 	 ties 	 	are	 start 	 ing 	 	to	break	down	a	little	,	and	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	are	no	 long 	 er 	 	 strong 	 ly 	 	 prefer 	 ring 	 	 first 	 - 	 born 	 	 son 	 s 	 	.
If	you	think	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	if	you	just	open	your	 eye 	 s 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	 possibil 	 ity 	 	and	start	to	connect	the	 dot 	 s 	 	,	you	can	see	the	evidence	 every 	 where 	 	.
You	can	see	it	in	college	 gradu 	 ation 	 	 pattern 	 s 	 	,	in	job	 project 	 ions 	 	,	in	our	marriage	 statistic 	 s 	 	,	you	can	see	it	in	the	 Ice 	 land 	 ic 	 	 election 	 s 	 	,	which	you	'll	hear	about	 lat 	 er 	 	,	and	you	can	see	it	on	South	Korean	 survey 	 s 	 	on	son	 pre 	 ference 	 	,	that	 some 	 thing 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	and	unprecedented	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	with	women	.
 Certain 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	the	first	time	that	we	've	had	great	progress	with	women	.
The	'20s	and	the	'60s	 al 	 so 	 	come	to	mind	.
But	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	is	that	,	back	then	,	it	was	driven	by	a	 ver 	 y 	 	passionate	feminist	 move 	 ment 	 	that	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	project	 it 	 s 	 	own	 desir 	 es 	 	,	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	time	,	it	's	not	about	 pass 	 ion 	 	,	and	it	's	not	about	any	kind	of	 move 	 ment 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	just	about	the	 fact 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	economic	moment	that	we	live	in	.
The	200,000-year	period	in	which	men	have	 be 	 en 	 	top	dog	is	 tru 	 ly 	 	coming	to	an	end	,	 believ 	 e 	 	it	or	not	,	and	that	's	why	I	talk	about	the	``	end	of	men	.	''
 N 	 ow 	 	all	you	men	out	there	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	the	moment	where	you	tune	out	or	throw	some	 tomato 	 es 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	point	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	to	all	of	us	.
I	 my 	 self 	 	have	a	husband	and	a	father	and	two	 son 	 s 	 	whom	I	 d 	 early 	 	love	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	why	I	like	to	talk	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	we	do	n't	 acknowledg 	 e 	 	it	,	then	the	 transit 	 ion 	 	will	be	 pre 	 tty 	 	 pain 	 ful 	 	.
But	if	we	do	take	account	of	it	,	then	I	think	it	will	go	much	more	 smooth 	 ly 	 	.
I	first	 start 	 ed 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	about	a	year	and	a	half	ago	.
I	was	 read 	 ing 	 	 head 	 lines 	 	about	the	 recess 	 ion 	 	just	like	 any 	 one 	 	else	,	and	I	 start 	 ed 	 	to	notice	a	distinct	pattern	--	that	the	 recess 	 ion 	 	was	 affect 	 ing 	 	men	much	more	 deep 	 ly 	 	than	it	was	 affect 	 ing 	 	women	.
And	I	 remember 	 ed 	 	back	to	about	10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	when	I	read	a	book	by	Susan	Faludi	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 Stiff 	 ed 	 	:	The	Betrayal	of	the	American	Man	,	''	in	which	she	 de 	 scribed 	 	how	hard	the	 recess 	 ion 	 	had	hit	men	,	and	I	 start 	 ed 	 	to	think	about	 whet 	 her 	 	it	had	gotten	 wo 	 rse 	 	 th 	 is 	 	time	around	in	 th 	 is 	 	 recess 	 ion 	 	.
And	I	 real 	 ized 	 	that	two	 thing 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	different	 th 	 is 	 	time	around	.
The	first	was	that	these	 we 	 re 	 	no	 long 	 er 	 	just	 tempor 	 ary 	 	 hit 	 s 	 	that	the	 recess 	 ion 	 	was	giving	men	--	that	 th 	 is 	 	was	 reflect 	 ing 	 	a	 deep 	 er 	 	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	shift	in	our	global	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
And	second	,	that	the	story	was	no	 long 	 er 	 	just	about	the	crisis	of	men	,	but	it	was	 al 	 so 	 	about	what	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	to	women	.
And	now	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	second	set	of	 slide 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	 head 	 lines 	 	about	what	's	 be 	 en 	 	going	on	with	women	in	the	next	few	 year 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	 thing 	 s 	 	we	never	could	have	 imagin 	 ed 	 	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
Women	,	a	 major 	 ity 	 	of	the	 work 	 place 	 	.
And	labor	 statistic 	 s 	 	:	women	take	up	most	 manage 	 rial 	 	 job 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	second	set	of	 head 	 lines 	 	--	you	can	see	that	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	and	 marriage 	 s 	 	are	 start 	 ing 	 	to	shift	.
And	look	at	that	last	 head 	 line 	 	--	young	women	 earn 	 ing 	 	more	than	young	men	.
That	 part 	 icular 	 	 head 	 line 	 	 come 	 s 	 	to	me	from	a	market	research	firm	.
 The 	 y 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	by	one	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 client 	 s 	 	who	was	going	to	buy	 house 	 s 	 	in	that	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	in	the	future	.
And	they	 expect 	 ed 	 	that	it	would	be	young	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	,	or	young	men	,	just	like	it	had	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	.
But	in	fact	,	they	found	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	surprising	.
It	was	young	,	single	women	who	 we 	 re 	 	the	major	 purchase 	 rs 	 	of	 house 	 s 	 	in	the	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	.
And	so	they	 decide 	 d 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 intrigu 	 ed 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	 find 	 ing 	 	,	to	do	a	 nation 	 wide 	 	survey	.
So	they	spread	out	all	the	census	data	,	and	what	they	found	,	the	guy	 de 	 scribed 	 	to	me	 a 	 s 	 	a	 shock 	 er 	 	,	which	is	that	in	1,997	out	of	2,000	 commun 	 ities 	 	,	women	,	young	women	,	 we 	 re 	 	making	more	money	than	young	men	.
So	here	you	have	a	generation	of	young	women	who	grow	up	 think 	 ing 	 	of	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	more	 power 	 ful 	 	 earn 	 ers 	 	than	the	young	men	around	them	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	I	've	just	laid	out	the	picture	for	you	,	but	I	still	have	n't	 explain 	 ed 	 	to	you	why	 th 	 is 	 	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
And	in	a	moment	,	I	'm	going	to	show	you	a	graph	,	and	what	you	'll	see	on	 th 	 is 	 	graph	--	it	 begin 	 s 	 	in	1973	,	just	before	women	start	 flood 	 ing 	 	the	 work 	 force 	 	,	and	it	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	us	up	to	our	current	day	.
And	 bas 	 ically 	 	what	you	'll	see	is	what	 economist 	 s 	 	talk	about	 a 	 s 	 	the	 polar 	 ization 	 	of	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	what	 do 	 es 	 	that	mean	?
It	 mean 	 s 	 	that	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	is	 divid 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 high 	 - 	 skill 	 	,	 high 	 - 	 wage 	 	 job 	 s 	 	and	 low 	 - 	 skill 	 	,	 low 	 - 	 wage 	 	 job 	 s 	 	--	and	that	the	middle	,	the	 middle 	 - 	 skill 	 	 job 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 middle 	 - 	 earn 	 ing 	 	 job 	 s 	 	,	are	 start 	 ing 	 	to	drop	out	of	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	going	on	for	40	 year 	 s 	 	now	.
But	 th 	 is 	 	process	is	 affect 	 ing 	 	men	 ver 	 y 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	than	it	's	 affect 	 ing 	 	women	.
You	'll	see	the	women	in	red	,	and	you	'll	see	the	men	in	blue	.
You	'll	watch	them	both	drop	out	of	the	middle	class	,	but	see	what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	women	and	see	what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	men	.
There	we	go	.
So	watch	that	.	You	see	them	both	drop	out	of	the	middle	class	.
 Wat 	 ch 	 	what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	the	women	.	 Wat 	 ch 	 	what	 happen 	 s 	 	to	the	men	.
The	men	sort	of	 stag 	 n 	 ate 	 	there	,	while	the	women	zoom	up	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 high 	 - 	 skill 	 	 job 	 s 	 	.
So	what	's	that	about	?
It	 look 	 s 	 	like	women	got	some	power	boost	on	a	video	game	,	or	like	they	snuck	in	some	secret	 s 	 er 	 um 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 birth 	 - 	 control 	 	 pill 	 s 	 	that	lets	them	shoot	up	high	.
But	of	course	,	it	's	not	about	that	.
What	it	's	about	is	that	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	a	lot	.
We	used	to	have	a	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	which	was	about	building	 good 	 s 	 	and	 product 	 s 	 	,	and	now	we	have	a	service	 eco 	 nomy 	 	and	an	information	and	creative	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
 T 	 hose 	 	two	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	 requir 	 e 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	different	 skill 	 s 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	it	 happen 	 s 	 	,	women	have	 be 	 en 	 	much	better	at	 acquir 	 ing 	 	the	new	set	of	 skill 	 s 	 	than	men	have	 be 	 en 	 	.
It	used	to	be	that	you	 we 	 re 	 	a	guy	who	went	to	high	school	who	did	n't	have	a	college	degree	,	but	you	had	a	specific	set	of	 skill 	 s 	 	,	and	with	the	help	of	a	 un 	 ion 	 	,	you	could	make	 your 	 self 	 	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	 middle 	 - 	 class 	 	life	.
But	that	 re 	 ally 	 	is	n't	true	 any 	 more 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	new	 eco 	 nomy 	 	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	 in 	 different 	 	to	 s 	 ize 	 	and	strength	,	which	is	what	's	 help 	 ed 	 	men	 a 	 long 	 	all	these	 year 	 s 	 	.
What	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	 requir 	 es 	 	now	is	a	whole	different	set	of	 skill 	 s 	 	.
You	 bas 	 ically 	 	need	 intellig 	 ence 	 	,	you	need	an	ability	to	 s 	 it 	 	still	and	focus	,	to	communicate	 open 	 ly 	 	,	to	be	able	to	listen	to	people	and	to	 oper 	 ate 	 	in	a	 work 	 place 	 	that	is	much	more	fluid	than	it	used	to	be	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	are	 thing 	 s 	 	that	women	do	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	well	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	.
If	you	look	at	management	 theor 	 y 	 	these	 day 	 s 	 	,	it	used	to	be	that	our	ideal	 lead 	 er 	 	 sound 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 Gene 	 ral 	 	 Pat 	 ton 	 	,	right	?
You	would	be	 is 	 suing 	 	 order 	 s 	 	from	above	.
You	would	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 hierarch 	 ical 	 	.
You	would	tell	 every 	 one 	 	 be 	 low 	 	you	what	to	do	.
But	that	's	not	what	an	ideal	 lead 	 er 	 	is	like	now	.
If	you	read	management	 book 	 s 	 	now	,	a	 lead 	 er 	 	is	 some 	 body 	 	who	can	foster	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	,	who	can	get	his	--	get	the	 employ 	 ees 	 	--	see	,	I	still	say	``	his	''	--	who	can	get	the	 employ 	 ees 	 	to	talk	to	each	other	,	who	can	 bas 	 ically 	 	build	 team 	 s 	 	and	get	them	to	be	creative	.
And	 t 	 hose 	 	are	all	 thing 	 s 	 	that	women	do	 ver 	 y 	 	well	.
And	then	on	top	of	that	,	that	's	 create 	 d 	 	a	kind	of	 cascad 	 ing 	 	effect	.
Women	enter	the	 work 	 place 	 	at	the	top	,	and	then	at	the	 work 	 ing 	 	class	,	all	the	new	 job 	 s 	 	that	are	 create 	 d 	 	are	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 job 	 s 	 	that	wives	used	to	do	for	free	at	home	.
So	that	's	 child 	 care 	 	,	elder	care	and	food	 pre 	 par 	 ation 	 	.
So	 t 	 hose 	 	are	all	the	 job 	 s 	 	that	are	growing	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	are	 job 	 s 	 	that	women	tend	to	do	.
 N 	 ow 	 	one	day	it	might	be	that	 mother 	 s 	 	will	hire	an	 out 	 - 	 of 	 - 	 work 	 	,	 middle 	 - 	 aged 	 	,	 form 	 er 	 	 steel 	 work 	 er 	 	guy	to	watch	 the 	 ir 	 	children	at	home	,	and	that	would	be	good	for	the	men	,	but	that	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	yet	.
To	see	what	's	going	to	happen	,	you	ca	n't	just	look	at	the	 work 	 force 	 	that	is	now	,	you	have	to	look	at	our	future	 work 	 force 	 	.
And	here	the	story	is	 fair 	 ly 	 	simple	.
Women	are	 get 	 ting 	 	college	 degree 	 s 	 	at	a	 fast 	 er 	 	rate	than	men	.
Why	?	 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	real	 myster 	 y 	 	.
People	have	 ask 	 ed 	 	men	,	why	do	n't	they	just	go	back	to	college	,	to	community	college	,	say	,	and	 re 	 tool 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	learn	a	new	set	of	 skill 	 s 	 	?
Well	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	they	're	just	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 comfort 	 able 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	that	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	used	to	 think 	 ing 	 	of	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 provide 	 rs 	 	,	and	they	ca	n't	seem	to	build	the	social	 network 	 s 	 	that	allow	them	to	get	through	college	.
So	for	some	reason	men	just	do	n't	end	up	going	back	to	college	.
And	what	's	even	more	 disturb 	 ing 	 	is	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	with	 young 	 er 	 	 boy 	 s 	 	.
There	's	 be 	 en 	 	about	a	decade	of	research	about	what	people	are	 call 	 ing 	 	the	``	boy	crisis	.	''
 N 	 ow 	 	the	boy	crisis	is	 th 	 is 	 	idea	that	 ver 	 y 	 	young	 boy 	 s 	 	,	for	 what 	 ever 	 	reason	,	are	 do 	 ing 	 	 wo 	 rse 	 	in	school	than	 ver 	 y 	 	young	 girl 	 s 	 	,	and	people	have	 the 	 ories 	 	about	that	.
 I 	 s 	 	it	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	an	 excess 	 ively 	 	verbal	curriculum	,	and	little	 girl 	 s 	 	are	better	at	that	than	little	 boy 	 s 	 	?
Or	that	we	 requir 	 e 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	to	 s 	 it 	 	still	too	much	,	and	so	 boy 	 s 	 	 initi 	 ally 	 	feel	like	 failure 	 s 	 	?
And	some	people	say	it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	,	in	9th	grade	,	 boy 	 s 	 	start	dropping	out	of	school	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	I	'm	writing	a	book	about	all	 th 	 is 	 	,	I	'm	still	looking	 in 	 to 	 	it	,	so	I	do	n't	have	the	answer	.
But	in	the	mean	time	,	I	'm	going	to	call	on	the	 world 	 wide 	 	education	expert	,	who	's	my	10-year-old	daughter	,	 No 	 ah 	 	,	to	talk	to	you	about	why	the	 boy 	 s 	 	in	her	class	do	 wo 	 rse 	 	.
 No 	 ah 	 	:	The	 girl 	 s 	 	are	 obvious 	 ly 	 	 smart 	 er 	 	.
I	mean	they	have	much	 large 	 r 	 	 vocabul 	 ary 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	learn	much	 fast 	 er 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	are	more	controlled	.
On	the	board	 to 	 day 	 	for	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	recess	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	,	 on 	 ly 	 	 boy 	 s 	 	.
 Han 	 na 	 	 Ro 	 s 	 in 	 	:	And	why	is	that	?
 No 	 ah 	 	:	Why	?	 The 	 y 	 	 we 	 re 	 	just	not	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	the	class	while	the	 girl 	 s 	 	 s 	 at 	 	there	 ver 	 y 	 	 nice 	 ly 	 	.
HR	:	So	there	you	go	.
 Th 	 is 	 	whole	thesis	 re 	 ally 	 	came	home	to	me	when	I	went	to	visit	a	college	in	 K 	 ansas 	 	City	--	 work 	 ing 	 - 	 class 	 	college	.
 Certain 	 ly 	 	,	when	I	was	in	college	,	I	had	certain	 expect 	 ations 	 	about	my	life	--	that	my	husband	and	I	would	both	work	,	and	that	we	would	 equal 	 ly 	 	raise	the	children	.
But	these	college	 girl 	 s 	 	had	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	view	of	 the 	 ir 	 	future	.
 Bas 	 ically 	 	,	the	way	they	 s 	 aid 	 	it	to	me	is	that	they	would	be	 work 	 ing 	 	18	 hour 	 s 	 	a	day	,	that	 the 	 ir 	 	husband	would	 may 	 be 	 	have	a	job	,	but	that	 most 	 ly 	 	he	would	be	at	home	taking	care	of	the	 kid 	 dies 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	was	kind	of	a	 shock 	 er 	 	to	me	.
And	then	here	's	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	quote	from	one	of	the	 girl 	 s 	 	:	``	Men	are	the	new	ball	and	chain	.	''
 N 	 ow 	 	you	laugh	,	but	that	quote	 ha 	 s 	 	kind	of	a	 s 	 ting 	 	to	it	,	right	?
And	I	think	the	reason	it	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 s 	 ting 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	of	 histo 	 ry 	 	do	n't	reverse	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 with 	 out 	 	a	lot	of	pain	,	and	that	's	why	I	talk	about	us	all	going	through	 th 	 is 	 	together	.
The	night	after	I	 talk 	 ed 	 	to	these	college	 girl 	 s 	 	,	I	 al 	 so 	 	went	to	a	men	's	group	in	 K 	 ansas 	 	,	and	these	 we 	 re 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	kind	of	 victim 	 s 	 	of	the	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	which	I	spoke	to	you	about	 ear 	 lier 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	 we 	 re 	 	men	who	had	 be 	 en 	 	 contract 	 ors 	 	,	or	they	had	 be 	 en 	 	building	 house 	 s 	 	and	they	had	lost	 the 	 ir 	 	 job 	 s 	 	after	the	housing	boom	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	group	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 fail 	 ing 	 	to	pay	 the 	 ir 	 	child	support	.
And	the	 instruct 	 or 	 	was	up	there	in	the	class	 explain 	 ing 	 	to	them	all	the	ways	in	which	they	had	lost	 the 	 ir 	 	 ident 	 ity 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	new	age	.
He	was	 tell 	 ing 	 	them	they	no	 long 	 er 	 	had	any	moral	 author 	 ity 	 	,	that	 no 	 body 	 	 need 	 ed 	 	them	for	 emotion 	 al 	 	support	 any 	 more 	 	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	not	 re 	 ally 	 	the	 provide 	 rs 	 	.
So	who	 we 	 re 	 	they	?
And	 th 	 is 	 	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 dis 	 heart 	 en 	 ing 	 	for	them	.
And	what	he	did	was	he	wrote	down	on	the	board	``	$	85,000	,	''	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	That	's	her	 s 	 al 	 ary 	 	,	''	and	then	he	wrote	down	``	$	12,000	.	''
``	That	's	your	 s 	 al 	 ary 	 	.
So	who	's	the	man	now	?	''	he	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	.
``	Who	's	the	damn	man	?
She	's	the	man	now	.	''
And	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 ent 	 	a	shudder	through	the	room	.
And	that	's	part	of	the	reason	I	like	to	talk	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	I	think	it	can	be	 pre 	 tty 	 	 pain 	 ful 	 	,	and	we	 re 	 ally 	 	have	to	work	through	it	.
And	the	other	reason	it	's	kind	of	 urge 	 nt 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	not	just	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	the	 U. 	 S 	 	.
It	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	all	over	the	world	.
In	India	,	poor	women	are	 learn 	 ing 	 	English	 fast 	 er 	 	than	 the 	 ir 	 	male	 counter 	 part 	 s 	 	in	order	to	staff	the	new	call	 center 	 s 	 	that	are	growing	in	India	.
In	China	,	a	lot	of	the	 open 	 ing 	 	up	of	private	 entrepreneur 	 ship 	 	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	women	are	 start 	 ing 	 	 business 	 es 	 	,	small	 business 	 es 	 	,	 fast 	 er 	 	than	men	.
And	here	's	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	which	is	in	South	Korea	.
Over	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 decade 	 s 	 	,	South	Korea	built	one	of	the	most	 patriarch 	 al 	 	 socie 	 ties 	 	we	know	about	.
 The 	 y 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	 enshrin 	 ed 	 	the	 second 	 - 	 class 	 	 stat 	 us 	 	of	women	in	the	civil	code	.
And	if	women	 fail 	 ed 	 	to	birth	male	children	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	 treat 	 ed 	 	like	domestic	 serv 	 ants 	 	.
And	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	family	would	pray	to	the	 spirit 	 s 	 	to	kill	off	a	girl	child	so	they	could	have	a	male	child	.
But	over	the	'70s	and	'80s	,	the	South	Korea	government	 decide 	 d 	 	they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 rapid 	 ly 	 	 industrial 	 ize 	 	,	and	so	what	they	did	was	,	they	 start 	 ed 	 	to	push	women	 in 	 to 	 	the	 work 	 force 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	a	question	since	1985	:	``	How	 strong 	 ly 	 	do	you	prefer	a	 first 	 - 	 born 	 	son	?	''
And	now	look	at	the	chart	.
That	's	from	1985	to	2003	.
How	much	do	you	prefer	a	 first 	 - 	 born 	 	son	?
So	you	can	see	that	these	economic	 change 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	do	have	a	strong	effect	on	our	culture	.
 N 	 ow 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	n't	fully	 process 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	information	,	it	's	kind	of	coming	back	to	us	in	our	pop	culture	in	these	kind	of	weird	and	 exagge 	 rated 	 	ways	,	where	you	can	see	that	the	 stereo 	 type 	 s 	 	are	changing	.
And	so	we	have	on	the	male	side	what	one	of	my	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	 like 	 s 	 	to	call	the	``	 o 	 mega 	 	 male 	 s 	 	''	 pop 	 ping 	 	up	,	who	are	the	 male 	 s 	 	who	are	 romantic 	 ally 	 	 challeng 	 ed 	 	 lose 	 rs 	 	who	ca	n't	find	a	job	.
And	they	come	up	in	 lot 	 s 	 	of	different	 form 	 s 	 	.
So	we	have	the	 perpetu 	 al 	 	adolescent	.
We	have	the	 charm 	 less 	 	 mis 	 anthro 	 pe 	 	.
 Th 	 en 	 	we	have	our	Bud	Light	guy	who	's	the	happy	couch	potato	.
And	then	here	's	a	 shock 	 er 	 	:	even	America	's	most	 s 	 ex 	 iest 	 	man	 al 	 ive 	 	,	the	 s 	 ex 	 iest 	 	man	 al 	 ive 	 	 get 	 s 	 	 romantic 	 ally 	 	 play 	 ed 	 	these	 day 	 s 	 	in	a	movie	.
And	then	on	the	female	side	,	you	have	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	,	in	which	you	have	these	crazy	 super 	 hero 	 	women	.
You	've	got	 Lad 	 y 	 	Gaga	.
You	've	got	our	new	 Jam 	 es 	 	Bond	,	who	's	 Angel 	 ina 	 	 Jo 	 lie 	 	.
And	it	's	not	just	for	the	young	,	right	?
Even	Helen	 Mir 	 ren 	 	can	hold	a	gun	these	 day 	 s 	 	.
And	so	it	 feel 	 s 	 	like	we	have	to	move	from	 th 	 is 	 	place	where	we	've	got	these	 uber 	 - 	 exagge 	 rated 	 	 image 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 feel 	 s 	 	a	little	more	normal	.
So	for	a	long	time	in	the	economic	sphere	,	we	've	lived	with	the	term	``	glass	 ceil 	 ing 	 	.	''
 N 	 ow 	 	I	've	never	 re 	 ally 	 	 like 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	term	.
For	one	thing	,	it	 put 	 s 	 	men	and	women	in	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 ant 	 agon 	 istic 	 	relationship	with	one	 an 	 other 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	men	are	these	 dev 	 ious 	 	 trick 	 sters 	 	up	there	who	've	put	up	 th 	 is 	 	glass	 ceil 	 ing 	 	.
And	we	're	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 low 	 	the	glass	 ceil 	 ing 	 	,	the	women	.
And	we	have	a	lot	of	skill	and	experience	,	but	it	's	a	trick	,	so	how	are	you	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	 prep 	 are 	 	to	get	through	that	glass	 ceil 	 ing 	 	?
And	 al 	 so 	 	,	``	 shatter 	 ing 	 	the	glass	 ceil 	 ing 	 	''	is	a	 terr 	 ible 	 	phrase	.
would	pop	 the 	 ir 	 	head	through	a	glass	 ceil 	 ing 	 	?
So	the	image	that	I	like	to	think	of	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	glass	 ceil 	 ing 	 	,	is	the	high	bridge	.
It	's	 definite 	 ly 	 	 terrify 	 ing 	 	to	stand	at	the	foot	of	a	high	bridge	,	but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	 exhila 	 rating 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 beaut 	 iful 	 	up	there	,	and	you	're	looking	out	on	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	view	.
And	the	great	thing	is	there	's	no	trick	like	with	the	glass	 ceil 	 ing 	 	.
There	's	no	man	or	woman	 stand 	 ing 	 	in	the	middle	about	to	cut	the	 cable 	 s 	 	.
There	's	no	hole	in	the	middle	that	you	're	going	to	fall	through	.
And	the	great	thing	is	that	you	can	take	 any 	 one 	 	 a 	 long 	 	with	you	.
You	can	 br 	 ing 	 	your	husband	 a 	 long 	 	.
You	can	 br 	 ing 	 	your	 friend 	 s 	 	,	or	your	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	,	or	your	babysitter	to	walk	 a 	 long 	 	with	you	.
And	 husband 	 s 	 	can	drag	 the 	 ir 	 	wives	 a 	 cross 	 	,	if	 the 	 ir 	 	wives	do	n't	feel	ready	.
But	the	point	about	the	high	bridge	is	that	you	have	to	have	the	confidence	to	know	that	you	deserve	to	be	on	that	bridge	,	that	you	have	all	the	 skill 	 s 	 	and	experience	you	need	in	order	to	walk	 a 	 cross 	 	the	high	bridge	,	but	you	just	have	to	make	the	decision	to	take	the	first	step	and	do	it	.
 Thank 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.

 Lea 	 h 	 	 Buech 	 ley 	 	:	How	to	 “ 	 sketch 	 ” 	 	with	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 
 To 	 day 	 	,	I	'm	going	to	talk	to	you	about	 sketch 	 ing 	 	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	.
I	'm	,	among	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	other	 thing 	 s 	 	,	an	 electric 	 al 	 	engineer	,	and	that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	I	 s 	 pend 	 	a	good	amount	of	time	 design 	 ing 	 	and	building	new	 piece 	 s 	 	of	technology	,	and	more	 specific 	 ally 	 	 design 	 ing 	 	and	building	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	.
And	what	I	've	found	is	that	the	process	of	 design 	 ing 	 	and	building	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	is	 problem 	 atic 	 	in	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	ways	.
So	it	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 low 	 	process	,	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	expensive	,	and	the	 out 	 come 	 	of	that	process	,	 name 	 ly 	 	 electron 	 ic 	 	circuit	 board 	 s 	 	,	are	 limit 	 ed 	 	in	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	kind	of	 interest 	 ing 	 	ways	.
So	they	're	 re 	 ally 	 	small	,	 general 	 ly 	 	,	they	're	square	and	flat	and	hard	,	and	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	most	of	them	just	are	n't	 ver 	 y 	 	 attract 	 ive 	 	,	and	so	my	team	and	I	have	 be 	 en 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	of	ways	to	 re 	 ally 	 	change	and	mix	up	the	process	and	the	 out 	 come 	 	of	 design 	 ing 	 	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	.
And	so	what	if	you	could	design	and	build	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	?	So	what	if	you	could	do	it	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 in 	 expensive 	 ly 	 	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	more	 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 fluid 	 ly 	 	and	 express 	 ively 	 	and	even	 improvisation 	 ally 	 	?
Would	n't	that	be	so	cool	,	and	that	would	n't	that	open	up	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	new	 possibil 	 ities 	 	?
I	'm	going	to	share	with	you	two	 project 	 s 	 	that	are	 investigation 	 s 	 	 a 	 long 	 	these	lines	,	and	we	'll	start	with	 th 	 is 	 	one	.
 Mag 	 netic 	 	 electron 	 ic 	 	 piece 	 s 	 	and	 ferr 	 ous 	 	paper	.
A	 conduct 	 ive 	 	pen	from	the	 Le 	 wis 	 	lab	at	 UI 	 UC 	 	.
 Stick 	 er 	 	 template 	 s 	 	.
Speed	x	4	.
 Ma 	 king 	 	a	 s 	 witch 	 	.
Music	:	DJ	 Sha 	 d 	 ow 	 	.
 Add 	 ing 	 	some	 intellig 	 ence 	 	with	a	 micro 	 controll 	 er 	 	.
 Sketch 	 ing 	 	an	 inter 	 face 	 	.
 Pre 	 tty 	 	cool	,	huh	?	We	think	so	.
So	now	that	we	 develop 	 ed 	 	these	 tool 	 s 	 	and	found	these	 material 	 s 	 	that	let	us	do	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	we	 start 	 ed 	 	to	 real 	 ize 	 	that	,	 essential 	 ly 	 	,	 any 	 thing 	 	that	we	can	do	with	paper	,	 any 	 thing 	 	that	we	can	do	with	a	piece	of	paper	and	a	pen	we	can	now	do	with	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	.
So	the	next	project	that	I	want	to	show	you	is	kind	of	a	 deep 	 er 	 	exploration	of	that	 possibil 	 ity 	 	.
And	I	'll	kind	of	let	it	speak	for	 it 	 self 	 	.
So	the	next	step	for	us	in	 th 	 is 	 	process	is	now	to	find	a	way	to	let	all	of	you	build	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	so	the	way	that	we	're	 approach 	 ing 	 	that	is	by	 teach 	 ing 	 	 work 	 shop 	 s 	 	to	people	where	we	explain	how	they	can	use	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 tool 	 s 	 	,	and	then	 al 	 so 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	to	get	the	 tool 	 s 	 	and	the	 material 	 s 	 	and	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	out	 in 	 to 	 	the	real	world	in	a	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	ways	.
And	so	 some 	 time 	 	soon	,	you	'll	be	able	to	play	and	build	and	sketch	with	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	new	way	.
So	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.

 Han 	 s 	 	 Ro 	 s 	 ling 	 	on	global	population	growth
I	still	remember	the	day	in	school	when	our	teacher	told	us	that	the	world	population	had	 be 	 come 	 	three	billion	people	,	and	that	was	in	1960	.
I	'm	going	to	talk	now	about	how	world	population	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	from	that	year	and	 in 	 to 	 	the	future	,	but	I	will	not	use	digital	technology	,	 a 	 s 	 	I	've	 d 	 one 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	my	first	five	 TED 	 Talk 	 s 	 	.
 In 	 stead 	 	,	I	have	 progress 	 ed 	 	,	and	I	am	,	 to 	 day 	 	,	 launch 	 ing 	 	a	brand	new	analog	 teach 	 ing 	 	technology	that	I	 pick 	 ed 	 	up	from	IKEA	:	 th 	 is 	 	box	.
 Th 	 is 	 	box	 contain 	 s 	 	one	billion	people	.
And	our	teacher	told	us	that	the	 industrial 	 ized 	 	world	,	1960	,	had	one	billion	people	.
In	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	,	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	they	had	two	billion	people	.
And	they	lived	away	then	.
There	was	a	big	gap	between	the	one	billion	in	the	 industrial 	 ized 	 	world	and	the	two	billion	in	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	.
In	the	 industrial 	 ized 	 	world	,	people	 we 	 re 	 	 health 	 y 	 	,	educated	,	rich	,	and	they	had	small	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	.
And	 the 	 ir 	 	 aspir 	 ation 	 	was	to	buy	a	car	.
And	in	1960	,	all	 Swede 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	saving	to	try	to	buy	a	Volvo	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	was	the	economic	level	at	which	 Swede 	 n 	 	was	.
But	in	contrast	to	 th 	 is 	 	,	in	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	,	far	away	,	the	 aspir 	 ation 	 	of	the	average	family	there	was	to	have	food	for	the	day	.
 The 	 y 	 	 we 	 re 	 	saving	to	be	able	to	buy	a	pair	of	 shoe 	 s 	 	.
There	was	an	enormous	gap	in	the	world	when	I	grew	up	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	gap	between	the	West	and	the	rest	 ha 	 s 	 	 create 	 d 	 	a	 mind 	 set 	 	of	the	world	,	which	we	still	use	 linguist 	 ically 	 	when	we	talk	about	``	the	West	''	and	``	the	 Develop 	 ing 	 	World	.	''
But	the	world	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	,	and	it	's	 over 	 due 	 	to	 up 	 grade 	 	that	 mind 	 set 	 	and	that	 tax 	 o 	 nomy 	 	of	the	world	,	and	to	understand	it	.
And	that	's	what	I	'm	going	to	show	you	,	 be 	 cause 	 	since	1960	what	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	world	up	to	2010	is	that	a	 stagger 	 ing 	 	four	billion	people	have	 be 	 en 	 	 add 	 ed 	 	to	the	world	population	.
Just	look	how	 man 	 y 	 	.
The	world	population	 ha 	 s 	 	 double 	 d 	 	since	I	went	to	school	.
And	of	course	,	there	's	 be 	 en 	 	economic	growth	in	the	West	.
A	lot	of	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	have	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	grow	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	so	the	Western	population	 move 	 d 	 	over	to	here	.
And	now	 the 	 ir 	 	 aspir 	 ation 	 	is	not	 on 	 ly 	 	to	have	a	car	.
 N 	 ow 	 	they	want	to	have	a	 holi 	 day 	 	on	a	 ver 	 y 	 	remote	destination	and	they	want	to	fly	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	they	are	 to 	 day 	 	.
And	the	most	 success 	 ful 	 	of	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	,	they	have	 move 	 d 	 	on	,	you	know	,	and	they	have	 be 	 come 	 	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	,	we	call	them	.
 The 	 y 	 	are	now	 buy 	 ing 	 	 car 	 s 	 	.
And	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	a	month	ago	was	that	the	 Chi 	 nese 	 	company	,	 Gee 	 ly 	 	,	they	 acquir 	 ed 	 	the	Volvo	company	,	and	then	 final 	 ly 	 	the	 Swede 	 s 	 	 under 	 stood 	 	that	 some 	 thing 	 	big	had	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	world	.
So	there	they	are	.
And	the	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	is	that	the	two	billion	over	here	that	is	 st 	 rug 	 gling 	 	for	food	and	 shoe 	 s 	 	,	they	are	still	 al 	 most 	 	 a 	 s 	 	poor	 a 	 s 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	50	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
The	new	thing	is	that	we	have	the	 big 	 gest 	 	pile	of	 billion 	 s 	 	,	the	three	 billion 	 s 	 	here	,	which	are	 al 	 so 	 	 be 	 coming 	 	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	are	 quit 	 e 	 	 health 	 y 	 	,	 relat 	 ively 	 	 well 	 - 	 educated 	 	,	and	they	 al 	 ready 	 	 al 	 so 	 	have	two	to	three	children	per	woman	,	 a 	 s 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	[	 rich 	 er 	 	 al 	 so 	 	]	have	.
And	 the 	 ir 	 	 aspir 	 ation 	 	now	is	,	of	course	,	to	buy	a	 bi 	 cycle 	 	,	and	then	 lat 	 er 	 	on	they	would	like	to	have	a	 motor 	 bike 	 	 al 	 so 	 	.
But	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	world	we	have	 to 	 day 	 	,	no	 long 	 er 	 	any	gap	.
But	the	distance	from	the	 poor 	 est 	 	here	,	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 poor 	 est 	 	,	to	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 rich 	 est 	 	over	here	is	 wide 	 r 	 	than	ever	.
But	there	is	a	 continu 	 ous 	 	world	from	 walk 	 ing 	 	,	 bi 	 king 	 	,	 driv 	 ing 	 	,	 fly 	 ing 	 	--	there	are	people	on	all	 level 	 s 	 	,	and	most	people	tend	to	be	 some 	 where 	 	in	the	middle	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	new	world	we	have	 to 	 day 	 	in	2010	.
And	what	will	happen	in	the	future	?
Well	,	I	'm	going	to	project	 in 	 to 	 	2050	.
I	was	in	 Sha 	 n 	 ghai 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	and	I	 listen 	 ed 	 	to	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	China	,	and	it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	that	they	will	catch	up	,	just	 a 	 s 	 	Japan	did	.
All	the	 project 	 ions 	 	[	say	that	]	 th 	 is 	 	one	[	billion	]	will	[	 on 	 ly 	 	]	grow	with	one	to	two	or	three	percent	.
[	But	 th 	 is 	 	second	]	 grow 	 s 	 	with	seven	,	eight	percent	,	and	then	they	will	end	up	here	.
 The 	 y 	 	will	start	 fly 	 ing 	 	.
And	these	lower	or	middle	income	 count 	 ries 	 	,	the	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	income	 count 	 ries 	 	,	they	will	 al 	 so 	 	 for 	 ge 	 	 forward 	 s 	 	 economic 	 ally 	 	.
And	if	,	but	 on 	 ly 	 	if	,	we	invest	in	the	right	green	technology	--	so	that	we	can	avoid	severe	climate	change	,	and	energy	can	still	be	 relat 	 ively 	 	cheap	--	then	they	will	move	all	the	way	up	here	.
And	they	will	start	to	buy	electric	 car 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	will	find	there	.
So	what	about	the	 poor 	 est 	 	two	billion	?
What	about	the	 poor 	 est 	 	two	billion	here	?
Will	they	move	on	?
Well	,	here	population	[	growth	]	 come 	 s 	 	in	 be 	 cause 	 	there	[	among	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	]	we	 al 	 ready 	 	have	two	to	three	children	per	woman	,	family	 plan 	 ning 	 	is	 wide 	 ly 	 	used	,	and	population	growth	is	coming	to	an	end	.
 He 	 re 	 	[	among	the	 poor 	 est 	 	]	,	population	is	growing	.
So	these	[	 poor 	 est 	 	]	two	billion	will	,	in	the	next	 decade 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 crease 	 	to	three	billion	,	and	they	will	 there 	 after 	 	 in 	 crease 	 	to	four	billion	.
There	is	 noth 	 ing 	 	--	but	a	nuclear	war	of	a	kind	we	've	never	 s 	 een 	 	--	that	can	stop	 th 	 is 	 	[	growth	]	from	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	we	 al 	 ready 	 	have	 th 	 is 	 	[	growth	]	in	process	.
But	if	,	and	 on 	 ly 	 	if	,	[	the	 poor 	 est 	 	]	get	out	of	poverty	,	they	get	education	,	they	get	 improv 	 ed 	 	child	 surviv 	 al 	 	,	they	can	buy	a	 bi 	 cycle 	 	and	a	cell	phone	and	come	[	to	live	]	here	,	then	population	growth	will	stop	in	2050	.
We	can	not	have	people	on	 th 	 is 	 	level	looking	for	food	and	 shoe 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	then	we	get	 continu 	 ed 	 	population	growth	.
And	let	me	show	you	why	by	 convert 	 ing 	 	back	to	the	 old 	 - 	 time 	 	digital	technology	.
 He 	 re 	 	I	have	on	the	screen	my	country	 bubble 	 s 	 	.
Every	bubble	is	a	country	.	The	 s 	 ize 	 	is	population	.
The	 color 	 s 	 	show	the	continent	.
The	yellow	on	there	is	the	 America 	 s 	 	;	dark	blue	is	 Afri 	 ca 	 	;	 brow 	 n 	 	is	 Euro 	 pe 	 	;	green	is	the	Middle	East	and	 th 	 is 	 	light	blue	is	South	Asia	.
That	's	India	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	China	.	 S 	 ize 	 	is	population	.
 He 	 re 	 	I	have	children	per	woman	:	two	children	,	four	children	,	six	children	,	eight	children	--	big	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	,	small	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	.
The	year	is	1960	.
And	down	here	,	child	 surviv 	 al 	 	,	the	 percent 	 age 	 	of	children	 surviv 	 ing 	 	 child 	 hood 	 	up	to	 start 	 ing 	 	school	:	60	percent	,	70	percent	,	80	percent	,	90	,	and	 al 	 most 	 	100	percent	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	have	 to 	 day 	 	in	the	 wealth 	 iest 	 	and	 health 	 iest 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	.
But	look	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	world	my	teacher	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	in	1960	:	one	billion	Western	world	here	--	high	 child 	 - 	 surviv 	 al 	 	,	small	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	--	and	all	the	rest	,	the	 rain 	 bow 	 	of	 develop 	 ing 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	,	with	 ver 	 y 	 	large	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	and	poor	child	 surviv 	 al 	 	.
What	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	?	I	start	the	world	.	 He 	 re 	 	we	go	.
Can	you	see	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	 year 	 s 	 	pass	by	,	child	 surviv 	 al 	 	is	increasing	?
 The 	 y 	 	get	soap	,	 hygien 	 e 	 	,	education	,	 vaccin 	 ation 	 	,	 pen 	 icillin 	 	and	then	family	 plan 	 ning 	 	.	 Fam 	 ily 	 	 s 	 ize 	 	is	 decr 	 eas 	 ing 	 	.
[	When	]	they	get	up	to	90-percent	child	 surviv 	 al 	 	,	then	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	 de 	 crease 	 	,	and	most	of	the	Arab	 count 	 ries 	 	in	the	Middle	East	is	 fall 	 ing 	 	down	there	[	to	small	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	]	.
Look	,	 Bang 	 lad 	 esh 	 	 catch 	 ing 	 	up	with	India	.
The	whole	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	world	 join 	 s 	 	the	Western	world	with	good	child	 surviv 	 al 	 	and	small	family	 s 	 ize 	 	,	but	we	still	have	the	 poor 	 est 	 	billion	.
Can	you	see	the	 poor 	 est 	 	billion	,	 t 	 hose 	 	[	two	]	boxes	I	had	over	here	?
 The 	 y 	 	are	still	up	here	.
And	they	still	have	a	child	 surviv 	 al 	 	of	 on 	 ly 	 	70	to	80	percent	,	meaning	that	if	you	have	six	children	born	,	there	will	be	at	 l 	 east 	 	four	who	 surviv 	 e 	 	to	the	next	generation	.
And	the	population	will	double	in	one	generation	.
So	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	of	 re 	 ally 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	world	population	[	growth	]	to	stop	is	to	 continu 	 e 	 	to	improve	child	 surviv 	 al 	 	to	90	percent	.
That	's	why	 invest 	 ments 	 	by	 Gate 	 s 	 	 Found 	 ation 	 	,	 UN 	 ICE 	 F 	 	and	aid	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	,	together	with	national	government	in	the	 poor 	 est 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	,	are	so	good	;	 be 	 cause 	 	they	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 help 	 ing 	 	us	to	reach	a	 sustain 	 able 	 	population	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	world	.
We	can	stop	at	nine	billion	if	we	do	the	right	 thing 	 s 	 	.
Child	 surviv 	 al 	 	is	the	new	green	.
It	's	 on 	 ly 	 	by	child	 surviv 	 al 	 	that	we	will	stop	population	growth	.
And	will	it	happen	?
Well	,	I	'm	not	an	optimist	,	 n 	 either 	 	am	I	a	 pessim 	 ist 	 	.
I	'm	a	 ver 	 y 	 	serious	``	 possibil 	 ist 	 	.	''
It	's	a	new	 categor 	 y 	 	where	we	take	emotion	 a 	 part 	 	,	and	we	just	work	 analytic 	 ally 	 	with	the	world	.
It	can	be	 d 	 one 	 	.
We	can	have	a	much	more	just	world	.
With	green	technology	and	with	 invest 	 ments 	 	to	 allevi 	 ate 	 	poverty	,	and	global	 govern 	 ance 	 	,	the	world	can	 be 	 come 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
And	look	at	the	position	of	the	old	West	.
 Re 	 member 	 	when	 th 	 is 	 	blue	box	was	all	 al 	 one 	 	,	 lead 	 ing 	 	the	world	,	living	 it 	 s 	 	own	life	.
 Th 	 is 	 	will	not	happen	[	 aga 	 in 	 	]	.
The	role	of	the	old	West	in	the	new	world	is	to	 be 	 come 	 	the	 found 	 ation 	 	of	the	modern	world	--	 noth 	 ing 	 	more	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	less	.
But	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	role	.
Do	it	well	and	get	used	to	it	.
Thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.

 Stefan 	 a 	 	 Broad 	 bent 	 	:	How	the	Internet	 en 	 able 	 s 	 	 in 	 timacy 	 
I	 believ 	 e 	 	that	there	are	new	,	 hid 	 den 	 	 tension 	 s 	 	that	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	between	people	and	 institution 	 s 	 	--	 institution 	 s 	 	that	are	the	 institution 	 s 	 	that	people	inhabit	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 dai 	 ly 	 	life	:	 school 	 s 	 	,	 hospital 	 s 	 	,	 work 	 place 	 s 	 	,	 factor 	 ies 	 	,	 off 	 ice 	 s 	 	,	etc	.
And	 some 	 thing 	 	that	I	see	 happen 	 ing 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	I	would	like	to	call	a	sort	of	``	 democrat 	 ization 	 	of	 in 	 timacy 	 	.	''
And	what	do	I	mean	by	that	?
I	mean	that	what	people	are	 do 	 ing 	 	is	,	in	fact	,	they	are	sort	of	,	with	 the 	 ir 	 	communication	 channel 	 s 	 	,	they	are	 break 	 ing 	 	an	 impose 	 d 	 	 isol 	 ation 	 	that	these	 institution 	 s 	 	are	 im 	 posing 	 	on	them	.
How	are	they	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	?	 The 	 y 	 	're	 do 	 ing 	 	it	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	way	,	by	 call 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	mom	from	work	,	by	 IM 	 ing 	 	from	 the 	 ir 	 	 off 	 ice 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 friend 	 s 	 	,	by	 text 	 ing 	 	under	the	desk	.
The	 picture 	 s 	 	that	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	me	are	people	that	I	 visit 	 ed 	 	in	the	last	few	 month 	 s 	 	.
And	I	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	to	come	 a 	 long 	 	with	the	person	they	communicate	with	most	.
And	 some 	 body 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	a	boyfriend	,	 some 	 body 	 	a	father	.
One	young	woman	 br 	 ought 	 	her	 grand 	 father 	 	.
For	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	I	've	 be 	 en 	 	looking	at	how	people	use	 channel 	 s 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	email	,	the	mobile	phone	,	 text 	 ing 	 	,	etc	.
What	we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	going	to	see	is	that	,	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	,	people	are	 commun 	 ic 	 ating 	 	on	a	regular	 bas 	 is 	 	with	five	,	six	,	seven	of	 the 	 ir 	 	most	 intima 	 te 	 	sphere	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	lets	take	some	data	.	Facebook	.
 Re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	some	 socio 	 logists 	 	from	Facebook	--	Facebook	is	the	channel	that	you	would	expect	is	the	most	 enlarg 	 en 	 ing 	 	of	all	 channel 	 s 	 	.
And	an	average	user	,	 s 	 aid 	 	 Cam 	 er 	 on 	 	 Mar 	 low 	 	,	from	Facebook	,	 ha 	 s 	 	about	120	 friend 	 s 	 	.
But	he	 actual 	 ly 	 	 talk 	 s 	 	to	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 two 	 - 	 way 	 	 ex 	 change 	 s 	 	with	,	about	four	to	six	people	on	a	regular	base	,	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	his	gender	.
 A 	 ca 	 demic 	 	research	on	instant	 mess 	 aging 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 show 	 s 	 	100	people	on	 bud 	 dy 	 	 list 	 s 	 	,	but	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	people	chat	with	two	,	three	,	four	--	 any 	 way 	 	,	less	than	five	.
My	own	research	on	 cell 	 phone 	 s 	 	and	voice	 call 	 s 	 	 show 	 s 	 	that	80	percent	of	the	 call 	 s 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	made	to	four	people	.	80	percent	.
And	when	you	go	to	 Sky 	 pe 	 	,	it	's	down	to	two	people	.
A	lot	of	 socio 	 logists 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	are	 quit 	 e 	 	 disappoint 	 ed 	 	.
I	mean	,	I	've	 be 	 en 	 	a	bit	 disappoint 	 ed 	 	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	when	I	saw	 th 	 is 	 	data	and	all	 th 	 is 	 	 deploy 	 ment 	 	,	just	for	five	people	.
And	some	 socio 	 logists 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	feel	that	it	's	a	closure	,	it	's	a	 cocoon 	 ing 	 	,	that	we	're	 dis 	 engag 	 ing 	 	from	the	public	.
And	I	would	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	I	would	like	to	show	you	that	if	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	look	at	who	is	 do 	 ing 	 	it	,	and	from	where	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	it	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	there	is	an	 in 	 credible 	 	social	 transform 	 ation 	 	.
There	are	three	 st 	 ories 	 	that	I	think	are	 quit 	 e 	 	good	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.
The	first	 gentle 	 man 	 	,	he	's	a	 bake 	 r 	 	.
And	so	he	 start 	 s 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	every	 morn 	 ing 	 	at	four	 o 	 ' 	 clock 	 	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
And	around	eight	 o 	 ' 	 clock 	 	he	sort	of	 sneak 	 s 	 	away	from	his	oven	,	 clean 	 s 	 	his	 hand 	 s 	 	from	the	flour	and	 call 	 s 	 	his	wife	.
He	just	 want 	 s 	 	to	wish	her	a	good	day	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	the	start	of	her	day	.
And	I	've	heard	 th 	 is 	 	story	a	number	of	 time 	 s 	 	.
A	young	 factor 	 y 	 	 work 	 er 	 	who	 work 	 s 	 	night	 shift 	 s 	 	,	who	 manage 	 s 	 	to	sneak	away	from	the	 factor 	 y 	 	floor	,	where	there	is	 CC 	 TV 	 	by	the	way	,	and	find	a	corner	,	where	at	11	 o 	 ' 	 clock 	 	at	night	he	can	call	his	girlfriend	and	just	say	 good 	 night 	 	.
Or	a	mother	who	,	at	four	 o 	 ' 	 clock 	 	,	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 manage 	 s 	 	to	find	a	corner	in	the	toilet	to	check	that	her	children	are	 safe 	 ly 	 	home	.
 Th 	 en 	 	there	is	 an 	 other 	 	couple	,	there	is	a	 Brazil 	 ian 	 	couple	.
 The 	 y 	 	've	lived	in	 It 	 a 	 ly 	 	for	a	number	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	 Sky 	 pe 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	a	few	 time 	 s 	 	a	week	.
But	once	a	 fort 	 night 	 	,	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	put	the	computer	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 din 	 ing 	 	table	,	pull	out	the	 web 	 cam 	 	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	 d 	 inner 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	family	in	 Sa 	 o 	 	 Paul 	 o 	 	.	And	they	have	a	big	event	of	it	.
And	I	heard	 th 	 is 	 	story	the	first	time	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	from	a	 ver 	 y 	 	modest	family	of	 im 	 migrant 	 s 	 	from	Kosovo	in	 Switzer 	 land 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	had	set	up	a	big	screen	in	 the 	 ir 	 	living	room	,	and	every	 morn 	 ing 	 	they	had	 break 	 fast 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 grand 	 mother 	 	.
But	 Dan 	 ny 	 	 Mill 	 er 	 	,	who	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 anthropo 	 logist 	 	who	is	 work 	 ing 	 	on	Filipina	migrant	women	who	 leav 	 e 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	children	back	in	the	 Philip 	 pine 	 s 	 	,	was	 tell 	 ing 	 	me	about	how	much	 parent 	 ing 	 	is	going	on	through	 Sky 	 pe 	 	,	and	how	much	these	 mother 	 s 	 	are	 engag 	 ed 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	children	through	 Sky 	 pe 	 	.
And	then	there	is	the	third	couple	.	 The 	 y 	 	are	two	 friend 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	chat	to	each	other	every	day	,	a	few	 time 	 s 	 	a	day	 actual 	 ly 	 	.
And	 final 	 ly 	 	,	 final 	 ly 	 	,	they	've	 manage 	 d 	 	to	put	instant	 mess 	 aging 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	at	work	.
And	now	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	they	have	it	open	.
 When 	 ever 	 	they	have	a	moment	they	chat	to	each	other	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	with	 teenager 	 s 	 	and	 kid 	 s 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	it	in	school	,	under	the	table	,	and	 text 	 ing 	 	under	the	table	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 friend 	 s 	 	.
So	,	 non 	 e 	 	of	these	 case 	 s 	 	are	 un 	 ique 	 	.
I	mean	,	I	could	tell	you	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	them	.
But	what	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 exception 	 al 	 	is	the	setting	.
So	,	think	of	the	three	 setting 	 s 	 	I	've	 talk 	 ed 	 	to	you	about	:	 factor 	 y 	 	,	 migr 	 ation 	 	,	 off 	 ice 	 	.
But	it	could	be	in	a	school	,	it	could	be	an	 administr 	 ation 	 	,	it	could	be	a	hospital	.
Three	 setting 	 s 	 	that	,	if	we	just	step	back	15	 year 	 s 	 	,	if	you	just	think	back	15	 year 	 s 	 	,	when	you	 clock 	 ed 	 	in	,	when	you	 clock 	 ed 	 	in	to	an	 off 	 ice 	 	,	when	you	 clock 	 ed 	 	in	to	a	 factor 	 y 	 	,	there	was	no	contact	for	the	whole	 dur 	 ation 	 	of	the	time	,	there	was	no	contact	with	your	private	sphere	.
If	you	 we 	 re 	 	 luck 	 y 	 	there	was	a	public	phone	 hang 	 ing 	 	in	the	corridor	or	 some 	 where 	 	.
If	you	 we 	 re 	 	in	management	,	oh	,	that	was	a	different	story	.
 May 	 be 	 	you	had	a	direct	line	.
If	you	 we 	 re 	 	not	,	you	 may 	 be 	 	had	to	go	through	an	 oper 	 ator 	 	.
But	 bas 	 ically 	 	,	when	you	 walk 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 building 	 s 	 	,	the	private	sphere	was	left	 be 	 hind 	 	you	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	a	norm	of	our	professional	 live 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	a	norm	and	 s 	 uch 	 	an	 expect 	 ation 	 	.
And	it	had	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	technical	 cap 	 ability 	 	.
The	 phone 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	there	.	But	the	 expect 	 ation 	 	was	once	you	 move 	 d 	 	in	there	your	 commit 	 ment 	 	was	fully	to	the	task	at	hand	,	fully	to	the	people	around	you	.
That	was	where	the	focus	had	to	be	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	a	cultural	norm	that	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	school	our	children	for	them	to	be	 cap 	 able 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	 clea 	 vage 	 	.
If	you	think	 nurse 	 ry 	 	,	 kind 	 ergarten 	 	,	first	 year 	 s 	 	of	school	are	just	 dedicate 	 d 	 	to	take	away	the	children	,	to	make	them	used	to	 stay 	 ing 	 	long	 hour 	 s 	 	away	from	 the 	 ir 	 	family	.
And	then	the	school	 enact 	 s 	 	 perfect 	 ly 	 	well	.
It	 mimic 	 s 	 	 perfect 	 ly 	 	all	the	 ritual 	 s 	 	that	we	will	find	in	 off 	 ice 	 s 	 	:	 ritual 	 s 	 	of	entry	,	 ritual 	 s 	 	of	exit	,	the	 schedule 	 s 	 	,	the	 uniform 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	,	 thing 	 s 	 	that	identify	you	,	 team 	 - 	 building 	 	 activ 	 ities 	 	,	team	building	that	will	allow	you	to	 bas 	 ically 	 	be	with	a	random	group	of	 kid 	 s 	 	,	or	a	random	group	of	people	that	you	will	have	to	be	with	for	a	number	of	time	.
And	of	course	,	the	major	thing	:	learn	to	pay	attention	,	to	 concent 	 rate 	 	and	focus	your	attention	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	about	150	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
It	 on 	 ly 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	with	the	birth	of	modern	 bureau 	 cracy 	 	,	and	of	industrial	revolution	.
When	people	 bas 	 ically 	 	had	to	go	 some 	 where 	 	else	to	work	and	carry	out	the	work	.
And	when	with	modern	 bureau 	 cracy 	 	there	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	rational	approach	,	where	there	was	a	clear	 distinct 	 ion 	 	between	the	private	sphere	and	the	public	sphere	.
So	,	 un 	 til 	 	then	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	people	 we 	 re 	 	living	on	top	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 trade 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	 we 	 re 	 	living	on	top	of	the	land	they	 we 	 re 	 	 labor 	 ing 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	 we 	 re 	 	living	on	top	of	the	 work 	 shop 	 s 	 	where	they	 we 	 re 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	.
And	if	you	think	,	it	's	 permeate 	 d 	 	our	whole	culture	,	even	our	cities	.
If	you	think	of	 med 	 ieval 	 	cities	,	 med 	 ieval 	 	cities	the	 bo 	 rough 	 s 	 	all	have	the	 name 	 s 	 	of	the	 guild 	 s 	 	and	 profession 	 s 	 	that	lived	there	.
 N 	 ow 	 	we	have	 sprawl 	 ing 	 	 resident 	 ial 	 	 suburb 	 ia 	 s 	 	that	are	well	distinct	from	production	 area 	 s 	 	and	commercial	 area 	 s 	 	.
And	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	over	these	150	 year 	 s 	 	,	there	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	clear	class	system	that	 al 	 so 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 emerge 	 d 	 	.
So	the	lower	the	 stat 	 us 	 	of	the	job	and	of	the	person	 carry 	 ing 	 	out	,	the	more	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	he	would	be	from	his	personal	sphere	.
People	have	taken	 th 	 is 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	in	contact	all	through	the	day	or	in	all	 type 	 s 	 	of	 situ 	 ations 	 	.
And	they	are	 do 	 ing 	 	it	 massive 	 ly 	 	.
The	 Pe 	 w 	 	Institute	,	which	 produce 	 s 	 	good	data	on	a	regular	 bas 	 is 	 	on	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	in	the	 Stat 	 es 	 	,	 say 	 s 	 	that	--	and	I	think	that	 th 	 is 	 	number	is	 conserv 	 ative 	 	--	50	percent	of	 any 	 body 	 	with	email	access	at	work	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	private	email	from	his	 off 	 ice 	 	.
I	 re 	 ally 	 	think	that	the	number	is	 conserv 	 ative 	 	.
In	my	own	research	,	we	saw	that	the	peak	for	private	email	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	11	 o 	 ' 	 clock 	 	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	 what 	 ever 	 	the	country	.
75	percent	of	people	admit	 do 	 ing 	 	private	 conversation 	 s 	 	from	work	on	 the 	 ir 	 	mobile	 phone 	 s 	 	.
100	percent	are	using	text	.
The	point	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 - 	 appropri 	 ation 	 	of	the	personal	sphere	is	not	 terr 	 ibly 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	with	all	 institution 	 s 	 	.
I	'm	 al 	 ways 	 	 surprise 	 d 	 	the	U.S.	 Arm 	 y 	 	 socio 	 logists 	 	are	 discuss 	 ing 	 	of	the	impact	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	of	 soldier 	 s 	 	in	Iraq	 hav 	 ing 	 	 dai 	 ly 	 	contact	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	.
But	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 institution 	 s 	 	that	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 block 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	access	.
And	every	day	,	every	single	day	,	I	read	news	that	 make 	 s 	 	me	 cr 	 ing 	 e 	 	,	like	a	$	15	fine	to	 kid 	 s 	 	in	Texas	,	for	using	,	every	time	they	take	out	 the 	 ir 	 	mobile	phone	in	school	.

 Be 	 hind 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	of	security	and	 safe 	 ty 	 	,	which	have	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	the	 argument 	 s 	 	for	social	control	,	in	fact	what	is	going	on	is	that	these	 institution 	 s 	 	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	decide	who	,	in	fact	,	 ha 	 s 	 	a	right	to	self	determine	 the 	 ir 	 	attention	,	to	decide	,	 whet 	 her 	 	they	should	,	or	not	,	be	 isolate 	 d 	 	.

 Anthon 	 y 	 	 At 	 ala 	 	on	growing	new	 organ 	 s 	 
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 paint 	 ing 	 	that	 hang 	 s 	 	at	the	 Count 	 way 	 	 Libra 	 ry 	 	at	Harvard	 Med 	 ical 	 	School	.
And	it	 show 	 s 	 	the	first	time	an	organ	was	ever	 transplant 	 ed 	 	.
In	the	front	,	you	see	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 Jo 	 e 	 	 Mur 	 ray 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	the	patient	ready	for	the	transplant	,	while	in	the	back	room	you	see	 Hart 	 well 	 	 Har 	 ris 	 on 	 	,	the	Chief	of	 Ur 	 ology 	 	at	Harvard	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	 harvest 	 ing 	 	the	 kid 	 ney 	 	.
The	 kid 	 ney 	 	was	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	the	first	organ	ever	to	be	 transplant 	 ed 	 	to	the	human	.
That	was	back	in	1954	,	55	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
 Y 	 et 	 	we	're	still	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	a	lot	of	the	same	 challeng 	 es 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 decade 	 s 	 	ago	.
 Certain 	 ly 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 advance 	 s 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 live 	 s 	 	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	.
But	we	have	a	major	 short 	 age 	 	of	 organ 	 s 	 	.
In	the	last	decade	the	number	of	 patient 	 s 	 	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	a	transplant	 ha 	 s 	 	 double 	 d 	 	.
 Whi 	 le 	 	,	at	the	same	time	,	the	actual	number	of	 transplant 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 remain 	 ed 	 	 al 	 most 	 	 entire 	 ly 	 	flat	.
That	 re 	 ally 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	do	with	our	aging	population	.
We	're	just	 get 	 ting 	 	 old 	 er 	 	.
Medicine	is	 do 	 ing 	 	a	better	job	of	 keep 	 ing 	 	us	 al 	 ive 	 	.
But	 a 	 s 	 	we	age	,	our	 organ 	 s 	 	tend	to	fail	more	.
So	,	that	's	a	 challeng 	 e 	 	,	not	just	for	 organ 	 s 	 	but	 al 	 so 	 	for	 tissue 	 s 	 	.
 T 	 ry 	 ing 	 	to	replace	 pan 	 cre 	 a 	 s 	 	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	replace	 nerve 	 s 	 	that	can	help	us	with	Parkinson	's	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	major	 issue 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 stunn 	 ing 	 	statistic	.
Every	30	 second 	 s 	 	a	patient	dies	from	 disease 	 s 	 	that	could	be	 treat 	 ed 	 	with	tissue	 re 	 generation 	 	or	 re 	 placement 	 	.
So	,	what	can	we	do	about	it	?
We	've	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	 to 	 night 	 	.
That	's	a	way	to	do	it	.
But	still	ways	to	go	to	get	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 patient 	 s 	 	,	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	actual	 ther 	 a 	 pies 	 	for	 organ 	 s 	 	.
Would	n't	it	be	great	if	our	bodies	could	 re 	 generate 	 	?
Would	n't	it	be	great	if	we	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	harness	the	power	of	our	bodies	,	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	heal	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	?
It	's	not	 re 	 ally 	 	that	foreign	of	a	 con 	 cept 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	;	it	 happen 	 s 	 	on	the	Earth	every	day	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	picture	of	a	salamander	.
 Salam 	 and 	 ers 	 	have	 th 	 is 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	 re 	 generate 	 	.
You	see	here	a	little	video	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	limb	 in 	 jury 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	salamander	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	real	 photograph 	 y 	 	,	 time 	 d 	 	 photograph 	 y 	 	,	 show 	 ing 	 	how	that	limb	 re 	 generate 	 s 	 	in	a	period	of	 day 	 s 	 	.
You	see	the	scar	form	.
And	that	scar	 actual 	 ly 	 	 grow 	 s 	 	out	a	new	limb	.
So	,	 salamander 	 s 	 	can	do	it	.
Why	ca	n't	we	?	Why	ca	n't	 human 	 s 	 	 re 	 generate 	 	?
 Actu 	 ally 	 	,	we	can	 re 	 generate 	 	.
Your	body	 ha 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 organ 	 s 	 	and	every	single	organ	in	your	body	 ha 	 s 	 	a	cell	population	that	's	ready	to	take	over	at	the	time	of	 in 	 jury 	 	.	It	 happen 	 s 	 	every	day	.
 A 	 s 	 	you	age	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	get	 old 	 er 	 	.
Your	 bone 	 s 	 	 re 	 generate 	 	every	10	 year 	 s 	 	.
Your	skin	 re 	 generate 	 s 	 	every	two	 week 	 s 	 	.
So	,	your	body	is	 constant 	 ly 	 	 re 	 generating 	 	.
The	 challeng 	 e 	 	 occur 	 s 	 	when	there	is	an	 in 	 jury 	 	.
At	the	time	of	 in 	 jury 	 	or	disease	,	the	body	's	first	 re 	 action 	 	is	to	seal	 it 	 self 	 	off	from	the	rest	of	the	body	.
It	 bas 	 ically 	 	 want 	 s 	 	to	fight	off	 infect 	 ion 	 	,	and	seal	 it 	 self 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	 organ 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	your	body	,	or	your	skin	,	the	first	 re 	 action 	 	is	for	scar	tissue	to	move	in	,	to	seal	 it 	 self 	 	off	from	the	 out 	 side 	 	.
So	,	how	can	we	harness	that	power	?
One	of	the	ways	that	we	do	that	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	by	using	smart	 bio 	 material 	 s 	 	.
How	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	work	?	Well	,	on	the	left	side	here	you	see	a	 ure 	 thra 	 	which	was	 inju 	 red 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	channel	that	 connect 	 s 	 	the	bladder	to	the	 out 	 side 	 	of	the	body	.
And	you	see	that	it	is	 inju 	 red 	 	.
We	 bas 	 ically 	 	found	out	that	you	can	use	these	smart	 bio 	 material 	 s 	 	that	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	use	 a 	 s 	 	a	bridge	.
If	you	build	that	bridge	,	and	you	close	off	from	the	 out 	 side 	 	environment	,	then	you	can	create	that	bridge	,	and	 cell 	 s 	 	that	 re 	 generate 	 	in	your	body	,	can	then	cross	that	bridge	,	and	take	that	path	.
That	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	you	see	here	.
It	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	smart	 bio 	 material 	 	that	we	used	,	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	treat	 th 	 is 	 	patient	.
 Th 	 is 	 	was	an	 inju 	 red 	 	 ure 	 thra 	 	on	the	left	side	.
We	used	that	 bio 	 material 	 	in	the	middle	.
And	then	,	six	 month 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	on	the	 right 	 - 	 hand 	 	side	you	see	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 engineered 	 	 ure 	 thra 	 	.
 Turn 	 s 	 	out	your	body	can	 re 	 generate 	 	,	but	 on 	 ly 	 	for	small	 distance 	 s 	 	.
The	 maxim 	 um 	 	efficient	distance	for	 re 	 generation 	 	is	 on 	 ly 	 	about	one	centimeter	.
So	,	we	can	use	these	smart	 bio 	 material 	 s 	 	but	 on 	 ly 	 	for	about	one	centimeter	to	bridge	 t 	 hose 	 	 gap 	 s 	 	.
So	,	we	do	 re 	 generate 	 	,	but	for	 limit 	 ed 	 	 distance 	 s 	 	.
What	do	we	do	now	,	if	you	have	 in 	 jury 	 	for	 large 	 r 	 	 organ 	 s 	 	?
What	do	we	do	when	we	have	 inju 	 ries 	 	for	 structure 	 s 	 	which	are	much	 large 	 r 	 	than	one	centimeter	?
 Th 	 en 	 	we	can	start	to	use	 cell 	 s 	 	.
The	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	here	,	is	if	a	patient	 come 	 s 	 	in	to	us	with	a	 disease 	 d 	 	or	 inju 	 red 	 	organ	,	you	can	take	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	piece	of	tissue	from	that	organ	,	less	than	half	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	a	 post 	 age 	 	stamp	,	you	can	then	 teas 	 e 	 	that	tissue	 a 	 part 	 	,	and	look	at	 it 	 s 	 	 bas 	 ic 	 	 component 	 s 	 	,	the	patient	's	own	 cell 	 s 	 	,	you	take	 t 	 hose 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	out	,	grow	and	expand	 t 	 hose 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	 out 	 side 	 	the	body	in	large	 quant 	 ities 	 	,	and	then	we	then	use	scaffold	 material 	 s 	 	.
To	the	naked	eye	they	look	like	a	piece	of	your	 bl 	 ous 	 e 	 	,	or	your	shirt	,	but	 actual 	 ly 	 	these	 material 	 s 	 	are	 fair 	 ly 	 	complex	and	they	are	designed	to	 de 	 grade 	 	once	 in 	 side 	 	the	body	.
It	 dis 	 integrate 	 s 	 	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	.
It	's	 act 	 ing 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	cell	 deliver 	 y 	 	vehicle	.
It	's	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	the	 cell 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	body	.	It	's	 allow 	 ing 	 	the	 cell 	 s 	 	to	 re 	 generate 	 	new	tissue	,	and	once	the	tissue	is	 re 	 generated 	 	the	scaffold	 go 	 es 	 	away	.
And	that	's	what	we	did	for	 th 	 is 	 	piece	of	muscle	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 show 	 ing 	 	a	piece	of	muscle	and	how	we	go	through	the	 structure 	 s 	 	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	engineer	the	muscle	.
We	take	the	 cell 	 s 	 	,	we	expand	them	,	we	place	the	 cell 	 s 	 	on	the	scaffold	,	and	we	then	place	the	scaffold	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	patient	.
But	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	before	placing	the	scaffold	 in 	 to 	 	the	patient	,	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	 exercis 	 e 	 	it	.
We	want	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	we	condition	 th 	 is 	 	muscle	,	so	that	it	 know 	 s 	 	what	to	do	once	we	put	it	 in 	 to 	 	the	patient	.
That	's	what	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	here	.	You	're	 see 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	muscle	 bio 	 - 	 reactor 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 exercis 	 ing 	 	the	muscle	back	and	forth	.
 Oka 	 y 	 	.	 Th 	 ese 	 	are	flat	 structure 	 s 	 	that	we	see	here	,	the	muscle	.
What	about	other	 structure 	 s 	 	?
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	an	engineered	blood	vessel	.
 Ver 	 y 	 	similar	to	what	we	just	did	,	but	a	little	bit	more	complex	.
 He 	 re 	 	we	take	a	scaffold	,	and	we	 bas 	 ically 	 	--	scaffold	can	be	like	a	piece	of	paper	here	.
And	we	can	then	 tub 	 ular 	 ize 	 	 th 	 is 	 	scaffold	.
And	what	we	do	is	we	,	to	make	a	blood	vessel	,	same	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	.
A	blood	vessel	is	made	up	of	two	different	cell	 type 	 s 	 	.
We	take	muscle	 cell 	 s 	 	,	we	paste	,	or	coat	the	 out 	 side 	 	with	these	muscle	 cell 	 s 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	much	like	 ba 	 king 	 	a	layer	cake	,	if	you	will	.
You	place	the	muscle	 cell 	 s 	 	on	the	 out 	 side 	 	.
You	place	the	vascular	blood	vessel	lining	 cell 	 s 	 	on	the	 in 	 side 	 	.
You	now	have	your	fully	 seed 	 ed 	 	scaffold	.
You	're	going	to	place	 th 	 is 	 	in	an	 oven 	 - 	 like 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	.
It	 ha 	 s 	 	the	same	 condition 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	human	body	,	37	 degree 	 s 	 	 cent 	 i 	 grade 	 	,	95	percent	oxygen	.
You	then	 exercis 	 e 	 	it	,	 a 	 s 	 	what	you	saw	on	that	tape	.
And	on	the	right	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	see	a	 car 	 oti 	 d 	 	 art 	 ery 	 	that	was	engineered	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	 art 	 ery 	 	that	 go 	 es 	 	from	your	neck	to	your	brain	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 X 	 - 	 ray 	 	 show 	 ing 	 	you	the	patent	,	functional	blood	vessel	.
 Mo 	 re 	 	complex	 structure 	 s 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	blood	 vessel 	 s 	 	,	 ure 	 thra 	 s 	 	,	which	I	 show 	 ed 	 	you	,	they	're	 definite 	 ly 	 	more	complex	 be 	 cause 	 	you	're	 introduc 	 ing 	 	two	different	cell	 type 	 s 	 	.
But	they	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 act 	 ing 	 	 most 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 conduit 	 s 	 	.
You	're	 allow 	 ing 	 	fluid	or	air	to	go	through	at	 stead 	 y 	 	 state 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	are	not	 near 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	complex	 a 	 s 	 	hollow	 organ 	 s 	 	.
 Hol 	 low 	 	 organ 	 s 	 	have	a	much	 high 	 er 	 	degree	of	 complex 	 ity 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	're	 ask 	 ing 	 	these	 organ 	 s 	 	to	act	on	demand	.
So	,	the	bladder	is	one	 s 	 uch 	 	organ	.
 Sam 	 e 	 	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	,	we	take	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	piece	of	the	bladder	,	less	than	half	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	a	 post 	 age 	 	stamp	.
We	then	 teas 	 e 	 	the	tissue	 a 	 part 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 it 	 s 	 	two	individual	cell	 component 	 s 	 	,	muscle	,	and	these	bladder	 special 	 ized 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	.
We	grow	the	 cell 	 s 	 	 out 	 side 	 	the	body	in	large	 quant 	 ities 	 	.
It	 take 	 s 	 	about	four	 week 	 s 	 	to	grow	these	 cell 	 s 	 	from	the	organ	.
We	then	take	a	scaffold	that	we	shape	like	a	bladder	.
We	coat	the	 in 	 side 	 	with	these	bladder	lining	 cell 	 s 	 	.
We	coat	the	 out 	 side 	 	with	these	muscle	 cell 	 s 	 	.
We	place	it	back	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 oven 	 - 	 like 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	.
From	the	time	you	take	that	piece	of	tissue	,	six	to	eight	 week 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	you	can	put	the	organ	right	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	patient	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 show 	 s 	 	the	scaffold	.
The	material	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 co 	 ated 	 	with	the	 cell 	 s 	 	.
When	we	did	the	first	 clinic 	 al 	 	trial	for	these	 patient 	 s 	 	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	 create 	 d 	 	the	scaffold	 specific 	 ally 	 	for	each	patient	.
We	 br 	 ought 	 	 patient 	 s 	 	in	,	six	to	eight	 week 	 s 	 	prior	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 schedule 	 d 	 	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	,	did	 X 	 - 	 ray 	 s 	 	,	and	we	then	 compose 	 d 	 	a	scaffold	 specific 	 ally 	 	for	that	patient	's	 s 	 ize 	 	For	the	second	phase	of	the	 trial 	 s 	 	we	just	had	different	 s 	 ize 	 s 	 	,	small	,	medium	,	large	and	 extra 	 - 	 large 	 	.
It	's	true	.
And	I	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	 every 	 one 	 	here	 want 	 ed 	 	an	 extra 	 - 	 large 	 	.	Right	?
So	,	 bladder 	 s 	 	are	 definite 	 ly 	 	a	little	bit	more	complex	than	the	other	 structure 	 s 	 	.
But	there	are	other	hollow	 organ 	 s 	 	that	have	 add 	 ed 	 	 complex 	 ity 	 	to	it	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	heart	 val 	 ve 	 	,	which	we	engineered	.
And	the	way	you	engineer	 th 	 is 	 	heart	 val 	 ve 	 	is	the	same	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	.
We	take	the	scaffold	,	we	seed	it	with	 cell 	 s 	 	,	and	you	can	now	see	here	,	the	 val 	 ve 	 	 leaf 	 lets 	 	 open 	 ing 	 	and	 clo 	 s 	 ing 	 	.
We	 exercis 	 e 	 	these	prior	to	 implant 	 ation 	 	.
 Sam 	 e 	 	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	.
And	then	the	most	complex	are	the	solid	 organ 	 s 	 	.
For	solid	 organ 	 s 	 	,	they	're	more	complex	 be 	 cause 	 	you	're	using	a	lot	more	 cell 	 s 	 	per	centimeter	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	simple	solid	organ	like	the	ear	.
It	's	now	 be 	 ing 	 	 seed 	 ed 	 	with	 cart 	 il 	 age 	 	.
That	's	the	 oven 	 - 	 like 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	;	once	it	's	 co 	 ated 	 	it	 get 	 s 	 	 place 	 d 	 	there	.
And	then	a	few	 week 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	we	can	take	out	the	 cart 	 il 	 age 	 	scaffold	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 digit 	 s 	 	that	we	're	 engineer 	 ing 	 	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 layer 	 ed 	 	,	one	layer	at	a	time	,	first	the	bone	,	we	fill	in	the	 gap 	 s 	 	with	 cart 	 il 	 age 	 	.
We	then	start	 add 	 ing 	 	the	muscle	on	top	.
And	you	start	 layer 	 ing 	 	these	solid	 structure 	 s 	 	.
 Aga 	 in 	 	,	 fair 	 ly 	 	more	complex	 organ 	 s 	 	,	but	by	far	,	the	most	complex	solid	 organ 	 s 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	 vascular 	 ized 	 	,	 high 	 ly 	 	 vascular 	 ized 	 	,	a	lot	of	blood	vessel	supply	,	 organ 	 s 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	heart	,	the	liver	,	the	 kid 	 ney 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	--	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 strat 	 egi 	 es 	 	to	engineer	solid	 organ 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	one	of	the	 strat 	 egi 	 es 	 	.	We	use	a	 print 	 er 	 	.
And	 in 	 stead 	 	of	using	ink	,	we	use	--	you	just	saw	an	 ink 	 jet 	 	 cart 	 ridge 	 	--	we	just	use	 cell 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	your	typical	 desk 	 top 	 	 print 	 er 	 	.
It	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 print 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	two	chamber	heart	,	one	layer	at	a	time	.
You	see	the	heart	coming	out	there	.	It	 take 	 s 	 	about	40	 minute 	 s 	 	to	print	,	and	about	four	to	six	 hour 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	you	see	the	muscle	 cell 	 s 	 	contract	.
 Th 	 is 	 	technology	was	 develop 	 ed 	 	by	 Ta 	 o 	 	Ju	,	who	 work 	 ed 	 	at	our	institute	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	still	,	of	course	,	 experiment 	 al 	 	,	not	for	use	in	 patient 	 s 	 	.
 An 	 other 	 	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	that	we	have	 follow 	 ed 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	to	use	 de 	 cellular 	 ized 	 	 organ 	 s 	 	.
We	 actual 	 ly 	 	take	donor	 organ 	 s 	 	,	 organ 	 s 	 	that	are	 dis 	 card 	 ed 	 	,	and	we	then	can	use	 ver 	 y 	 	mild	 detergent 	 s 	 	to	take	all	the	cell	 element 	 s 	 	out	of	these	 organ 	 s 	 	.
So	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	on	the	left	 pan 	 el 	 	,	top	 pan 	 el 	 	,	you	see	a	liver	.
We	 actual 	 ly 	 	take	the	donor	liver	,	we	use	 ver 	 y 	 	mild	 detergent 	 s 	 	,	and	we	,	by	using	these	mild	 detergent 	 s 	 	,	we	take	all	the	 cell 	 s 	 	out	of	the	liver	.
Two	 week 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	we	 bas 	 ically 	 	can	lift	 th 	 is 	 	organ	up	,	it	 feel 	 s 	 	like	a	liver	,	we	can	hold	it	like	a	liver	,	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	liver	,	but	it	 ha 	 s 	 	no	 cell 	 s 	 	.
All	we	are	left	with	is	the	skeleton	,	if	you	will	,	of	the	liver	,	all	made	up	of	 collage 	 n 	 	,	a	material	that	's	in	our	bodies	,	that	will	not	reject	.
We	can	use	it	from	one	patient	to	the	next	.
We	then	take	 th 	 is 	 	vascular	structure	and	we	can	prove	that	we	retain	the	blood	vessel	supply	.
You	can	see	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	that	's	a	 fluo 	 roscopy 	 	.
We	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 inject 	 ing 	 	contrast	 in 	 to 	 	the	organ	.
 N 	 ow 	 	you	can	see	it	start	.	We	're	 inject 	 ing 	 	the	contrast	 in 	 to 	 	the	organ	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 de 	 cellular 	 ized 	 	liver	.
And	you	can	see	the	vascular	tree	that	 remain 	 s 	 	 in 	 tact 	 	.
We	then	take	the	 cell 	 s 	 	,	the	vascular	 cell 	 s 	 	,	blood	vessel	 cell 	 s 	 	,	we	 per 	 fuse 	 	the	vascular	tree	with	the	patient	's	own	 cell 	 s 	 	.
We	 per 	 fuse 	 	the	 out 	 side 	 	of	the	liver	with	the	patient	's	own	liver	 cell 	 s 	 	.
And	we	can	then	create	functional	 liver 	 s 	 	.
And	that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	what	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	still	 experiment 	 al 	 	.	But	we	are	able	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	 re 	 produce 	 	the	 functional 	 ity 	 	of	the	liver	structure	,	 experiment 	 ally 	 	.
For	the	 kid 	 ney 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	I	 talk 	 ed 	 	to	you	about	the	first	 paint 	 ing 	 	that	you	saw	,	the	first	slide	I	 show 	 ed 	 	you	,	90	percent	of	the	 patient 	 s 	 	on	the	transplant	wait	list	are	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	a	 kid 	 ney 	 	,	90	percent	.
So	,	 an 	 other 	 	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	we	're	 follow 	 ing 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	to	create	 wafer 	 s 	 	that	we	stack	together	,	like	an	 accord 	 ion 	 	,	if	you	will	.
So	,	we	stack	these	 wafer 	 s 	 	together	,	using	the	 kid 	 ney 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	.
And	then	you	can	see	these	 miniatur 	 e 	 	 kid 	 ney 	 s 	 	that	we	've	engineered	.
 The 	 y 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	making	 urin 	 e 	 	.
 Aga 	 in 	 	,	small	 structure 	 s 	 	,	our	 challeng 	 e 	 	is	how	to	make	them	 large 	 r 	 	,	and	that	is	 some 	 thing 	 	we	're	 work 	 ing 	 	on	right	now	at	the	institute	.
One	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	I	 want 	 ed 	 	to	summarize	for	you	then	is	what	is	a	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	that	we	're	going	for	in	 re 	 generative 	 	medicine	.
If	at	all	possible	,	we	 re 	 ally 	 	would	like	to	use	smart	 bio 	 material 	 s 	 	that	we	can	just	take	off	the	shelf	and	 re 	 generate 	 	your	 organ 	 s 	 	.
We	are	 limit 	 ed 	 	with	 distance 	 s 	 	right	now	,	but	our	goal	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	to	 in 	 crease 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 distance 	 s 	 	over	time	.
If	we	can	not	use	smart	 bio 	 material 	 s 	 	,	then	we	'd	 ra 	 ther 	 	use	your	 ver 	 y 	 	own	 cell 	 s 	 	.
Why	?	 Be 	 cause 	 	they	will	not	reject	.
We	can	take	 cell 	 s 	 	from	you	,	create	the	structure	,	put	it	right	back	 in 	 to 	 	you	,	they	will	not	reject	.
And	if	possible	,	we	'd	 ra 	 ther 	 	use	the	 cell 	 s 	 	from	your	 ver 	 y 	 	specific	organ	.
If	you	present	with	a	 disease 	 d 	 	wind	pipe	we	'd	like	to	take	 cell 	 s 	 	from	your	 wind 	 pipe 	 	.
If	you	present	with	a	 disease 	 d 	 	 pan 	 cre 	 a 	 s 	 	we	'd	like	to	take	 cell 	 s 	 	from	that	organ	.
Why	?	 Be 	 cause 	 	we	'd	 ra 	 ther 	 	take	 t 	 hose 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	which	 al 	 ready 	 	know	that	 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	cell	 type 	 s 	 	you	want	.
A	 wind 	 pipe 	 	cell	 al 	 ready 	 	 know 	 s 	 	it	's	a	 wind 	 pipe 	 	cell	.
We	do	n't	need	to	teach	it	to	 be 	 come 	 	 an 	 other 	 	cell	type	.
So	,	we	prefer	 organ 	 - 	 specific 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	.
And	 to 	 day 	 	we	can	obtain	 cell 	 s 	 	from	most	every	organ	in	your	body	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	for	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	which	we	still	need	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	for	,	like	heart	,	liver	,	nerve	and	 pan 	 cre 	 a 	 s 	 	.
And	for	 t 	 hose 	 	we	still	need	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	.
If	we	can	not	use	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	from	your	body	then	we	'd	like	to	use	donor	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	.
And	we	prefer	 cell 	 s 	 	that	will	not	reject	and	will	not	form	 tumor 	 s 	 	.
And	we	're	 work 	 ing 	 	a	lot	with	the	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	that	we	 publish 	 ed 	 	on	two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	stem	 cell 	 s 	 	from	the	 am 	 ni 	 otic 	 	fluid	,	and	the	 place 	 nta 	 	,	which	have	 t 	 hose 	 	 proper 	 ties 	 	.
So	,	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	,	I	do	want	to	tell	you	that	some	of	the	major	 challeng 	 es 	 	we	have	.
You	know	,	I	just	 show 	 ed 	 	you	 th 	 is 	 	 present 	 ation 	 	,	 every 	 thing 	 	 look 	 s 	 	so	good	,	 every 	 thing 	 	 work 	 s 	 	.	 Actu 	 ally 	 	no	,	these	 techno 	 logies 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	are	not	that	easy	.
Some	of	the	work	you	saw	 to 	 day 	 	was	 perform 	 ed 	 	by	over	700	 research 	 ers 	 	at	our	institute	 a 	 cross 	 	a	20-year	time	span	.
So	,	these	are	 ver 	 y 	 	tough	 techno 	 logies 	 	.
 O 	 nce 	 	you	get	the	formula	right	you	can	replicate	it	.
But	it	 take 	 s 	 	a	lot	to	get	there	.
So	,	I	 al 	 ways 	 	like	to	show	 th 	 is 	 	cartoon	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	how	to	stop	a	 run 	 away 	 	stage	.
And	there	you	see	the	 stage 	 coach 	 	driver	,	and	he	 go 	 es 	 	,	on	the	top	 pan 	 el 	 	,	He	 go 	 es 	 	A	,	B	,	C	,	D	,	E	,	F	.
He	 final 	 ly 	 	 stop 	 s 	 	the	 run 	 away 	 	stage	.
And	 t 	 hose 	 	are	 usual 	 ly 	 	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	The	bottom	is	 usual 	 ly 	 	the	 surgeon 	 s 	 	.
I	'm	a	surgeon	so	that	's	not	that	funny	.
But	 actual 	 ly 	 	method	A	is	the	correct	approach	.
And	what	I	mean	by	that	is	that	 any 	 time 	 	we	've	 launch 	 ed 	 	one	of	these	 techno 	 logies 	 	to	the	clinic	,	we	've	made	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	that	we	do	 every 	 thing 	 	we	can	in	the	 labor 	 atory 	 	before	we	ever	launch	these	 techno 	 logies 	 	to	 patient 	 s 	 	.
And	when	we	launch	these	 techno 	 logies 	 	to	 patient 	 s 	 	we	want	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	we	ask	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	tough	question	.
 A 	 re 	 	you	ready	to	place	 th 	 is 	 	in	your	own	 love 	 d 	 	one	,	your	own	child	,	your	own	family	member	,	and	then	we	proceed	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	our	main	goal	,	of	course	,	is	first	,	to	do	no	harm	.
I	'm	going	to	show	you	now	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	short	clip	,	It	's	a	five	second	clip	of	a	patient	who	 receiv 	 ed 	 	one	of	the	engineered	 organ 	 s 	 	.
We	 start 	 ed 	 	 implant 	 ing 	 	some	of	these	 structure 	 s 	 	over	14	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
So	,	we	have	 patient 	 s 	 	now	 walk 	 ing 	 	around	with	 organ 	 s 	 	,	engineered	 organ 	 s 	 	,	for	over	10	 year 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
I	'm	going	to	show	a	clip	of	one	young	 lad 	 y 	 	.
She	had	a	 spin 	 a 	 	bifida	defect	,	a	 spin 	 al 	 	cord	 ab 	 normal 	 ity 	 	.
She	did	not	have	a	normal	bladder	.	 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	segment	from	CNN	.
We	are	just	taking	five	 second 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	segment	that	 San 	 ja 	 y 	 	Gupta	 actual 	 ly 	 	took	care	of	.
 V 	 ideo 	 	:	 Ka 	 it 	 lyn 	 	M	:	I	'm	happy	.	I	was	 al 	 ways 	 	 af 	 raid 	 	that	I	was	going	to	have	like	,	an	accident	or	 some 	 thing 	 	.
And	now	I	can	just	go	and	go	out	with	my	 friend 	 s 	 	,	go	do	 what 	 ever 	 	I	want	.
 Anthon 	 y 	 	 At 	 ala 	 	:	See	,	at	the	end	of	the	day	,	the	promise	of	 re 	 generative 	 	medicine	is	a	single	promise	.
And	that	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	,	to	make	our	 patient 	 s 	 	better	.
Thank	you	for	your	attention	.

 Cam 	 er 	 on 	 	 Her 	 old 	 	:	Let	's	raise	 kid 	 s 	 	to	be	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 
I	would	be	 will 	 ing 	 	to	bet	that	I	'm	the	 dumb 	 est 	 	guy	in	the	room	 be 	 cause 	 	I	could	n't	get	through	school	.	I	 struggle 	 d 	 	with	school	.
It	's	not	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	a	bad	thing	and	is	 vil 	 ified 	 	,	which	is	what	 happen 	 s 	 	in	a	lot	of	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
 Kid 	 s 	 	,	when	we	grow	up	,	have	 dream 	 s 	 	,	and	we	have	 pass 	 ions 	 	,	and	we	have	 vision 	 s 	 	,	and	 some 	 how 	 	we	get	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 crush 	 ed 	 	.
We	get	told	that	we	need	to	 stud 	 y 	 	 hard 	 er 	 	or	be	more	focused	or	get	a	tutor	.
My	 parent 	 s 	 	got	me	a	tutor	in	French	,	and	I	still	suck	in	French	.
Two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	I	was	the	 highest 	 - 	 rated 	 	 lectur 	 er 	 	at	 MI 	 T 	 	's	 entrepreneur 	 ial 	 	master	's	program	.
And	it	was	a	 s 	 peaking 	 	event	in	front	of	 group 	 s 	 	of	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	from	around	the	world	.
When	I	was	in	grade	two	,	I	won	a	 city 	 - 	 wide 	 	 s 	 peaking 	 	 com 	 petition 	 	,	but	 no 	 body 	 	had	ever	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Hey	,	 th 	 is 	 	kid	's	a	good	speaker	.
He	ca	n't	focus	,	but	he	 love 	 s 	 	 walk 	 ing 	 	around	and	 get 	 ting 	 	people	 energ 	 ized 	 	.	''
No	one	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Get	him	a	coach	in	 s 	 peaking 	 	.	''
 The 	 y 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	get	me	a	tutor	in	what	I	suck	at	.
So	 a 	 s 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	show	these	 trait 	 s 	 	--	and	we	need	to	start	looking	for	them	--	I	think	we	should	be	raising	 kid 	 s 	 	to	be	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 lawyer 	 s 	 	.
 Un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	the	school	system	is	 groom 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	world	to	say	,	``	Hey	,	let	's	be	a	lawyer	or	let	's	be	a	doctor	,	''	and	we	're	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	that	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	no	one	ever	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	Hey	,	be	an	entrepreneur	.	''
Entrepreneurs	are	people	--	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	a	lot	of	them	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	--	who	have	these	 idea 	 s 	 	and	these	 pass 	 ions 	 	or	see	these	 need 	 s 	 	in	the	world	and	we	decide	to	stand	up	and	do	it	.
And	we	put	 every 	 thing 	 	on	the	line	to	make	that	stuff	happen	.
We	have	the	ability	to	get	 t 	 hose 	 	 group 	 s 	 	of	people	around	us	that	want	to	kind	of	build	that	dream	with	us	,	and	I	think	if	we	could	get	 kid 	 s 	 	to	embrace	the	idea	at	a	young	age	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 entrepreneur 	 ial 	 	,	we	could	change	 every 	 thing 	 	in	the	world	that	is	a	problem	 to 	 day 	 	.
Every	problem	that	's	out	there	,	 some 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	the	idea	for	.
And	 a 	 s 	 	a	young	kid	,	 no 	 body 	 	can	say	it	ca	n't	happen	 be 	 cause 	 	you	're	too	dumb	to	 real 	 ize 	 	that	you	could	n't	figure	it	out	.
I	think	we	have	an	 oblig 	 ation 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	and	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	to	start	 teach 	 ing 	 	our	 kid 	 s 	 	to	fish	 in 	 stead 	 	of	giving	them	the	fish	--	the	old	 par 	 able 	 	:	``	If	you	give	a	man	a	fish	,	you	feed	him	for	a	day	.
If	you	teach	a	man	to	fish	,	you	feed	him	for	a	 life 	 time 	 	.	''
If	we	can	teach	our	 kid 	 s 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	 entrepreneur 	 ial 	 	--	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	show	 t 	 hose 	 	 trait 	 s 	 	to	be	--	like	we	teach	the	 one 	 s 	 	who	have	science	 gift 	 s 	 	to	go	on	in	science	,	what	if	we	saw	the	 one 	 s 	 	who	had	 entrepreneur 	 ial 	 	 trait 	 s 	 	and	taught	them	to	be	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	?
We	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	all	these	 kid 	 s 	 	 spread 	 ing 	 	 business 	 es 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	government	 hand 	 out 	 s 	 	.
What	we	do	is	we	 s 	 it 	 	and	teach	our	 kid 	 s 	 	all	the	 thing 	 s 	 	they	should	n't	do	:	Do	n't	hit	;	do	n't	bite	;	do	n't	 s 	 wear 	 	.
Right	now	we	teach	our	 kid 	 s 	 	to	go	after	 re 	 ally 	 	good	 job 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	and	the	school	system	 teach 	 es 	 	them	to	go	after	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 be 	 ing 	 	a	doctor	and	 be 	 ing 	 	a	lawyer	and	 be 	 ing 	 	an	 account 	 ant 	 	and	a	 dent 	 ist 	 	and	a	teacher	and	a	pilot	.
And	the	media	 say 	 s 	 	that	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	if	we	could	go	out	and	be	a	model	or	a	 s 	 ing 	 er 	 	or	a	 s 	 port 	 s 	 	hero	like	 Lu 	 on 	 go 	 	,	 Cro 	 s 	 by 	 	.
Our	 MB 	 A 	 	 program 	 s 	 	do	not	teach	 kid 	 s 	 	to	be	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	.
The	reason	that	I	 avoid 	 ed 	 	an	 MB 	 A 	 	program	--	other	than	the	fact	that	I	could	n't	get	 in 	 to 	 	any	 be 	 cause 	 	I	had	a	61	percent	average	out	of	high	school	and	then	61	percent	average	at	the	 on 	 ly 	 	school	in	Canada	that	 accept 	 ed 	 	me	,	 Carl 	 ton 	 	--	but	our	 MB 	 A 	 	 program 	 s 	 	do	n't	teach	 kid 	 s 	 	to	be	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	teach	them	to	go	work	in	 corporation 	 s 	 	.
So	who	's	 start 	 ing 	 	these	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	?	It	's	these	random	few	people	.
Even	in	popular	 liter 	 ature 	 	,	the	 on 	 ly 	 	book	I	've	ever	found	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	should	be	on	all	of	your	 read 	 ing 	 	 list 	 s 	 	--	the	 on 	 ly 	 	book	I	've	ever	found	that	 make 	 s 	 	the	entrepreneur	 in 	 to 	 	the	hero	is	``	Atlas	 Shrugg 	 ed 	 	.	''
 Every 	 thing 	 	else	in	the	world	 tend 	 s 	 	to	look	at	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	and	say	that	we	're	bad	people	.
I	look	at	even	my	family	.
 Bo 	 th 	 	my	 grand 	 father 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	.	My	dad	was	an	entrepreneur	.
 Bo 	 th 	 	my	brother	and	sister	and	I	,	all	three	of	us	own	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
And	we	all	 decide 	 d 	 	to	start	these	 thing 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	the	 on 	 ly 	 	place	we	fit	.
We	did	n't	fit	in	the	normal	work	.	We	could	n't	work	for	 some 	 body 	 	else	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	too	 s 	 tub 	 born 	 	and	we	have	all	these	other	 trait 	 s 	 	.
But	 kid 	 s 	 	could	be	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
I	'm	a	big	part	of	a	couple	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	 global 	 ly 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	Entrepreneurs	'	 Organ 	 ization 	 	and	the	Young	 Pre 	 sidents 	 	'	 Organ 	 ization 	 	.
I	just	came	back	from	 s 	 peaking 	 	in	 Bar 	 celona 	 	at	the	YPO	global	 con 	 ference 	 	,	and	 every 	 one 	 	that	I	met	over	there	who	's	an	entrepreneur	 struggle 	 d 	 	with	school	.
I	have	18	out	of	the	19	 sign 	 s 	 	of	attention	 defici 	 t 	 	 dis 	 order 	 	 diagnos 	 ed 	 	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	thing	right	here	is	 freak 	 ing 	 	me	out	.
It	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	why	I	'm	a	little	bit	 panic 	 ked 	 	right	now	--	other	than	all	the	 c 	 affe 	 ine 	 	that	I	've	had	and	the	sugar	--	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 creep 	 y 	 	for	an	entrepreneur	.
 Atten 	 tion 	 	 defici 	 t 	 	 dis 	 order 	 	,	 bi 	 polar 	 	 dis 	 order 	 	.
Do	you	know	that	 bi 	 polar 	 	 dis 	 order 	 	is	 nick 	 named 	 	the	CEO	disease	?
 T 	 ed 	 	 Turn 	 er 	 	's	got	it	.	 St 	 eve 	 	 Job 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	it	.
All	three	of	the	 founder 	 s 	 	of	 Net 	 s 	 cape 	 	had	it	.
I	could	go	on	and	on	.
 Kid 	 s 	 	--	you	can	see	these	 sign 	 s 	 	in	 kid 	 s 	 	.
And	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	is	we	're	giving	them	 Rit 	 al 	 in 	 	and	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	Do	n't	be	an	 entrepreneur 	 ial 	 	type	.
Fit	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	other	system	and	try	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	student	.	''
 So 	 rry 	 	,	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	are	n't	 student 	 s 	 	.
We	 fast 	 - 	 track 	 	.	We	figure	out	the	game	.
I	stole	 essay 	 s 	 	.	I	 cheat 	 ed 	 	on	 ex 	 am 	 s 	 	.
I	 hire 	 d 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	to	do	my	 account 	 ing 	 	 assign 	 ments 	 	in	university	for	13	 con 	 s 	 ecutive 	 	 assign 	 ments 	 	.
But	 a 	 s 	 	an	entrepreneur	you	do	n't	do	 account 	 ing 	 	,	you	hire	 account 	 ants 	 	.
So	I	just	 figur 	 ed 	 	that	out	 ear 	 lier 	 	.
At	 l 	 east 	 	I	can	admit	I	 cheat 	 ed 	 	in	university	;	most	of	you	wo	n't	.
I	'm	 al 	 so 	 	 quote 	 d 	 	--	and	I	told	the	person	who	wrote	the	 text 	 book 	 	--	I	'm	now	 quote 	 d 	 	in	that	exact	same	university	 text 	 book 	 	in	every	Canadian	university	and	college	 stud 	 ies 	 	.
In	 manage 	 rial 	 	 account 	 ing 	 	,	I	'm	chapter	eight	.
I	open	up	chapter	eight	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 budget 	 ing 	 	.
And	I	told	the	author	,	after	they	did	my	interview	,	that	I	 cheat 	 ed 	 	in	that	same	course	.
And	she	thought	it	was	too	funny	to	not	include	it	 any 	 way 	 	.
But	 kid 	 s 	 	,	you	can	see	these	 sign 	 s 	 	in	them	.
The	definition	of	an	entrepreneur	is	``	a	person	who	 organize 	 s 	 	,	 oper 	 ates 	 	and	 assum 	 es 	 	the	risk	of	a	business	venture	.	''
That	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	you	have	to	go	to	an	 MB 	 A 	 	program	.
It	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	you	have	to	get	through	school	.
It	just	 mean 	 s 	 	that	 t 	 hose 	 	few	 thing 	 s 	 	have	to	feel	right	in	your	gut	.
And	we	've	heard	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	about	``	is	it	nurture	or	is	it	nature	,	''	right	?
 I 	 s 	 	it	thing	one	or	thing	two	?	What	is	it	?
Well	,	I	do	n't	think	it	's	either	.	I	think	it	can	be	both	.
I	was	 groom 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	entrepreneur	.
When	I	was	growing	up	 a 	 s 	 	a	young	kid	,	I	had	no	choice	,	 be 	 cause 	 	I	was	taught	at	a	 ver 	 y 	 	early	,	young	age	--	when	my	dad	 real 	 ized 	 	I	was	n't	going	to	fit	 in 	 to 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	else	that	was	 be 	 ing 	 	taught	to	me	in	school	--	that	he	could	teach	me	to	figure	out	business	at	an	early	age	.
He	 groom 	 ed 	 	us	,	the	three	of	us	,	to	hate	the	thought	of	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	job	and	to	love	the	fact	of	creating	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	that	we	could	employ	other	people	.
My	first	little	business	venture	:	I	was	seven	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	I	was	in	 Win 	 ni 	 peg 	 	,	and	I	was	 ly 	 ing 	 	in	my	 bed 	 room 	 	with	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	long	 extens 	 ion 	 	 cord 	 s 	 	.
And	I	was	 call 	 ing 	 	all	the	dry	 clean 	 ers 	 	in	 Win 	 ni 	 peg 	 	to	find	out	how	much	would	the	dry	 clean 	 ers 	 	pay	me	for	coat	 hang 	 ers 	 	.
And	my	mom	came	 in 	 to 	 	the	room	and	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Where	are	you	going	to	get	the	coat	 hang 	 ers 	 	to	sell	to	the	dry	 clean 	 ers 	 	?	''
And	I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Let	's	go	and	look	in	the	 base 	 ment 	 	.	''
And	we	went	down	to	the	 base 	 ment 	 	.	And	I	 open 	 ed 	 	up	 th 	 is 	 	 cup 	 board 	 	.
And	there	was	about	a	thousand	coat	 hang 	 ers 	 	that	I	'd	 collect 	 ed 	 	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	,	when	I	told	her	I	was	going	out	to	play	with	the	 kid 	 s 	 	,	I	was	going	door	to	door	in	the	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	to	collect	coat	 hang 	 ers 	 	to	put	in	the	 base 	 ment 	 	to	sell	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	I	saw	her	a	few	 week 	 s 	 	before	that	--	you	could	get	paid	.	 The 	 y 	 	used	to	pay	you	two	 cent 	 s 	 	per	coat	 hang 	 er 	 	.
So	I	was	just	like	,	well	there	's	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	coat	 hang 	 ers 	 	.
And	so	I	'll	just	go	get	them	.
And	I	 k 	 new 	 	she	would	n't	want	me	to	go	get	them	,	so	I	just	did	it	 any 	 way 	 	.
And	I	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	you	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	 negoti 	 ate 	 	with	people	.
 Th 	 is 	 	one	person	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	me	three	 cent 	 s 	 	and	I	got	him	up	to	three	and	a	half	.
I	even	 k 	 new 	 	at	a	 seven 	 - 	 year 	 - 	 old 	 	age	that	I	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	get	a	 fraction 	 al 	 	percent	of	a	cent	,	and	people	would	pay	that	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 multi 	 plied 	 	up	.
At	seven	 year 	 s 	 	old	I	 figur 	 ed 	 	it	out	.	I	got	three	and	a	half	 cent 	 s 	 	for	a	thousand	coat	 hang 	 ers 	 	.
I	 s 	 old 	 	 licens 	 e 	 	plate	 protect 	 ors 	 	door	to	door	.
My	dad	 actual 	 ly 	 	made	me	go	find	 some 	 one 	 	who	would	sell	me	these	 thing 	 s 	 	at	 whole 	 sale 	 	.
And	at	nine	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	I	 walk 	 ed 	 	around	in	the	city	of	 Sud 	 bury 	 	selling	 licens 	 e 	 	plate	 protect 	 ors 	 	door	to	door	to	 house 	 s 	 	.
And	I	remember	 th 	 is 	 	one	 custom 	 er 	 	so	 vivi 	 d 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	I	 al 	 so 	 	did	some	other	stuff	with	these	 client 	 s 	 	.
I	 s 	 old 	 	 news 	 paper 	 s 	 	.
And	he	would	n't	buy	a	 news 	 paper 	 	from	me	ever	.
But	I	was	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	I	was	going	to	get	him	to	buy	a	 licens 	 e 	 	plate	 protect 	 or 	 	.
And	he	's	like	,	``	Well	,	we	do	n't	need	one	.	''
And	I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	But	you	've	got	two	 car 	 s 	 	...	''	--	I	'm	nine	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
I	'm	like	,	``	But	you	have	two	 car 	 s 	 	and	they	do	n't	have	 licens 	 e 	 	plate	 protect 	 ors 	 	.	''
And	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	I	know	.	''
And	I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 Th 	 is 	 	car	here	's	got	one	 licens 	 e 	 	plate	that	's	all	 crumple 	 d 	 	up	.	''
And	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Yes	,	that	's	my	wife	's	car	.	''	And	I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Why	do	n't	we	just	test	one	on	the	front	of	your	wife	's	car	and	see	if	it	 last 	 s 	 	 long 	 er 	 	.	''
So	I	 k 	 new 	 	there	 we 	 re 	 	two	 car 	 s 	 	with	two	 licens 	 e 	 	 plate 	 s 	 	on	each	.
If	I	could	n't	sell	all	four	,	I	could	at	 l 	 east 	 	get	one	.
I	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	at	a	young	age	.
I	did	 com 	 ic 	 	book	 arbitr 	 age 	 	.
When	I	was	about	10	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	I	 s 	 old 	 	 com 	 ic 	 	 book 	 s 	 	out	of	our	cottage	on	 Georgia 	 n 	 	Bay	.
And	I	would	go	 bi 	 king 	 	up	to	the	end	of	the	beach	and	buy	all	the	 com 	 ic 	 s 	 	from	the	poor	 kid 	 s 	 	.
And	then	I	would	go	back	to	the	other	end	of	the	beach	and	sell	them	to	the	rich	 kid 	 s 	 	.
But	it	was	obvious	to	me	,	right	?	Buy	low	,	sell	high	.
You	've	got	 th 	 is 	 	demand	over	here	that	 ha 	 s 	 	money	.
Do	n't	try	to	sell	to	the	poor	 kid 	 s 	 	;	they	do	n't	have	cash	.	The	rich	people	do	.	Go	get	some	.
So	that	's	obvious	,	right	.
It	's	like	a	 recess 	 ion 	 	.	So	,	there	's	a	 recess 	 ion 	 	.
There	's	still	13	trillion	 dollar 	 s 	 	 circul 	 ating 	 	in	the	U.S.	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
Go	get	some	of	that	.	And	I	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	at	a	young	age	.
I	 al 	 so 	 	 learn 	 ed 	 	,	do	n't	reveal	your	source	,	 be 	 cause 	 	I	got	beat	up	after	about	four	 week 	 s 	 	of	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	one	of	the	rich	 kid 	 s 	 	found	out	where	I	was	 buy 	 ing 	 	my	 com 	 ic 	 s 	 	from	,	and	he	did	n't	like	the	fact	that	he	was	 pay 	 ing 	 	a	lot	more	.
I	was	 force 	 d 	 	to	get	a	paper	route	at	10	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
I	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	want	a	paper	route	,	but	at	10	,	my	dad	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	That	's	going	to	be	your	next	business	.	''
So	not	 on 	 ly 	 	would	he	get	me	one	,	but	I	had	to	get	two	,	and	then	he	 want 	 ed 	 	me	to	hire	 some 	 one 	 	to	deliver	half	the	 paper 	 s 	 	,	which	I	did	,	and	then	I	 real 	 ized 	 	that	 collect 	 ing 	 	 tip 	 s 	 	was	where	you	made	all	the	money	.
So	I	would	collect	the	 tip 	 s 	 	and	get	payment	.
So	I	would	go	and	collect	for	all	the	 paper 	 s 	 	.
He	could	just	deliver	them	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	then	I	 real 	 ized 	 	I	could	make	the	money	.
By	 th 	 is 	 	point	,	I	was	 definite 	 ly 	 	not	going	to	be	an	 employ 	 ee 	 	.
My	dad	owned	an	 auto 	 motive 	 	and	industrial	repair	shop	.
He	had	all	these	old	 auto 	 motive 	 	 part 	 s 	 	 ly 	 ing 	 	around	.
 The 	 y 	 	had	 th 	 is 	 	old	 bra 	 s 	 s 	 	and	 cop 	 per 	 	.
I	 ask 	 ed 	 	him	what	he	did	with	it	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	he	just	 throw 	 s 	 	it	out	.
I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	But	would	n't	 some 	 body 	 	pay	you	for	that	?	''	And	he	 go 	 es 	 	,	``	 May 	 be 	 	.	''
 Re 	 member 	 	at	10	 year 	 s 	 	old	--	so	34	 year 	 s 	 	ago	I	saw	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	.
I	saw	there	was	money	in	garbage	.
And	I	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 collect 	 ing 	 	it	from	all	the	 auto 	 motive 	 	 shop 	 s 	 	in	the	area	on	my	 bi 	 cycle 	 	.
And	then	my	dad	would	drive	me	on	 Saturday 	 s 	 	to	a	scrap	metal	 recycl 	 er 	 	where	I	got	paid	.
And	I	thought	that	was	kind	of	cool	.
 Strange 	 ly 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	30	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	we	're	building	1-800-GOT-JUNK	?
and	making	money	off	that	too	.
I	built	these	little	 pin 	 cushion 	 s 	 	when	I	was	11	 year 	 s 	 	old	in	 Cub 	 s 	 	,	and	we	made	these	pin	 cushion 	 s 	 	for	our	 mom 	 s 	 	for	Mother	's	Day	.
And	you	made	these	 pin 	 cushion 	 s 	 	out	of	 wood 	 en 	 	 clothe 	 spin 	 s 	 	--	when	we	used	to	hang	 clothe 	 s 	 	on	 clothe 	 s 	 lines 	 	 out 	 side 	 	.
And	you	'd	make	these	 chair 	 s 	 	.
And	I	had	these	little	 pil 	 low 	 s 	 	that	I	would	sew	up	.
And	you	could	stuff	 pin 	 s 	 	in	them	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	people	used	to	sew	and	they	 need 	 ed 	 	a	pin	cushion	.
But	what	I	 real 	 ized 	 	was	that	you	had	to	have	 option 	 s 	 	.
So	I	 actual 	 ly 	 	spray	 paint 	 ed 	 	a	whole	bunch	of	them	 brow 	 n 	 	.
And	then	when	I	went	to	the	door	,	it	was	n't	,	``	Do	you	want	to	buy	one	?	''
It	was	,	``	 Whi 	 ch 	 	color	would	you	like	?	''
Like	I	'm	10	 year 	 s 	 	old	;	you	're	not	going	to	say	no	to	me	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	if	you	have	two	 option 	 s 	 	--	you	have	the	 brow 	 n 	 	one	or	the	clear	one	.
So	I	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	 less 	 on 	 	at	a	young	age	.
I	 learn 	 ed 	 	that	manual	labor	 re 	 ally 	 	 suck 	 s 	 	.
Right	,	like	cutting	 lawn 	 s 	 	is	brutal	.
But	 be 	 cause 	 	I	had	to	cut	 lawn 	 s 	 	all	summer	for	all	of	our	 neighbor 	 s 	 	and	get	paid	to	do	that	,	I	 real 	 ized 	 	that	 recur 	 ring 	 	revenue	from	one	client	is	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
That	if	I	land	 th 	 is 	 	client	once	,	and	every	week	I	get	paid	by	that	person	,	that	's	way	better	than	 try 	 ing 	 	to	sell	one	 clothe 	 spin 	 	thing	to	one	person	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	you	ca	n't	sell	them	more	.
So	I	love	that	 recur 	 ring 	 	revenue	model	I	 start 	 ed 	 	to	learn	at	a	young	age	.
 Re 	 member 	 	,	I	was	 be 	 ing 	 	 groom 	 ed 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.	I	was	not	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	have	 job 	 s 	 	.
I	would	 c 	 addy 	 	,	I	would	go	to	the	golf	course	and	 c 	 addy 	 	for	people	.
But	I	 real 	 ized 	 	that	there	was	 th 	 is 	 	one	hill	on	our	golf	course	,	the	13th	hole	that	had	 th 	 is 	 	huge	hill	.
And	people	could	never	get	 the 	 ir 	 	 bag 	 s 	 	up	it	.
So	I	would	 s 	 it 	 	there	with	a	lawn	chair	and	just	carry	up	all	the	people	who	did	n't	have	 cad 	 dies 	 	.
I	would	carry	 the 	 ir 	 	golf	 bag 	 s 	 	up	to	the	top	,	and	they	'd	pay	me	a	dollar	.
 Mean 	 while 	 	,	my	 friend 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	for	five	 hour 	 s 	 	to	haul	some	guy	's	bag	around	and	get	paid	10	 buck 	 s 	 	.
I	'm	like	,	``	That	's	stupid	 be 	 cause 	 	you	have	to	work	for	five	 hour 	 s 	 	.
That	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	any	sense	.	''	You	just	figure	out	a	way	to	make	more	money	 fast 	 er 	 	.
Every	week	,	I	would	go	to	the	corner	store	and	buy	all	these	 pop 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 en 	 	I	would	go	up	and	deliver	them	to	these	70-year-old	women	 play 	 ing 	 	bridge	.
And	they	'd	give	me	 the 	 ir 	 	 order 	 s 	 	for	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	week	.
And	then	I	'd	just	deliver	pop	and	I	'd	just	charge	twice	.
And	I	had	 th 	 is 	 	 capture 	 d 	 	market	.	You	did	n't	need	 contract 	 s 	 	.
You	just	 need 	 ed 	 	to	have	a	supply	and	demand	and	 th 	 is 	 	audience	who	 b 	 ought 	 	 in 	 to 	 	you	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	women	 we 	 re 	 	n't	going	to	go	to	 any 	 body 	 	else	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 like 	 d 	 	me	,	and	I	kind	of	 figur 	 ed 	 	it	out	.
I	went	and	got	golf	 ball 	 s 	 	from	golf	 course 	 s 	 	.
But	 every 	 body 	 	else	was	looking	in	the	bush	and	looking	in	the	 d 	 itch 	 es 	 	for	golf	 ball 	 s 	 	.
I	'm	like	,	screw	that	.	 The 	 y 	 	're	all	in	the	pond	and	 no 	 body 	 	's	going	 in 	 to 	 	the	pond	.
So	I	would	go	 in 	 to 	 	the	 pond 	 s 	 	and	crawl	around	and	pick	them	up	with	my	 to 	 es 	 	.
You	just	pick	them	up	with	both	feet	.
You	ca	n't	do	it	on	stage	.
You	get	the	golf	 ball 	 s 	 	,	and	you	just	throw	them	in	your	 bath 	 ing 	 	suit	 trunk 	 s 	 	and	when	you	're	 d 	 one 	 	you	've	got	a	couple	hundred	of	them	.
But	the	problem	is	that	people	all	did	n't	want	all	the	golf	 ball 	 s 	 	.
So	I	just	 package 	 d 	 	them	.	I	'm	like	12	,	right	?
I	 package 	 d 	 	them	up	three	ways	.
I	had	the	 Pin 	 n 	 acle 	 s 	 	and	 DD 	 H 	 s 	 	and	the	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	 one 	 s 	 	back	then	.
 T 	 hose 	 	 s 	 old 	 	for	two	 dollar 	 s 	 	each	.
And	then	I	had	all	the	good	 one 	 s 	 	that	did	n't	look	 crap 	 py 	 	.	 The 	 y 	 	 we 	 re 	 	50	 cent 	 s 	 	each	.
And	then	I	'd	sell	50	at	a	time	of	all	the	 crap 	 py 	 	 one 	 s 	 	.
And	they	could	use	 t 	 hose 	 	for	practice	 ball 	 s 	 	.
I	 s 	 old 	 	 s 	 un 	 glass 	 es 	 	,	when	I	was	in	school	,	to	all	the	 kid 	 s 	 	in	high	school	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	what	 re 	 ally 	 	kind	of	 get 	 s 	 	 every 	 body 	 	 hat 	 ing 	 	you	is	 be 	 cause 	 	you	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 ex 	 tract 	 	money	from	all	your	 friend 	 s 	 	all	the	time	.
But	it	paid	the	 bill 	 s 	 	.
So	I	 s 	 old 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 s 	 un 	 glass 	 es 	 	.
 Th 	 en 	 	when	the	school	shut	me	down	--	the	school	 actual 	 ly 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	me	 in 	 to 	 	the	 off 	 ice 	 	and	told	me	I	could	n't	do	it	--	so	I	went	to	the	gas	 station 	 s 	 	and	I	 s 	 old 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	them	to	the	gas	 station 	 s 	 	and	had	the	gas	 station 	 s 	 	sell	them	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 custom 	 ers 	 	.
That	was	cool	 be 	 cause 	 	then	I	had	 re 	 tail 	 	 out 	 lets 	 	.
And	I	think	I	was	14	.
 Th 	 en 	 	I	paid	my	entire	way	through	first	year	university	at	 Carl 	 ton 	 	by	selling	wine	 skin 	 s 	 	door	to	door	.
You	know	that	you	can	hold	a	40-ounce	bottle	of	rum	and	two	 bottle 	 s 	 	of	 co 	 ke 	 	in	a	 wine 	 skin 	 	?	So	what	,	right	?
Yeah	,	but	you	know	what	?	You	stuff	that	down	your	 short 	 s 	 	,	when	you	go	 in 	 to 	 	a	 foot 	 ball 	 	game	you	can	get	 boo 	 ze 	 	in	for	free	,	 every 	 body 	 	 b 	 ought 	 	them	.
 Sup 	 ply 	 	,	demand	,	big	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	.
I	 al 	 so 	 	 brand 	 ed 	 	it	,	so	I	 s 	 old 	 	them	for	five	 time 	 s 	 	the	normal	cost	.
It	had	our	university	logo	on	it	.
You	know	we	teach	our	 kid 	 s 	 	and	we	buy	them	 game 	 s 	 	,	but	why	do	n't	we	get	them	 game 	 s 	 	,	if	they	're	 entrepreneur 	 ial 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	,	that	kind	of	nurture	the	 trait 	 s 	 	that	you	need	to	be	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	?
Why	do	n't	you	teach	them	not	to	waste	money	?
I	remember	 be 	 ing 	 	told	to	walk	out	in	the	middle	of	a	street	in	 Ban 	 ff 	 	,	 Al 	 bert 	 a 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	I	'd	 throw 	 n 	 	a	 pen 	 ny 	 	out	in	the	street	,	and	my	dad	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Go	pick	it	up	.	''
He	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	I	work	too	damn	hard	for	my	money	.	I	'm	not	going	to	see	you	ever	waste	a	 pen 	 ny 	 	.	''
And	I	remember	that	 less 	 on 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	day	.
 Al 	 low 	 ance 	 s 	 	teach	 kid 	 s 	 	the	wrong	 habit 	 s 	 	.
 Al 	 low 	 ance 	 s 	 	,	by	nature	,	are	 teach 	 ing 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	to	think	about	a	job	.
An	entrepreneur	 do 	 es 	 	n't	expect	a	regular	 pay 	 check 	 	.
 Al 	 low 	 ance 	 	is	 breed 	 ing 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	at	a	young	age	to	expect	a	regular	 pay 	 check 	 	.
That	's	wrong	,	for	me	,	if	you	want	to	raise	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	.
What	I	do	with	my	 kid 	 s 	 	now	--	I	've	got	two	,	nine	and	seven	--	is	I	teach	them	to	walk	around	the	house	and	the	yard	,	looking	for	stuff	that	 need 	 s 	 	to	get	 d 	 one 	 	.
Come	to	me	and	tell	me	what	it	is	.
Or	I	'll	come	to	them	and	say	,	``	 He 	 re 	 	's	what	I	need	 d 	 one 	 	.	''
And	then	you	know	what	we	do	?	We	 negoti 	 ate 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	go	around	looking	for	what	it	is	.
But	then	we	 negoti 	 ate 	 	on	what	they	're	going	to	get	paid	.
And	then	they	do	n't	have	a	regular	check	,	but	they	have	more	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	to	find	more	stuff	,	and	they	learn	the	skill	of	 negoti 	 ating 	 	,	and	they	learn	the	skill	of	 find 	 ing 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
You	breed	that	kind	of	stuff	.	 E 	 ach 	 	of	my	 kid 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	two	piggy	 bank 	 s 	 	.
Fifty	percent	of	all	the	money	that	they	earn	or	get	 gift 	 ed 	 	,	50	percent	 go 	 es 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	house	account	,	50	percent	 go 	 es 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 to 	 y 	 	account	.
 Any 	 thing 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 to 	 y 	 	account	they	can	 s 	 pend 	 	on	 what 	 ever 	 	they	want	.
The	50	percent	that	 go 	 es 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	house	account	,	every	six	 month 	 s 	 	,	 go 	 es 	 	to	the	bank	.
 The 	 y 	 	walk	up	with	me	.	Every	year	all	the	money	in	the	bank	 go 	 es 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	broker	.
 Bo 	 th 	 	my	 nine 	 - 	 	and	 seven 	 - 	 year 	 - 	 olds 	 	have	a	stock	broker	 al 	 ready 	 	.
But	I	'm	 teach 	 ing 	 	them	to	force	that	 saving 	 s 	 	habit	.
It	 drive 	 s 	 	me	crazy	that	30-year-olds	are	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	 May 	 be 	 	I	'll	start	 con 	 trib 	 uting 	 	to	my	 RS 	 P 	 	now	.	''
 Shi 	 t 	 	,	you	've	 mis 	 s 	 ed 	 	25	 year 	 s 	 	.
You	can	teach	 t 	 hose 	 	 habit 	 s 	 	to	young	 kid 	 s 	 	when	they	do	n't	even	feel	the	pain	yet	.
Do	n't	read	them	 bed 	 time 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	every	night	.
 May 	 be 	 	four	 night 	 s 	 	out	of	the	week	read	them	 bed 	 time 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	and	three	 night 	 s 	 	of	the	week	have	them	tell	 st 	 ories 	 	.
Why	do	n't	you	 s 	 it 	 	down	with	 kid 	 s 	 	and	give	them	four	 item 	 s 	 	,	a	red	shirt	,	a	blue	tie	,	a	kangaroo	and	a	 lap 	 top 	 	,	and	have	them	tell	a	story	about	 t 	 hose 	 	four	 thing 	 s 	 	?
My	 kid 	 s 	 	do	that	all	the	time	.
It	 teach 	 es 	 	them	to	sell	;	it	 teach 	 es 	 	them	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	;	it	 teach 	 es 	 	them	to	think	on	 the 	 ir 	 	feet	.
Just	do	that	kind	of	stuff	and	have	 f 	 un 	 	with	it	.
Get	 kid 	 s 	 	to	stand	up	in	front	of	 group 	 s 	 	and	talk	,	even	if	it	's	just	stand	up	in	front	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 friend 	 s 	 	and	do	 play 	 s 	 	and	have	 speech 	 es 	 	.
 T 	 hose 	 	are	 entrepreneur 	 ial 	 	 trait 	 s 	 	that	you	want	to	be	 nurtur 	 ing 	 	.
Show	the	 kid 	 s 	 	what	bad	 custom 	 ers 	 	or	bad	 employ 	 ees 	 	look	like	.
Show	them	the	 grum 	 py 	 	 employ 	 ees 	 	.
When	you	see	 grum 	 py 	 	 custom 	 er 	 	service	,	point	that	out	to	them	.
Say	,	``	By	the	way	,	that	guy	's	a	 crap 	 py 	 	 employ 	 ee 	 	.	''
And	say	,	``	 Th 	 ese 	 	 one 	 s 	 	are	good	 one 	 s 	 	.	''
If	you	go	 in 	 to 	 	a	restaurant	and	you	have	bad	 custom 	 er 	 	service	,	show	them	what	bad	 custom 	 er 	 	service	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
We	have	all	these	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	in	front	of	us	,	but	we	do	n't	take	 t 	 hose 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	;	we	teach	 kid 	 s 	 	to	go	get	a	tutor	.
 Imagin 	 e 	 	if	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	took	all	the	 kid 	 s 	 	'	junk	that	's	in	the	house	right	now	,	all	the	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	that	they	've	 out 	 grown 	 	two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Why	do	n't	we	start	selling	some	of	 th 	 is 	 	on	 Craig 	 s 	 list 	 	and	Kijiji	?	''
And	they	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	sell	it	and	learn	how	to	find	 scammer 	 s 	 	when	they	get	email	 off 	 ers 	 	come	in	.
 The 	 y 	 	can	come	 in 	 to 	 	your	account	or	a	sub	account	or	 what 	 ever 	 	.
But	teach	them	how	to	fix	the	price	,	guess	the	price	,	pull	up	the	 photo 	 s 	 	.
Teach	them	how	to	do	that	kind	of	stuff	and	make	money	.
 Th 	 en 	 	the	money	they	get	,	50	percent	 go 	 es 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	house	account	,	50	percent	 go 	 es 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 to 	 y 	 	account	.
My	 kid 	 s 	 	love	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	.
Some	of	the	 entrepreneur 	 ial 	 	 trait 	 s 	 	that	you	've	got	to	nurture	in	 kid 	 s 	 	:	 attain 	 ment 	 	,	 ten 	 a 	 city 	 	,	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	,	 intro 	 spect 	 ion 	 	,	 inter 	 depend 	 ence 	 	,	 value 	 s 	 	.
All	these	 trait 	 s 	 	you	can	find	in	young	 kid 	 s 	 	,	and	you	can	help	nurture	them	.
Look	for	that	kind	of	stuff	.
There	's	two	 trait 	 s 	 	that	I	want	you	to	 al 	 so 	 	look	out	for	that	we	do	n't	kind	of	get	out	of	 the 	 ir 	 	system	.
Do	n't	 medic 	 ate 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	for	attention	 defici 	 t 	 	 dis 	 order 	 	 un 	 less 	 	it	is	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 freak 	 ing 	 	bad	.
The	same	with	the	whole	 thing 	 s 	 	on	mania	and	stress	and	 depress 	 ion 	 	,	 un 	 less 	 	it	is	so	 clinic 	 ally 	 	brutal	,	man	.
 Bi 	 polar 	 	 dis 	 order 	 	is	 nick 	 named 	 	the	CEO	disease	.
When	 St 	 eve 	 	 Ju 	 r 	 vet 	 son 	 	and	Jim	 Clar 	 k 	 	and	Jim	 Bar 	 k 	 s 	 dale 	 	have	all	got	it	,	and	they	built	 Net 	 s 	 cape 	 	--	imagine	if	they	 we 	 re 	 	 give 	 n 	 	 Rit 	 al 	 in 	 	.
We	would	n't	have	have	that	stuff	,	right	?
Al	 Go 	 re 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	would	have	had	to	 invent 	 ed 	 	the	Internet	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	 skill 	 s 	 	are	the	 skill 	 s 	 	we	should	be	 teach 	 ing 	 	in	the	 class 	 room 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	else	.
I	'm	not	 say 	 ing 	 	do	n't	get	 kid 	 s 	 	to	want	to	be	 lawyer 	 s 	 	.
But	how	about	 get 	 ting 	 	 entrepreneur 	 ship 	 	to	be	 rank 	 ed 	 	right	up	there	with	the	rest	of	them	 a 	 s 	 	well	?
 Be 	 cause 	 	there	's	huge	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	in	that	.
I	want	to	close	with	a	quick	little	video	.
It	's	a	video	that	was	 d 	 one 	 	by	one	of	the	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	that	I	mentor	.

 Major 	 a 	 	 Car 	 ter 	 	:	3	 st 	 ories 	 	of	local	 eco 	 - 	 entrepreneur 	 ship 	 
So	 to 	 day 	 	,	I	'm	going	to	tell	you	about	some	people	who	did	n't	move	out	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 neighbor 	 hood 	 s 	 	.
The	first	one	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	right	here	in	 Chi 	 cago 	 	.
 Bren 	 da 	 	 Palm 	 s 	 - 	 Far 	 ber 	 	was	 hire 	 d 	 	to	help	 ex 	 - 	 convict 	 s 	 	 re 	 enter 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	and	keep	them	from	going	back	 in 	 to 	 	 pri 	 son 	 	.
 Current 	 ly 	 	,	 taxpayer 	 s 	 	 s 	 pend 	 	about	60,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	per	year	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	a	person	to	jail	.
We	know	that	 two 	 - 	 third 	 s 	 	of	them	are	going	to	go	back	.
I	find	it	 interest 	 ing 	 	that	,	for	every	one	dollar	we	 s 	 pend 	 	,	 how 	 ever 	 	,	on	early	 child 	 hood 	 	education	,	like	Head	Start	,	we	 s 	 ave 	 	17	 dollar 	 s 	 	on	stuff	like	 incarce 	 ration 	 	in	the	future	.
Or	--	think	about	it	--	that	60,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	is	more	than	what	it	 cost 	 s 	 	to	 s 	 end 	 	one	person	to	Harvard	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
But	 Bren 	 da 	 	,	not	 be 	 ing 	 	 phase 	 d 	 	by	stuff	like	that	,	took	a	look	at	her	 challeng 	 e 	 	and	came	up	with	a	 not 	 - 	 so 	 - 	 obvious 	 	solution	:	create	a	business	that	 produce 	 s 	 	skin	care	 product 	 s 	 	from	honey	.
 Oka 	 y 	 	,	it	might	be	obvious	to	some	of	you	;	it	was	n't	to	me	.

 N 	 ow 	 	,	I	'm	going	to	take	you	to	 Lo 	 s 	 	 Angel 	 es 	 	,	and	 lot 	 s 	 	of	people	know	that	 L. 	 A. 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	.
But	I	'm	going	to	talk	about	 L. 	 A. 	 	's	water	 issue 	 s 	 	right	now	.
 The 	 y 	 	have	not	 en 	 ough 	 	water	on	most	 day 	 s 	 	and	too	much	to	handle	when	it	 rain 	 s 	 	.
 Current 	 ly 	 	,	20	percent	of	California	's	energy	consumption	is	used	to	pump	water	 in 	 to 	 	 most 	 ly 	 	 South 	 ern 	 	California	.
 T 	 heir 	 	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	 load 	 s 	 	,	 load 	 s 	 	,	to	channel	that	 rain 	 water 	 	out	 in 	 to 	 	the	ocean	when	it	 rain 	 s 	 	and	 flood 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
 N 	 ow 	 	 And 	 y 	 	 Lip 	 ki 	 s 	 	is	 work 	 ing 	 	to	help	 L. 	 A. 	 	cut	 infra 	 structure 	 	 cost 	 s 	 	 associate 	 d 	 	with	water	management	and	urban	heat	 is 	 land 	 	--	 link 	 ing 	 	 tree 	 s 	 	,	people	and	technology	to	create	a	more	 liv 	 able 	 	city	.
All	that	green	stuff	 actual 	 ly 	 	 natural 	 ly 	 	 absorb 	 s 	 	storm	water	,	 al 	 so 	 	 help 	 s 	 	cool	our	cities	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	,	come	to	think	about	it	,	do	you	 re 	 ally 	 	want	 air 	 - 	 condition 	 ing 	 	,	or	is	it	a	 cool 	 er 	 	room	that	you	want	?
How	you	get	it	should	n't	make	that	much	of	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
So	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 L. 	 A. 	 	 Count 	 y 	 	 decide 	 d 	 	that	they	 need 	 ed 	 	to	 s 	 pend 	 	2.5	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	to	repair	the	city	 school 	 s 	 	.
And	 And 	 y 	 	and	his	team	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	 s 	 pend 	 	200	million	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 dollar 	 s 	 	on	asphalt	to	surround	the	 school 	 s 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
And	by	 present 	 ing 	 	a	 re 	 ally 	 	strong	economic	case	,	they	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	the	 L.

So	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	,	20	million	square	feet	of	asphalt	was	 replace 	 d 	 	or	 avoid 	 ed 	 	,	and	 electric 	 al 	 	consumption	for	 air 	 - 	 condition 	 ing 	 	went	down	,	while	 employ 	 ment 	 	for	people	to	maintain	 t 	 hose 	 	 ground 	 s 	 	went	up	,	 result 	 ing 	 	in	a	 net 	 - 	 saving 	 s 	 	to	the	system	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	 health 	 ier 	 	 student 	 s 	 	and	 school 	 s 	 	system	 employ 	 ees 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
 N 	 ow 	 	 Ju 	 dy 	 	 Bond 	 s 	 	is	a	coal	 min 	 er 	 	's	daughter	.
Her	family	 ha 	 s 	 	eight	 generation 	 s 	 	in	a	town	 call 	 ed 	 	 White 	 s 	 ville 	 	,	West	 Virgin 	 ia 	 	.
And	if	 any 	 one 	 	should	be	 cl 	 ing 	 ing 	 	to	the	 form 	 er 	 	 glor 	 y 	 	of	the	coal	 min 	 ing 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	and	of	the	town	,	it	should	be	 Ju 	 dy 	 	.
But	the	way	coal	is	 min 	 ed 	 	right	now	is	different	from	the	deep	 mine 	 s 	 	that	her	father	and	her	father	's	father	would	go	down	 in 	 to 	 	and	that	 employ 	 ed 	 	 essential 	 ly 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	and	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	two	dozen	men	can	tear	down	a	mountain	in	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 month 	 s 	 	,	and	 on 	 ly 	 	for	about	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	'	worth	of	coal	.
That	kind	of	technology	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 mountain 	 top 	 	removal	.	''
It	can	make	a	mountain	go	from	 th 	 is 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	in	a	few	short	 month 	 s 	 	.
Just	imagine	that	the	air	 surround 	 ing 	 	these	 place 	 s 	 	--	it	's	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	the	residue	of	 explosive 	 s 	 	and	coal	.
When	we	 visit 	 ed 	 	,	it	 g 	 ave 	 	some	of	the	people	we	 we 	 re 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	strange	little	cough	after	 be 	 ing 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	there	for	just	a	few	 hour 	 s 	 	or	so	--	not	just	 min 	 ers 	 	,	but	 every 	 body 	 	.
And	 Ju 	 dy 	 	saw	her	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 destroy 	 ed 	 	and	her	water	 poison 	 ed 	 	.
And	the	coal	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	just	move	on	after	the	mountain	was	 empti 	 ed 	 	,	 leav 	 ing 	 	even	more	 un 	 employ 	 ment 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	wake	.
But	she	 al 	 so 	 	saw	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	in	potential	wind	energy	on	an	 in 	 tact 	 	mountain	,	and	one	that	was	 reduc 	 ed 	 	in	 elev 	 ation 	 	by	over	2,000	feet	.
Three	 year 	 s 	 	of	 dirt 	 y 	 	energy	with	not	 man 	 y 	 	 job 	 s 	 	,	or	centuries	of	clean	energy	with	the	potential	for	 develop 	 ing 	 	 expert 	 ise 	 	and	 improve 	 ments 	 	in	efficiency	based	on	technical	 skill 	 s 	 	,	and	 develop 	 ing 	 	local	knowledge	about	how	to	get	the	most	out	of	that	region	's	wind	.
She	 calcul 	 ated 	 	the	 up 	 - 	 front 	 	cost	and	the	 pay 	 back 	 	over	time	,	and	it	's	a	 net 	 - 	 plus 	 	on	so	 man 	 y 	 	 level 	 s 	 	for	the	local	,	national	and	global	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
It	's	a	 long 	 er 	 	 pay 	 back 	 	than	 mountain 	 top 	 	removal	,	but	the	wind	energy	 actual 	 ly 	 	 pay 	 s 	 	back	 fore 	 ver 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	 mountain 	 top 	 	removal	 pay 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	little	money	to	the	 local 	 s 	 	,	and	it	 give 	 s 	 	them	a	lot	of	 mis 	 ery 	 	.
The	water	is	 turn 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 go 	 o 	 	.
 Mo 	 st 	 	people	are	still	 un 	 employ 	 ed 	 	,	 lead 	 ing 	 	to	most	of	the	same	 kind 	 s 	 	of	social	 problem 	 s 	 	that	 un 	 employ 	 ed 	 	people	in	inner	cities	 al 	 so 	 	experience	--	drug	and	alcohol	abuse	,	domestic	abuse	,	teen	 pregn 	 ancy 	 	and	poor	heath	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
 N 	 ow 	 	 Ju 	 dy 	 	and	I	--	I	have	to	say	--	 total 	 ly 	 	related	to	each	other	.
Not	 quit 	 e 	 	an	obvious	alliance	.
I	mean	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	her	 home 	 town 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	 White 	 s 	 ville 	 	,	West	 Virgin 	 ia 	 	.
I	mean	,	they	are	not	--	they	ai	n't	 com 	 pet 	 ing 	 	for	the	 birth 	 place 	 	of	hip	hop	title	or	 any 	 thing 	 	like	that	.
But	the	back	of	my	 T 	 - 	 shirt 	 	,	the	one	that	she	 g 	 ave 	 	me	,	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 Sav 	 e 	 	the	 en 	 danger 	 ed 	 	 hill 	 bill 	 ies 	 	.	''
So	 home 	 girl 	 s 	 	and	 hill 	 bill 	 ies 	 	we	got	it	together	and	 total 	 ly 	 	understand	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	's	all	about	.
But	just	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	ago	,	 Ju 	 dy 	 	was	 diagnos 	 ed 	 	with	 stage 	 - 	 three 	 	lung	cancer	.
Yeah	.
And	it	 ha 	 s 	 	since	 move 	 d 	 	to	her	 bone 	 s 	 	and	her	brain	.
And	I	just	find	it	so	bizarre	that	she	's	 suffer 	 ing 	 	from	the	same	thing	that	she	 tri 	 ed 	 	so	hard	to	protect	people	from	.
But	her	dream	of	 Co 	 al 	 	River	 Mount 	 ain 	 	Wind	is	her	 leg 	 acy 	 	.
And	she	might	not	get	to	see	that	 mountain 	 top 	 	.
But	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	writing	yet	some	kind	of	 manifest 	 o 	 	or	 some 	 thing 	 	,	she	's	 leav 	 ing 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	a	business	plan	to	make	it	happen	.
That	's	what	my	 home 	 girl 	 	is	 do 	 ing 	 	.
So	I	'm	so	proud	of	that	.
But	these	three	people	do	n't	know	each	other	,	but	they	do	have	an	awful	lot	in	common	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	all	problem	 solve 	 rs 	 	,	and	they	're	just	some	of	the	 man 	 y 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	that	I	 re 	 ally 	 	am	 privilege 	 d 	 	to	see	,	meet	and	learn	from	in	the	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	the	work	that	I	do	now	.
I	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 luck 	 y 	 	to	have	them	all	 feature 	 d 	 	on	my	 Corp 	 or 	 ation 	 	for	 Pub 	 lic 	 	Radio	radio	show	 call 	 ed 	 	 The 	 Pro 	 mis 	 ed 	 Land 	 .org 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	they	're	all	 ver 	 y 	 	practical	 vision 	 aries 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	take	a	look	at	the	 demand 	 s 	 	that	are	out	there	--	 beaut 	 y 	 	 product 	 s 	 	,	 health 	 y 	 	 school 	 s 	 	,	 electric 	 ity 	 	--	and	how	the	money	's	 flow 	 ing 	 	to	meet	 t 	 hose 	 	 demand 	 s 	 	.
And	when	the	 cheap 	 est 	 	 solution 	 s 	 	involve	 reduc 	 ing 	 	the	number	of	 job 	 s 	 	,	you	're	left	with	 un 	 employ 	 ed 	 	people	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	people	are	n't	cheap	.
In	fact	,	they	make	up	some	of	what	I	call	the	most	expensive	 citizen 	 s 	 	,	and	they	include	 generation 	 ally 	 	 imp 	 over 	 ish 	 ed 	 	,	 trauma 	 t 	 ized 	 	 vet 	 s 	 	 return 	 ing 	 	from	the	Middle	East	,	people	coming	out	of	jail	.
And	for	the	 veteran 	 s 	 	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	the	 V. 	 A 	 	.	 s 	 aid 	 	there	's	a	 six 	 - 	 fold 	 	 in 	 crease 	 	in	mental	health	 pharmaceutical 	 s 	 	by	 vet 	 s 	 	since	2003	.
I	think	that	number	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	going	to	go	up	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	not	the	largest	number	of	people	,	but	they	are	some	of	the	most	expensive	--	and	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	 like 	 li 	 hood 	 	for	domestic	abuse	,	drug	and	alcohol	abuse	,	poor	performance	by	 the 	 ir 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	in	 school 	 s 	 	and	 al 	 so 	 	poor	health	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	of	stress	.
So	these	three	 guy 	 s 	 	all	understand	how	to	 productive 	 ly 	 	channel	 dollar 	 s 	 	through	our	local	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	to	meet	 exist 	 ing 	 	market	 demand 	 s 	 	,	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	social	 problem 	 s 	 	that	we	have	now	and	prevent	new	 problem 	 s 	 	in	the	future	.
And	there	are	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	other	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	like	that	.
One	problem	:	waste	 hand 	 ling 	 	and	 un 	 employ 	 ment 	 	.
Even	when	we	think	or	talk	about	 recycl 	 ing 	 	,	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 recycl 	 able 	 	stuff	 end 	 s 	 	up	 get 	 ting 	 	 inciner 	 ated 	 	or	in	 land 	 fill 	 s 	 	and	 leav 	 ing 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 municipal 	 ities 	 	,	 divers 	 ion 	 	rates	--	they	 leav 	 e 	 	much	to	be	 recycl 	 ed 	 	.
And	where	is	 th 	 is 	 	waste	 handle 	 d 	 	?	 Us 	 ual 	 ly 	 	in	poor	 commun 	 ities 	 	.
And	we	know	that	 eco 	 - 	 industrial 	 	business	,	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	business	 model 	 s 	 	--	there	's	a	model	in	 Euro 	 pe 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 eco 	 - 	 industrial 	 	park	,	where	either	the	waste	of	one	company	is	the	raw	material	for	 an 	 other 	 	,	or	you	use	 recycl 	 ed 	 	 material 	 s 	 	to	make	 good 	 s 	 	that	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	use	and	sell	.
We	can	create	these	local	 market 	 s 	 	and	 incentive 	 s 	 	for	 recycl 	 ed 	 	 material 	 s 	 	to	be	used	 a 	 s 	 	raw	 material 	 s 	 	for	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	.
And	in	my	 home 	 town 	 	,	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	do	one	of	these	in	the	Bronx	,	but	our	mayor	 decide 	 d 	 	what	he	 want 	 ed 	 	to	see	was	a	jail	on	that	same	spot	.
 Fort 	 un 	 ate 	 ly 	 	--	 be 	 cause 	 	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	create	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 job 	 s 	 	--	but	after	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	,	the	city	 want 	 ed 	 	to	build	a	jail	.
 The 	 y 	 	've	since	 abandon 	 ed 	 	that	project	,	thank	 good 	 ness 	 	.
 An 	 other 	 	problem	:	 un 	 health 	 y 	 	food	 system 	 s 	 	and	 un 	 employ 	 ment 	 	.
 Work 	 ing 	 - 	 class 	 	and	poor	urban	 American 	 s 	 	are	not	 benefit 	 ing 	 	 economic 	 ally 	 	from	our	current	food	system	.
It	 re 	 lies 	 	too	much	on	 transport 	 ation 	 	,	chemical	 fertil 	 ization 	 	,	big	use	of	water	and	 al 	 so 	 	 refrige 	 ration 	 	.
Mega	 agricultur 	 al 	 	 operation 	 s 	 	often	are	 respons 	 ible 	 	for	 poison 	 ing 	 	our	 water 	 ways 	 	and	our	land	,	and	it	 produce 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 un 	 health 	 y 	 	product	that	 cost 	 s 	 	us	 billion 	 s 	 	in	 health 	 care 	 	and	lost	 product 	 ivity 	 	.
And	so	we	know	``	urban	ag	''	is	a	big	buzz	 top 	 ic 	 	 th 	 is 	 	time	of	the	year	,	but	it	's	 most 	 ly 	 	 garden 	 ing 	 	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	some	value	in	community	building	--	 lot 	 s 	 	of	it	--	but	it	's	not	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	creating	 job 	 s 	 	or	for	food	production	.
The	 number 	 s 	 	just	are	n't	there	.
Part	of	my	work	now	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 lay 	 ing 	 	the	 ground 	 work 	 	to	integrate	urban	ag	and	 r 	 ural 	 	food	 system 	 s 	 	to	 ha 	 sten 	 	the	 de 	 mise 	 	of	the	3,000-mile	 s 	 al 	 ad 	 	by	creating	a	national	brand	of	 urban 	 - 	 grown 	 	produce	in	every	city	,	that	uses	 region 	 al 	 	growing	power	and	 augment 	 s 	 	it	with	 in 	 door 	 	growing	 facil 	 ities 	 	,	owned	and	 oper 	 ated 	 	by	small	 grow 	 ers 	 	,	where	now	there	are	 on 	 ly 	 	 consumer 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	can	support	 season 	 al 	 	 farm 	 ers 	 	around	metro	 area 	 s 	 	who	are	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	out	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 re 	 ally 	 	ca	n't	meet	the	 year 	 - 	 round 	 	demand	for	produce	.
It	's	not	a	 com 	 petition 	 	with	 r 	 ural 	 	farm	;	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 reinforce 	 ments 	 	.
It	 al 	 lies 	 	in	a	 re 	 ally 	 	positive	and	 economic 	 ally 	 	 vi 	 able 	 	food	system	.
The	goal	is	to	meet	the	cities	'	 institution 	 al 	 	 demand 	 s 	 	senior	 center 	 s 	 	,	 school 	 s 	 	,	 day 	 care 	 	 center 	 s 	 	,	and	produce	a	network	of	 region 	 al 	 	 job 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	smart	 infra 	 structure 	 	.
And	how	we	manage	our	built	environment	 affect 	 s 	 	the	health	and	 well 	 - 	 be 	 ing 	 	of	people	every	single	day	.
Our	 municipal 	 ities 	 	,	 r 	 ural 	 	and	urban	,	play	the	 operation 	 al 	 	course	of	 infra 	 structure 	 	--	 thing 	 s 	 	like	waste	 dispos 	 al 	 	,	energy	demand	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	social	 cost 	 s 	 	of	 un 	 employ 	 ment 	 	,	 drop 	 - 	 out 	 	rates	,	 incarce 	 ration 	 	rates	and	the	 impact 	 s 	 	of	 vari 	 ous 	 	public	health	 cost 	 s 	 	.
Smart	 infra 	 structure 	 	can	provide	 cost 	 - 	 saving 	 	ways	for	 municipal 	 ities 	 	to	handle	both	 infra 	 structure 	 	and	social	 need 	 s 	 	.
And	we	want	to	shift	the	 system 	 s 	 	that	open	the	 door 	 s 	 	for	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	 form 	 er 	 ly 	 	tax	 burden 	 s 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	part	of	the	tax	base	.
And	imagine	a	national	business	model	that	 create 	 s 	 	local	 job 	 s 	 	and	smart	 infra 	 structure 	 	to	improve	local	economic	 st 	 ability 	 	.
So	I	'm	 hop 	 ing 	 	you	can	see	a	little	theme	here	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	 indic 	 ate 	 	a	trend	.
I	have	n't	 create 	 d 	 	it	,	and	it	's	not	 happen 	 ing 	 	by	accident	.
I	'm	 not 	 ic 	 ing 	 	that	it	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	all	over	the	country	,	and	the	good	news	is	that	it	's	growing	.
And	we	all	need	to	be	 invest 	 ed 	 	in	it	.
It	is	an	essential	pillar	to	 th 	 is 	 	country	's	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	.
And	I	call	it	``	 home 	 town 	 	security	.	''
The	 recess 	 ion 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	us	 reel 	 ing 	 	and	 fear 	 ful 	 	,	and	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	in	the	air	these	 day 	 s 	 	that	is	 al 	 so 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 empower 	 ing 	 	.
It	's	a	 real 	 ization 	 	that	we	are	the	key	to	our	own	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	is	the	time	for	us	to	act	in	our	own	 commun 	 ities 	 	where	we	think	local	and	we	act	local	.
And	when	we	do	that	,	our	 neighbor 	 s 	 	--	be	they	 next 	 - 	 door 	 	,	or	in	the	next	state	,	or	in	the	next	country	--	will	be	just	fine	.

 N 	 ow 	 	,	 home 	 town 	 	security	is	about	taking	care	of	your	own	,	but	it	's	not	like	the	old	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	 char 	 ity 	 	 begin 	 s 	 	at	home	.	''
I	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	read	a	book	 call 	 ed 	 	``	Love	 Lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	''	by	John	 Hop 	 e 	 	 Bryan 	 t 	 	.
And	it	's	about	 lead 	 ing 	 	in	a	world	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 do 	 es 	 	seem	to	be	 oper 	 ating 	 	on	the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	fear	.
And	 read 	 ing 	 	that	book	made	me	 re 	 examine 	 	that	 theor 	 y 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	I	need	to	explain	what	I	mean	by	that	.
See	,	my	dad	was	a	great	,	great	man	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	.
He	grew	up	in	the	 s 	 egreg 	 ated 	 	South	,	 es 	 cap 	 ed 	 	 ly 	 nch 	 ing 	 	and	all	that	 dur 	 ing 	 	some	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	 time 	 s 	 	,	and	he	 provide 	 d 	 	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 table 	 	home	for	me	and	my	 s 	 i 	 bling 	 s 	 	and	a	whole	bunch	of	other	people	that	fell	on	hard	 time 	 s 	 	.
But	,	like	all	of	us	,	he	had	some	 problem 	 s 	 	.
And	his	was	 gam 	 bling 	 	,	 compulsive 	 ly 	 	.
To	him	that	phrase	,	``	 Char 	 ity 	 	 begin 	 s 	 	at	home	,	''	 me 	 ant 	 	that	my	 pay 	 day 	 	--	or	 some 	 one 	 	else	's	--	would	just	happen	to	coincide	with	his	 luck 	 y 	 	day	.
So	you	need	to	help	him	out	.
And	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	I	would	loan	him	money	from	my	 after 	 - 	 school 	 	or	summer	 job 	 s 	 	,	and	he	 al 	 ways 	 	had	the	great	 intent 	 ion 	 	of	 pay 	 ing 	 	me	back	with	interest	,	of	course	,	after	he	hit	it	big	.
And	he	did	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	 believ 	 e 	 	it	or	not	,	at	a	 race 	 track 	 	in	 Lo 	 s 	 	 Angel 	 es 	 	--	one	reason	to	love	 L. 	 A. 	 	--	back	in	the	1940s	.
He	made	15,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	cash	and	 b 	 ought 	 	the	house	that	I	grew	up	in	.
So	I	'm	not	that	 un 	 happy 	 	about	that	.
But	listen	,	I	did	feel	 oblig 	 ated 	 	to	him	,	and	I	grew	up	--	then	I	grew	up	.
And	I	'm	a	grown	woman	now	,	and	I	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	a	few	 thing 	 s 	 	 a 	 long 	 	the	way	.
often	is	just	about	giving	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	're	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	,	or	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	what	you	've	 al 	 ways 	 	 d 	 one 	 	,	or	it	's	about	giving	 un 	 til 	 	it	 hurt 	 s 	 	.
I	'm	about	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	the	 mean 	 s 	 	to	build	 some 	 thing 	 	that	will	grow	and	 intens 	 ify 	 	 it 	 s 	 	original	 invest 	 ment 	 	and	not	just	 requir 	 e 	 	 great 	 er 	 	giving	next	year	--	I	'm	not	 try 	 ing 	 	to	feed	the	habit	.
I	 s 	 pent 	 	some	 year 	 s 	 	 watch 	 ing 	 	how	good	 intent 	 ions 	 	for	community	 empower 	 ment 	 	,	that	 we 	 re 	 	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	there	to	support	the	community	and	empower	it	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	left	people	in	the	same	,	if	not	 wo 	 rse 	 	,	position	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	in	before	.
And	over	the	past	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	've	 s 	 pent 	 	record	 amount 	 s 	 	of	 philanthro 	 pic 	 	 dollar 	 s 	 	on	social	 problem 	 s 	 	,	yet	 education 	 al 	 	 out 	 come 	 s 	 	,	 mal 	 nutrition 	 	,	 incarce 	 ration 	 	,	 obes 	 ity 	 	,	diabetes	,	income	 dis 	 par 	 ity 	 	,	they	've	all	gone	up	with	some	 exception 	 s 	 	--	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	infant	 mortal 	 ity 	 	among	people	in	poverty	--	but	it	's	a	great	world	that	we	're	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	them	 in 	 to 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
And	I	know	a	little	bit	about	these	 issue 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	for	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	,	I	 s 	 pent 	 	a	long	time	in	the	 non 	 - 	 profit 	 	industrial	complex	,	and	I	'm	a	 re 	 cover 	 ing 	 	 ex 	 ecutive 	 	director	,	two	 year 	 s 	 	clean	.
But	 dur 	 ing 	 	that	time	,	I	 real 	 ized 	 	that	it	was	about	 project 	 s 	 	and	 develop 	 ing 	 	them	on	the	local	level	that	 re 	 ally 	 	was	going	to	do	the	right	thing	for	our	 commun 	 ities 	 	.
But	I	 re 	 ally 	 	did	struggle	for	financial	support	.
The	 great 	 er 	 	our	success	,	the	less	money	came	in	from	 found 	 ations 	 	.
And	I	tell	you	,	 be 	 ing 	 	on	the	TED	stage	and	winning	a	 Mac 	 Arthur 	 	in	the	same	exact	year	 g 	 ave 	 	 every 	 one 	 	the	impression	that	I	had	 arriv 	 ed 	 	.
And	by	the	time	I	'd	 move 	 d 	 	on	,	I	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 cover 	 ing 	 	a	third	of	my	 age 	 ncy 	 	's	budget	 defici 	 t 	 	with	 s 	 peaking 	 	 fee 	 s 	 	.
And	I	think	 be 	 cause 	 	early	on	,	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	my	 program 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	just	a	little	bit	 a 	 head 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	time	.
But	since	then	,	the	park	that	was	just	a	dump	and	was	 feature 	 d 	 	at	a	 TED 	 200 	 6 	 	Talk	 be 	 came 	 	 th 	 is 	 	little	thing	.
But	I	did	in	fact	get	married	in	it	.
Over	here	.
There	 go 	 es 	 	my	dog	who	led	me	to	the	park	in	my	 wed 	 d 	 ing 	 	.
The	South	Bronx	 Green 	 way 	 	was	 al 	 so 	 	just	a	 draw 	 ing 	 	on	the	stage	back	in	2006	.
Since	then	,	we	got	about	50	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	in	 stimul 	 us 	 	package	money	to	come	and	get	here	.
And	we	love	 th 	 is 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	I	love	construction	now	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	 watch 	 ing 	 	these	 thing 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	happen	.
So	I	want	 every 	 one 	 	to	understand	the	critical	 import 	 ance 	 	of	shifting	 char 	 ity 	 	 in 	 to 	 	enterprise	.
I	 start 	 ed 	 	my	firm	to	help	 commun 	 ities 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	country	 real 	 ize 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	potential	to	improve	 every 	 thing 	 	about	the	quality	of	life	for	 the 	 ir 	 	people	.
 Home 	 town 	 	security	is	next	on	my	 to 	 - 	 do 	 	list	.
What	we	need	are	people	who	see	the	value	in	 invest 	 ing 	 	in	these	 type 	 s 	 	of	local	 enterprise 	 s 	 	,	who	will	partner	with	 folk 	 s 	 	like	me	to	identify	the	growth	 trend 	 s 	 	and	climate	 adapt 	 ation 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	understand	the	growing	social	 cost 	 s 	 	of	business	 a 	 s 	 	usual	.
We	need	to	work	together	to	embrace	and	repair	our	land	,	repair	our	power	 system 	 s 	 	and	repair	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
It	's	time	to	stop	building	the	 shop 	 ping 	 	 mall 	 s 	 	,	the	 pri 	 son 	 s 	 	,	the	 stad 	 ium 	 s 	 	and	other	 tribute 	 s 	 	to	all	of	our	 collect 	 ive 	 	 failure 	 s 	 	.
It	is	time	that	we	start	building	living	 monument 	 s 	 	to	hope	and	 possibil 	 ity 	 	.

Liz	 Cole 	 man 	 	's	call	to	 re 	 invent 	 	liberal	 art 	 s 	 	education
 Col 	 leg 	 e 	 	 pre 	 sidents 	 	are	not	the	first	people	who	come	to	mind	when	the	subject	is	the	uses	of	the	creative	 imagin 	 ation 	 	.
So	I	thought	I	'd	start	by	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	how	I	got	here	.
The	story	 begin 	 s 	 	in	the	late	'90s	.
I	was	 invit 	 ed 	 	to	meet	with	 lead 	 ing 	 	 educ 	 ators 	 	from	the	 new 	 ly 	 	free	 East 	 ern 	 	 Euro 	 pe 	 	and	Russia	.
 The 	 y 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	how	to	 re 	 build 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 un 	 ive 	 rs 	 ities 	 	.
Since	education	under	the	Soviet	 Un 	 ion 	 	was	 essential 	 ly 	 	 propag 	 and 	 a 	 	 serv 	 ing 	 	the	 purpose 	 s 	 	of	a	state	 ideo 	 logy 	 	,	they	 appreciate 	 d 	 	that	it	would	take	 whole 	 sale 	 	 transform 	 ations 	 	if	they	 we 	 re 	 	to	provide	an	education	worthy	of	free	men	and	women	.
 Giv 	 en 	 	 th 	 is 	 	rare	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	start	fresh	,	they	chose	liberal	 art 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	most	 compel 	 ling 	 	model	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 it 	 s 	 	historic	 commit 	 ment 	 	to	 further 	 ing 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 student 	 s 	 	'	 broad 	 est 	 	intellectual	,	and	 deep 	 est 	 	 ethic 	 al 	 	potential	.
 Hav 	 ing 	 	made	that	decision	they	came	to	the	 Unit 	 ed 	 	 Stat 	 es 	 	,	home	of	liberal	 art 	 s 	 	education	,	to	talk	with	some	of	us	most	 close 	 ly 	 	identified	with	that	kind	of	education	.
 The 	 y 	 	spoke	with	a	 pass 	 ion 	 	,	an	 urge 	 ncy 	 	,	an	intellectual	 convict 	 ion 	 	that	,	for	me	,	was	a	voice	I	had	not	heard	in	 decade 	 s 	 	,	a	dream	long	 for 	 gotten 	 	.
For	,	in	truth	,	we	had	 move 	 d 	 	light	 year 	 s 	 	from	the	 pass 	 ions 	 	that	 animate 	 d 	 	them	.
But	for	me	,	 un 	 like 	 	them	,	in	my	world	,	the	 s 	 late 	 	was	not	clean	,	and	what	was	written	on	it	was	not	 encourag 	 ing 	 	.
In	truth	,	liberal	 art 	 s 	 	education	no	 long 	 er 	 	 exist 	 s 	 	--	at	 l 	 east 	 	genuine	liberal	 art 	 s 	 	education	--	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	.
We	have	 professional 	 ized 	 	liberal	 art 	 s 	 	to	the	point	where	they	no	 long 	 er 	 	provide	the	 bread 	 th 	 	of	application	and	the	 enhance 	 d 	 	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	for	civic	 engage 	 ment 	 	that	is	 the 	 ir 	 	signature	.
Over	the	past	century	the	expert	 ha 	 s 	 	 dethron 	 ed 	 	the	educated	 general 	 ist 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	the	sole	model	of	intellectual	 accomplish 	 ment 	 	.
 Ex 	 pert 	 ise 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	for	 s 	 ure 	 	had	 it 	 s 	 	 moment 	 s 	 	.
But	the	price	of	 it 	 s 	 	 domin 	 ance 	 	is	enormous	.
 Sub 	 ject 	 	 matter 	 s 	 	are	broken	up	 in 	 to 	 	 small 	 er 	 	and	 small 	 er 	 	 piece 	 s 	 	,	with	increasing	 emphas 	 is 	 	on	the	technical	and	the	 obscur 	 e 	 	.
We	have	even	 manage 	 d 	 	to	make	the	 stud 	 y 	 	of	 liter 	 ature 	 	 arc 	 ane 	 	.
You	may	think	you	know	what	is	going	on	in	that	Jane	 Au 	 sten 	 	novel	--	that	is	,	 un 	 til 	 	your	first	 en 	 counter 	 	with	 post 	 modern 	 	 de 	 construction 	 ism 	 	.
The	 progress 	 ion 	 	of	 to 	 day 	 	's	college	student	is	to	jettison	every	interest	 ex 	 cept 	 	one	.
And	 with 	 in 	 	that	one	,	to	 continu 	 ally 	 	narrow	the	focus	,	 learn 	 ing 	 	more	and	more	about	less	and	less	;	 th 	 is 	 	,	 de 	 spite 	 	the	evidence	all	around	us	of	the	 interconnect 	 ed 	 ness 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 L 	 est 	 	you	think	I	 exagge 	 rate 	 	,	here	are	the	 begin 	 ning 	 s 	 	of	the	 A 	 - 	 B 	 - 	 C 	 s 	 	of	 anthropo 	 logy 	 	.
 A 	 s 	 	one	 move 	 s 	 	up	the	 lad 	 der 	 	,	 value 	 s 	 	other	than	technical	 compete 	 nce 	 	are	 view 	 ed 	 	with	increasing	 s 	 us 	 pic 	 ion 	 	.
 Quest 	 ions 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	,	``	What	kind	of	a	world	are	we	making	?
What	kind	of	a	world	should	we	be	making	?
What	kind	of	a	world	can	we	be	making	?	''
are	 treat 	 ed 	 	with	more	and	more	 skeptic 	 ism 	 	,	and	move	off	the	table	.
In	so	 do 	 ing 	 	,	the	 guard 	 ians 	 	of	secular	 demo 	 cracy 	 	in	effect	yield	the	 connect 	 ion 	 	between	education	and	 value 	 s 	 	who	,	you	can	be	 s 	 ure 	 	,	have	no	 com 	 pun 	 ction 	 s 	 	about	using	education	to	further	 the 	 ir 	 	 value 	 s 	 	:	the	 absolute 	 s 	 	of	a	 theo 	 cracy 	 	.
 Mean 	 while 	 	,	the	 value 	 s 	 	and	 voice 	 s 	 	of	 demo 	 cracy 	 	are	silent	.
 Ei 	 ther 	 	we	have	lost	touch	with	 t 	 hose 	 	 value 	 s 	 	or	,	no	better	,	 believ 	 e 	 	they	need	not	or	can	not	be	taught	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 a 	 version 	 	to	social	 value 	 s 	 	may	seem	at	 odd 	 s 	 	with	the	explosion	of	community	service	 program 	 s 	 	.
But	 de 	 spite 	 	the	attention	paid	to	these	 effort 	 s 	 	,	they	remain	 emphatic 	 ally 	 	extracurricular	.
In	effect	,	 civic 	 - 	 minded 	 ness 	 	is	 treat 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 out 	 side 	 	the	realm	of	what	 pur 	 port 	 s 	 	to	be	serious	 think 	 ing 	 	and	adult	 purpose 	 s 	 	.
 Sim 	 ply 	 	put	,	when	the	impulse	is	to	change	the	world	,	the	academy	is	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	 en 	 gender 	 	a	 learn 	 ed 	 	 help 	 lessness 	 	than	to	create	a	sense	of	 empower 	 ment 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	brew	--	 over 	 simpl 	 ification 	 	of	civic	 engage 	 ment 	 	,	 ideal 	 ization 	 	of	the	expert	,	 fragment 	 ation 	 	of	knowledge	,	 emphas 	 is 	 	on	technical	 master 	 y 	 	,	 neutral 	 ity 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	condition	of	academic	 integ 	 r 	 ity 	 	--	is	toxic	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	 pur 	 suing 	 	the	vital	 connect 	 ions 	 	between	education	and	the	public	good	,	between	intellectual	 integ 	 r 	 ity 	 	and	human	 free 	 dom 	 	,	which	 we 	 re 	 	at	the	heart	--	--	of	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	posed	to	and	by	my	European	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	.
When	the	astronomical	distance	between	the	 real 	 ities 	 	of	the	academy	and	the	 vision 	 ary 	 	 intens 	 ity 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 challeng 	 e 	 	 we 	 re 	 	more	than	 en 	 ough 	 	,	I	can	assure	you	,	to	give	one	pause	,	what	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	 out 	 side 	 	 high 	 er 	 	education	 W 	 he 	 ther 	 	it	was	 threat 	 s 	 	to	the	environment	,	 in 	 equ 	 ities 	 	in	the	 distribut 	 ion 	 	of	wealth	,	lack	of	a	 s 	 ane 	 	policy	or	a	 sustain 	 able 	 	policy	with	respect	to	the	 continu 	 ing 	 	uses	of	energy	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	in	desperate	 s 	 trait 	 s 	 	.
And	that	was	 on 	 ly 	 	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	.
The	 corrupt 	 ing 	 	of	our	 politic 	 al 	 	life	had	 be 	 come 	 	a	living	nightmare	;	 noth 	 ing 	 	was	exempt	--	 separat 	 ion 	 	of	 power 	 s 	 	,	civil	 liber 	 ties 	 	,	the	rule	of	law	,	the	relationship	of	church	and	state	.
 Accompan 	 ied 	 	by	a	 squander 	 ing 	 	of	the	nation	's	material	wealth	that	 defi 	 ed 	 	credulity	.
A	 har 	 row 	 ing 	 	 pre 	 d 	 ile 	 ction 	 	for	the	uses	of	force	had	 be 	 come 	 	 common 	 place 	 	,	with	an	equal	 dis 	 taste 	 	for	the	 alter 	 native 	 	 form 	 s 	 	of	influence	.
At	the	same	time	,	all	of	our	 fire 	 power 	 	was	 im 	 potent 	 	when	it	came	to	 halt 	 ing 	 	or	even	 stem 	 ming 	 	the	 s 	 laughter 	 	in	Rwanda	,	 Dar 	 fur 	 	,	 My 	 an 	 mar 	 	.
Our	public	education	,	once	a	model	for	the	world	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	most	 note 	 worthy 	 	for	 it 	 s 	 	 failure 	 s 	 	.
 Master 	 y 	 	of	 bas 	 ic 	 	 skill 	 s 	 	and	a	bare	 minim 	 um 	 	of	cultural	 liter 	 acy 	 	 elude 	 s 	 	vast	 number 	 s 	 	of	our	 student 	 s 	 	.
 De 	 spite 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	research	 establish 	 ment 	 	that	is	the	 en 	 vy 	 	of	the	world	,	more	than	half	of	the	American	public	do	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	in	evolution	.
And	do	n't	press	your	luck	about	how	much	 t 	 hose 	 	who	do	 believ 	 e 	 	in	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	understand	it	.
 Inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	nation	,	with	all	 it 	 s 	 	material	,	intellectual	and	spiritual	 resource 	 s 	 	,	to	reverse	the	 free 	 fall 	 	in	any	of	these	 area 	 s 	 	.
 Equ 	 ally 	 	 start 	 ling 	 	,	from	my	point	of	view	,	is	the	fact	that	no	one	was	 draw 	 ing 	 	any	 connect 	 ions 	 	between	what	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	to	the	body	politic	,	and	what	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	our	 lead 	 ing 	 	 education 	 al 	 	 institution 	 s 	 	.
We	may	be	at	the	top	of	the	list	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	 in 	 flu 	 encing 	 	access	to	personal	wealth	.
We	are	not	even	on	the	list	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	our	 respons 	 ibility 	 	for	the	health	of	 th 	 is 	 	 demo 	 cracy 	 	.

Our	ways	of	 approach 	 ing 	 	 age 	 ncy 	 	and	 author 	 ity 	 	turn	 in 	 side 	 	out	to	reflect	the	 re 	 ality 	 	that	no	one	 ha 	 s 	 	the	 answer 	 s 	 	to	the	 challeng 	 es 	 	facing	 citizen 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	century	,	and	 every 	 one 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	the	 respons 	 ibility 	 	for	 try 	 ing 	 	and	 particip 	 ating 	 	in	 find 	 ing 	 	them	.

The	idea	is	to	make	the	 politic 	 al 	 - 	 social 	 	 challeng 	 es 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	--	from	health	and	education	to	the	uses	of	force	--	the	 organize 	 rs 	 	of	the	curriculum	.

The	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 discover 	 y 	 	we	made	in	our	focus	on	public	action	was	to	appreciate	that	the	hard	 choice 	 s 	 	are	not	between	good	and	 e 	 vil 	 	,	but	between	 com 	 pet 	 ing 	 	 good 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 discover 	 y 	 	is	 transform 	 ing 	 	.

 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	 politic 	 al 	 	education	,	to	be	 s 	 ure 	 	.
But	it	is	a	 politic 	 s 	 	of	principle	,	not	of	 partisan 	 ship 	 	.
So	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	for	 Ben 	 ning 	 ton 	 	is	to	do	it	.

The	center	will	 em 	 body 	 	and	sustain	 th 	 is 	 	new	 education 	 al 	 	 commit 	 ment 	 	.
Think	of	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	kind	of	secular	church	.
The	 word 	 s 	 	on	the	card	 de 	 scribe 	 	what	will	happen	 in 	 side 	 	.
We	intend	to	turn	the	intellectual	and	 imagin 	 ative 	 	power	,	 pass 	 ion 	 	and	 bold 	 ness 	 	of	our	 student 	 s 	 	,	 facul 	 ty 	 	and	staff	to	 develop 	 ing 	 	 strat 	 egi 	 es 	 	for	 act 	 ing 	 	on	the	critical	 challeng 	 es 	 	of	our	time	.
So	we	are	 do 	 ing 	 	our	job	.
 Whi 	 le 	 	these	past	 week 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	a	time	of	national	 exhila 	 ration 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	,	it	would	be	tragic	if	you	thought	 th 	 is 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	your	job	was	 d 	 one 	 	.
The	 glaci 	 al 	 	silence	we	have	 experience 	 d 	 	in	the	face	of	the	 shred 	 d 	 ing 	 	of	the	 constit 	 ution 	 	,	the	 unravel 	 ing 	 	of	our	public	 institution 	 s 	 	,	the	 deterio 	 ration 	 	of	our	 infra 	 structure 	 	is	not	 limit 	 ed 	 	to	the	 un 	 ive 	 rs 	 ities 	 	.
We	the	people	have	 be 	 come 	 	 in 	 ur 	 ed 	 	to	our	own	 ir 	 relevance 	 	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	 do 	 ing 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	significant	about	 any 	 thing 	 	that	 matter 	 s 	 	 concern 	 ing 	 	 govern 	 ance 	 	,	beyond	 wait 	 ing 	 	 an 	 other 	 	four	 year 	 s 	 	.
We	persist	 al 	 so 	 	in	 be 	 ing 	 	 side 	 lined 	 	by	the	idea	of	the	expert	 a 	 s 	 	the	 on 	 ly 	 	one	 cap 	 able 	 	of	coming	up	with	 answer 	 s 	 	,	 de 	 spite 	 	the	 overwhelm 	 ing 	 	evidence	to	the	 contr 	 ary 	 	.
The	problem	is	there	is	no	 s 	 uch 	 	thing	 a 	 s 	 	a	 vi 	 able 	 	 demo 	 cracy 	 	made	up	of	 expert 	 s 	 	,	 zeal 	 ot 	 s 	 	,	 politic 	 ians 	 	and	 spect 	 ators 	 	.
People	will	 continu 	 e 	 	and	should	 continu 	 e 	 	to	learn	 every 	 thing 	 	there	is	to	know	about	 some 	 thing 	 	or	other	.
We	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	it	all	the	time	.
And	there	will	be	and	should	be	 t 	 hose 	 	who	 s 	 pend 	 	a	 life 	 time 	 	 pur 	 suing 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 high 	 ly 	 	defined	area	of	 inquir 	 y 	 	.
But	 th 	 is 	 	 single 	 - 	 minded 	 ness 	 	will	not	yield	the	 flex 	 ibilities 	 	of	mind	,	the	 multi 	 plicit 	 y 	 	of	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 s 	 	,	the	 cap 	 a 	 cities 	 	for	 collabor 	 ation 	 	and	 innov 	 ation 	 	 th 	 is 	 	country	 need 	 s 	 	.
That	is	where	you	come	in	.
What	is	certain	is	that	the	individual	talent	 exhibit 	 ed 	 	in	 s 	 uch 	 	abundance	here	,	 need 	 s 	 	to	turn	 it 	 s 	 	attention	to	that	 collabor 	 ative 	 	,	 mess 	 y 	 	,	 frust 	 rating 	 	,	 content 	 ious 	 	and	 im 	 possible 	 	world	of	 politic 	 s 	 	and	public	policy	.
 P 	 resident 	 	Obama	and	his	team	 simpl 	 y 	 	can	not	do	it	 al 	 one 	 	.
If	the	question	of	where	to	start	 seem 	 s 	 	 overwhelm 	 ing 	 	you	are	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	not	the	end	of	 th 	 is 	 	adventure	.

So	what	do	you	do	when	you	feel	 overwhelm 	 ed 	 	?
Well	,	you	have	two	 thing 	 s 	 	.
You	have	a	mind	.	And	you	have	other	people	.

I	want	to	talk	about	what	we	learn	from	 conserv 	 ative 	 s 	 	.
And	I	'm	at	a	stage	in	life	where	I	'm	 year 	 ning 	 	for	my	old	 day 	 s 	 	,	so	I	want	to	confess	to	you	that	when	I	was	a	kid	,	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	I	was	a	 conserv 	 ative 	 	.
I	was	a	Young	 Re 	 public 	 an 	 	,	a	Teenage	 Re 	 public 	 an 	 	,	a	 lead 	 er 	 	in	the	Teenage	 Re 	 public 	 an 	 s 	 	.

 N 	 ow 	 	,	I	know	what	you	're	 think 	 ing 	 	.
You	're	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	That	's	not	what	the	 Internet 	 s 	 	say	.	''
You	're	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	Wikipedia	 do 	 es 	 	n't	say	 th 	 is 	 	fact	.	''
And	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	one	of	the	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	the	junk	that	 flow 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 tube 	 s 	 	in	these	 Internet 	 s 	 	here	.

 In 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	it	 drive 	 s 	 	me	so	nuts	,	let	me	just	change	 th 	 is 	 	little	fact	here	.

 Oka 	 y 	 	,	but	no	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 be 	 side 	 s 	 	the	point	.
But	the	thing	I	want	you	to	think	about	when	we	think	about	 conserv 	 ative 	 s 	 	--	not	so	much	 th 	 is 	 	issue	of	the	1980	convention	--	the	thing	to	think	about	is	 th 	 is 	 	:	 The 	 y 	 	go	to	church	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	you	know	,	I	mean	,	a	lot	of	people	go	to	church	.
I	'm	not	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	that	 on 	 ly 	 	 conserv 	 ative 	 s 	 	go	to	church	.
And	I	'm	not	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	the	God	thing	.
I	do	n't	want	to	get	 in 	 to 	 	that	,	you	know	;	that	's	not	my	point	.
 The 	 y 	 	go	to	church	,	by	which	I	mean	,	they	do	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	for	free	for	each	other	.
 The 	 y 	 	hold	 pot 	 luck 	 	 d 	 inner 	 s 	 	.
 In 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	they	sell	 book 	 s 	 	about	 pot 	 luck 	 	 d 	 inner 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	serve	food	to	poor	people	.
 The 	 y 	 	share	,	they	give	,	they	give	away	for	free	.
And	it	's	the	 ver 	 y 	 	same	people	 lead 	 ing 	 	Wall	Street	 firm 	 s 	 	who	,	on	 Sun 	 day 	 s 	 	,	show	up	and	share	.
And	not	 on 	 ly 	 	food	,	right	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	same	people	are	strong	 believ 	 ers 	 	,	in	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 con 	 text 	 s 	 	,	in	the	 limit 	 s 	 	on	the	 market 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	are	in	 man 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 place 	 s 	 	against	 market 	 s 	 	.
 In 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	they	,	like	all	of	us	,	 celebr 	 ate 	 	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	relationship	.
But	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	keen	that	we	do	n't	let	money	drop	 in 	 to 	 	that	relationship	,	else	it	 turn 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	want	to	 regulat 	 e 	 	us	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 conserv 	 ative 	 s 	 	,	to	stop	us	from	 allow 	 ing 	 	the	market	to	spread	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 place 	 s 	 	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	they	understand	:	There	are	 place 	 s 	 	for	the	market	and	 place 	 s 	 	where	the	market	should	not	exist	,	where	we	should	be	free	to	enjoy	the	 fellow 	 ship 	 	of	 other 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	 recogn 	 ize 	 	:	 Bo 	 th 	 	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	have	to	live	together	.
And	the	second	great	thing	about	 conserv 	 ative 	 s 	 	:	they	get	 eco 	 logy 	 	.
Right	,	it	was	the	first	great	 Re 	 public 	 an 	 	 p 	 resident 	 	of	the	20th	century	who	taught	us	about	 environment 	 al 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	--	 T 	 ed 	 dy 	 	 Ro 	 osevelt 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	first	taught	us	about	 eco 	 logy 	 	in	the	 con 	 text 	 	of	natural	 resource 	 s 	 	.
And	then	they	 beg 	 an 	 	to	teach	us	in	the	 con 	 text 	 	of	 The 	 y 	 	understand	,	in	that	 con 	 text 	 	,	``	free	.	''	 The 	 y 	 	understand	``	free	''	is	an	 import 	 ant 	 	essential	part	of	the	cultural	 eco 	 logy 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
That	's	the	thing	I	want	you	to	think	about	them	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	I	know	you	do	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	me	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	here	.
So	here	's	exhibit	number	one	.
I	want	to	share	with	you	my	 lat 	 est 	 	hero	,	 Julia 	 n 	 	 San 	 ch 	 ez 	 	,	a	libertarian	who	 work 	 s 	 	at	the	,	for	 man 	 y 	 	people	,	``	 e 	 vil 	 	''	 Cat 	 o 	 	Institute	.
 Oka 	 y 	 	,	so	 Julia 	 n 	 	made	 th 	 is 	 	video	.
He	's	a	 terr 	 ible 	 	 produce 	 r 	 	of	 video 	 s 	 	,	but	it	's	great	content	,	so	I	'm	going	to	give	you	a	little	bit	of	it	.
So	here	he	is	 begin 	 ning 	 	.
 Julia 	 n 	 	 San 	 ch 	 ez 	 	:	I	'm	going	to	make	an	 observ 	 ation 	 	about	the	way	remix	culture	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	 evolv 	 ing 	 	...
 La 	 rry 	 	 Les 	 sig 	 	:	So	what	he	 do 	 es 	 	is	he	 begin 	 s 	 	to	tell	us	about	these	three	 video 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	fantastic	 Bra 	 t 	 	Pack	remix	set	to	 Liszt 	 o 	 mania 	 	.
 Whi 	 ch 	 	,	of	course	,	spread	 viral 	 ly 	 	.
 Hu 	 ge 	 ly 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	.
And	then	some	people	from	 Brook 	 lyn 	 	saw	it	.
 The 	 y 	 	 decide 	 d 	 	they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	the	same	.
And	then	,	of	course	,	people	from	San	 Frans 	 is 	 co 	 	saw	it	.
And	San	 Francis 	 can 	 s 	 	thought	they	had	to	do	the	same	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
And	so	they	're	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	libertarian	 ha 	 s 	 	some	 import 	 ant 	 	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	he	 want 	 s 	 	us	to	learn	from	 th 	 is 	 	.
 He 	 re 	 	's	 less 	 on 	 	number	one	.
 J 	 S 	 	:	There	's	 obvious 	 ly 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 deep 	 ly 	 	great	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	are	 act 	 ing 	 	in	the	sense	that	they	're	 emul 	 ating 	 	the	original	 mash 	 up 	 	.
And	the	guy	who	shot	it	 obvious 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	strong	eye	and	some	experience	with	video	 edit 	 ing 	 	.
But	 th 	 is 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	just	a	group	of	 friend 	 s 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	an	authentic	social	moment	and	 screw 	 ing 	 	around	together	.
It	should	feel	familiar	and	kind	of	 reson 	 ate 	 	for	 any 	 one 	 	who	's	had	a	 s 	 ing 	 - 	 a 	 - 	 long 	 	or	a	dance	party	with	a	group	of	good	 friend 	 s 	 	.
LL	:	Or	...
 J 	 S 	 	:	So	that	's	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	different	from	the	 ear 	 lier 	 	 video 	 s 	 	we	 look 	 ed 	 	at	 be 	 cause 	 	here	,	remix	is	n't	just	about	an	individual	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 al 	 one 	 	in	his	 base 	 ment 	 	;	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	an	act	of	social	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	.
And	it	's	not	just	that	it	 yield 	 s 	 	a	different	kind	of	product	at	the	end	,	it	's	that	 potential 	 ly 	 	it	 change 	 s 	 	the	way	that	we	 re 	 late 	 	to	each	other	.
All	of	our	normal	social	 interact 	 ions 	 	 be 	 come 	 	a	kind	of	 invit 	 ation 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	 collect 	 ive 	 	 express 	 ion 	 	.
It	's	our	real	social	 live 	 s 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	that	are	 trans 	 mut 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	art	.
LL	:	And	so	then	,	what	 th 	 is 	 	libertarian	 draw 	 s 	 	from	these	two	 point 	 s 	 	...
 J 	 S 	 	:	One	remix	is	about	 individual 	 s 	 	using	our	 share 	 d 	 	culture	 a 	 s 	 	a	kind	of	language	to	communicate	 some 	 thing 	 	to	an	audience	.
Stage	two	,	social	remix	,	is	 re 	 ally 	 	about	using	it	to	mediate	people	's	 relationship 	 s 	 	to	each	other	.
First	,	 with 	 in 	 	each	video	,	the	 Bra 	 t 	 	Pack	 character 	 s 	 	are	used	 a 	 s 	 	a	kind	of	template	for	 perform 	 ing 	 	the	social	 re 	 ality 	 	of	each	group	.
But	there	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	 dial 	 ogue 	 	between	the	 video 	 s 	 	,	where	,	once	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	structure	is	 establish 	 ed 	 	,	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	kind	of	platform	for	 articul 	 ating 	 	the	 similar 	 ities 	 	and	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	between	the	 group 	 s 	 	'	social	and	physical	 world 	 s 	 	.
LL	:	And	then	,	here	's	for	me	,	the	critical	key	to	what	 Julia 	 n 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	say	...
 J 	 S 	 	:	 Cop 	 y 	 right 	 	policy	is	n't	just	about	how	to	incentivize	the	production	of	a	certain	kind	of	 art 	 istic 	 	 commodit 	 y 	 	;	it	's	about	what	level	of	control	we	're	going	to	permit	to	be	 exercis 	 ed 	 	over	our	social	 real 	 ities 	 	--	social	 real 	 ities 	 	that	are	now	 inevit 	 ably 	 	 permeate 	 d 	 	by	pop	culture	.
I	think	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	that	we	keep	these	two	different	 kind 	 s 	 	of	public	 good 	 s 	 	in	mind	.
If	we	're	 on 	 ly 	 	focused	on	how	to	 maxim 	 ize 	 	the	supply	of	one	,	I	think	we	risk	 suppress 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	different	and	 rich 	 er 	 	and	,	in	some	ways	,	 may 	 be 	 	even	more	 import 	 ant 	 	one	.
LL	:	Right	.	 B 	 ing 	 o 	 	.	Point	.
 Free 	 dom 	 	 need 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	both	have	the	commercial	success	of	the	great	commercial	 work 	 s 	 	and	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	build	 th 	 is 	 	different	kind	of	culture	.
And	for	that	to	happen	,	you	need	 idea 	 s 	 	like	fair	use	to	be	central	and	 protect 	 ed 	 	,	to	 en 	 able 	 	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 innov 	 ation 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	libertarian	 tell 	 s 	 	us	,	between	these	two	creative	 culture 	 s 	 	,	a	commercial	and	a	sharing	culture	.
The	point	is	they	,	he	,	here	,	 get 	 s 	 	that	culture	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	my	concern	is	,	we	 Dem 	 s 	 	,	too	often	,	not	so	much	.
All	right	,	take	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	 th 	 is 	 	great	company	.
In	the	good	old	 day 	 s 	 	when	 th 	 is 	 	 Re 	 public 	 an 	 	ran	that	company	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 great 	 est 	 	work	was	work	that	built	on	the	past	,	right	.
All	of	the	great	Disney	 work 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 work 	 s 	 	that	took	 work 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	in	the	public	domain	and	 remix 	 ed 	 	them	,	or	 wait 	 ed 	 	 un 	 til 	 	they	 enter 	 ed 	 	the	public	domain	to	remix	them	,	to	 celebr 	 ate 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 add 	 - 	 on 	 	remix	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	.
 In 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	 Mick 	 ey 	 	 Mo 	 use 	 	 him 	 self 	 	,	of	course	,	 a 	 s 	 	``	 Steam 	 boat 	 	 Will 	 ie 	 	,	''	is	a	remix	of	the	then	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 domin 	 ant 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	popular	``	 Steam 	 boat 	 	Bill	''	by	 Bu 	 ster 	 	 Kea 	 ton 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	man	was	a	 remix 	 er 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 aire 	 	.
He	is	the	 celebr 	 ation 	 	and	ideal	of	 exact 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	.
But	then	the	company	 pass 	 es 	 	through	 th 	 is 	 	dark	stage	to	 th 	 is 	 	Democrat	.
 Wild 	 ly 	 	different	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	 master 	 mind 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	the	 event 	 ual 	 	 pass 	 age 	 	of	what	we	call	the	 Son 	 ny 	 	 Bo 	 no 	 	 Cop 	 y 	 right 	 	Term	 Ex 	 tension 	 	Act	,	 extend 	 ing 	 	the	term	of	 exist 	 ing 	 	 copy 	 right 	 s 	 	by	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	so	that	no	one	could	do	to	Disney	what	Disney	did	to	the	 Brother 	 s 	 	Grimm	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	when	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	 challeng 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	going	to	the	 Sup 	 re 	 me 	 	Court	,	 get 	 ting 	 	the	 Sup 	 re 	 me 	 	Court	,	the	bunch	of	 conserv 	 ative 	 s 	 	there	--	if	we	could	get	them	to	wake	up	to	 th 	 is 	 	--	to	strike	it	down	,	we	had	the	 assist 	 ance 	 	of	 No 	 bel 	 	Prize	 winner 	 s 	 	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 right 	 - 	 wing 	 	 No 	 bel 	 	Prize	winner	,	 Mil 	 ton 	 	 Fri 	 ed 	 man 	 	,	who	 s 	 aid 	 	he	would	join	our	brief	 on 	 ly 	 	if	the	word	``	no	 brain 	 er 	 	''	was	in	the	brief	 some 	 where 	 	.
But	 ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	,	no	 brain 	 s 	 	 exist 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	place	when	 Democrat 	 s 	 	 pass 	 ed 	 	and	 sign 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	bill	 in 	 to 	 	law	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	 tin 	 y 	 	little	 qui 	 bble 	 	of	a	 foot 	 note 	 	:	 Son 	 ny 	 	 Bo 	 no 	 	,	you	might	say	,	was	a	 Re 	 public 	 an 	 	,	but	I	do	n't	buy	it	.
 Th 	 is 	 	guy	is	no	 Re 	 public 	 an 	 	.
 Oka 	 y 	 	,	for	a	second	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	think	about	 th 	 is 	 	cultural	hero	,	icon	on	the	Left	,	creator	of	 th 	 is 	 	character	.
Look	at	the	 s 	 ite 	 	that	he	built	:	``	Star	 War 	 s 	 	''	 Mash 	 Up 	 s 	 	,	 invit 	 ing 	 	people	to	come	and	use	 the 	 ir 	 	creative	energy	to	produce	a	new	generation	of	attention	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 extra 	 ordinari 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	cultural	icon	.
Read	the	 licens 	 e 	 	.
The	 licens 	 e 	 	for	these	 remix 	 ers 	 	 assign 	 s 	 	all	of	the	 right 	 s 	 	to	the	remix	back	to	 Luc 	 a 	 s 	 	.
The	 mash 	 up 	 	is	owned	by	 Luc 	 a 	 s 	 	.
 In 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	 any 	 thing 	 	you	add	to	the	 mash 	 up 	 	,	music	you	might	add	,	 Luc 	 a 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 world 	 wide 	 	 perpetu 	 al 	 	right	to	exploit	that	for	free	.
There	is	no	creator	here	to	be	 recogn 	 ized 	 	.
The	creator	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	any	 right 	 s 	 	.
The	creator	is	a	sharecropper	in	 th 	 is 	 	story	.
And	we	should	remember	who	 employ 	 ed 	 	the	 sharecropper 	 s 	 	:	the	 Democrat 	 s 	 	,	right	?
So	the	point	is	the	 Re 	 public 	 an 	 s 	 	here	 recogn 	 ize 	 	that	there	's	a	certain	need	of	 owner 	 ship 	 	,	a	respect	for	 owner 	 ship 	 	,	the	respect	we	should	give	the	creator	,	the	 remix 	 er 	 	,	the	owner	,	the	 proper 	 ty 	 	owner	,	the	 copy 	 right 	 	owner	of	 th 	 is 	 	 extra 	 ordinari 	 ly 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	stuff	,	and	not	a	generation	of	 sharecropper 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	I	think	there	are	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	we	should	learn	here	,	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	about	 open 	 ness 	 	.
Our	 live 	 s 	 	are	sharing	 activ 	 ities 	 	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	in	part	.
Even	for	the	head	of	 Gold 	 man 	 	 S 	 ach 	 s 	 	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	in	part	.
And	for	that	sharing	activity	to	happen	,	we	have	to	have	 well 	 - 	 protect 	 ed 	 	 space 	 s 	 	of	fair	use	.
That	's	number	one	.	 Num 	 ber 	 	two	:	 Th 	 is 	 	 eco 	 logy 	 	of	sharing	 need 	 s 	 	 free 	 dom 	 	 with 	 in 	 	which	to	create	.
 Free 	 dom 	 	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 per 	 mission 	 	from	 any 	 one 	 	,	the	ability	to	create	.
And	number	three	:	We	need	to	respect	the	creator	,	the	creator	of	these	 remix 	 es 	 	through	 right 	 s 	 	that	are	 direct 	 ly 	 	 ti 	 ed 	 	to	them	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 explain 	 s 	 	the	 right 	 - 	 wing 	 	 non 	 profit 	 	 Cre 	 ative 	 	 Comm 	 on 	 s 	 	.
 Actu 	 ally 	 	,	it	's	not	a	 right 	 - 	 wing 	 	 non 	 profit 	 	,	but	of	course	--	let	me	just	tie	it	here	--	the	 Cre 	 ative 	 	 Comm 	 on 	 s 	 	,	which	is	 off 	 er 	 ing 	 	 author 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	simple	way	to	mark	 the 	 ir 	 	content	with	the	 free 	 dom 	 s 	 	they	 intend 	 ed 	 	to	carry	.
So	that	we	go	from	a	``	all	 right 	 s 	 	 re 	 serv 	 ed 	 	''	world	to	a	``	some	 right 	 s 	 	 re 	 serv 	 ed 	 	''	world	so	that	people	can	know	the	 free 	 dom 	 s 	 	they	have	 attach 	 ed 	 	to	the	content	,	building	and	creating	on	the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	creative	 copy 	 right 	 ed 	 	work	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	that	we	built	 en 	 able 	 	 th 	 is 	 	sharing	in	 part 	 s 	 	through	 licens 	 es 	 	that	make	it	clear	and	a	 free 	 dom 	 	to	create	 with 	 out 	 	 requir 	 ing 	 	 per 	 mission 	 	first	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 per 	 mission 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 grant 	 ed 	 	and	a	respect	for	the	creator	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 build 	 s 	 	 up 	 on 	 	a	 copy 	 right 	 	the	creator	 ha 	 s 	 	 licens 	 ed 	 	 free 	 ly 	 	.
And	it	 explain 	 s 	 	the	vast	 right 	 - 	 wing 	 	 conspi 	 racy 	 	that	's	 obvious 	 ly 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	around	these	 licens 	 es 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	now	more	than	350	million	digital	 object 	 s 	 	are	out	there	,	 licens 	 ed 	 	 free 	 ly 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	.
 N 	 ow 	 	that	picture	of	an	 eco 	 logy 	 	of	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	,	the	picture	of	an	 eco 	 logy 	 	of	 balanc 	 ed 	 	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	,	is	that	the	 eco 	 logy 	 	of	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	we	have	right	now	?
Well	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	all	know	,	not	 man 	 y 	 	of	us	 believ 	 e 	 	we	do	.
I	 trip 	 ped 	 	on	the	 re 	 ality 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 eco 	 logy 	 	of	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	just	last	week	.
I	 create 	 d 	 	a	video	which	was	based	on	a	 Wire 	 side 	 	Chat	that	I	'd	 give 	 n 	 	,	and	I	 upload 	 ed 	 	it	to	YouTube	.
I	then	got	 th 	 is 	 	email	from	YouTube	 weird 	 ly 	 	 not 	 ifying 	 	me	that	there	was	content	in	that	owned	by	the	 myster 	 ious 	 	 W 	 MG 	 	that	 match 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	content	ID	.
So	I	did	n't	think	much	about	it	.
And	then	on	Twitter	,	 some 	 body 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	,	``	Your	talk	on	YouTube	was	 DM 	 CA 	 	'd	.	 Wa 	 s 	 	that	your	purpose	?	''
 imagin 	 ing 	 	that	I	had	 th 	 is 	 	deep	 conspi 	 racy 	 	to	reveal	the	obvious	 flaw 	 s 	 	in	the	 DM 	 CA 	 	.
I	 answer 	 ed 	 	,	``	No	.	''	I	did	n't	even	think	about	it	.
But	then	I	went	to	the	 s 	 ite 	 	and	all	of	the	audio	in	my	 s 	 ite 	 	had	 be 	 en 	 	 silence 	 d 	 	.
My	whole	45-minute	video	had	 be 	 en 	 	 silence 	 d 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	there	 we 	 re 	 	 snip 	 pet 	 s 	 	in	that	video	,	a	video	about	fair	use	,	that	 include 	 d 	 	 War 	 ner 	 	Music	 Grou 	 p 	 	music	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	they	still	 s 	 old 	 	 ad 	 s 	 	for	that	music	,	if	you	 play 	 ed 	 	the	silent	video	.
You	could	still	buy	the	music	,	but	you	could	n't	hear	 any 	 thing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	had	 be 	 en 	 	 silence 	 d 	 	.
So	I	did	what	the	current	regime	 say 	 s 	 	I	must	do	to	be	free	to	use	YouTube	to	talk	about	fair	use	.
I	went	to	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 ite 	 	,	and	I	had	to	answer	these	 question 	 s 	 	.
And	then	in	an	 extra 	 ordinari 	 ly 	 	Bart	 Simpson 	 - 	 like 	 	,	juvenile	way	you	've	 actual 	 ly 	 	got	to	type	out	these	 word 	 s 	 	and	get	them	right	to	 re 	 assert 	 	your	 free 	 dom 	 	to	speak	.
And	I	felt	like	I	was	in	third	grade	 aga 	 in 	 	.
``	I	will	not	put	 tack 	 s 	 	on	the	teacher	's	chair	.
I	will	not	put	 tack 	 s 	 	on	the	teacher	's	chair	.	''
 Th 	 is 	 	is	absurd	.
It	is	 out 	 rage 	 ous 	 	.
It	is	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 per 	 version 	 	of	the	system	of	 free 	 dom 	 	we	should	be	 encourag 	 ing 	 	.
And	the	question	I	ask	you	is	:	Who	's	 fight 	 ing 	 	it	?
Well	,	 interest 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	in	the	last	 p 	 resident 	 ial 	 	election	,	who	was	the	number	one	,	active	opponent	of	 th 	 is 	 	system	of	 regulat 	 ion 	 	in	 on 	 line 	 	speech	?

And	we	're	not	going	to	see	 th 	 is 	 	change	in	 th 	 is 	 	system	 any 	 time 	 	soon	.
So	here	's	the	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	of	 open 	 ness 	 	that	I	think	we	need	to	learn	.
 Open 	 ness 	 	is	a	 commit 	 ment 	 	to	a	certain	set	of	 value 	 s 	 	.
We	need	to	speak	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 value 	 s 	 	.
The	value	of	 free 	 dom 	 	.	It	's	a	value	of	community	.
It	's	a	value	of	the	 limit 	 s 	 	in	 regulat 	 ion 	 	.
It	's	a	value	 respect 	 ing 	 	the	creator	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	if	we	can	learn	 t 	 hose 	 	 value 	 s 	 	from	at	 l 	 east 	 	some	 influence 	 s 	 	on	the	Right	,	if	we	can	take	them	and	 in 	 corporate 	 	them	,	 may 	 be 	 	we	could	do	a	little	trade	.
We	learn	 t 	 hose 	 	 value 	 s 	 	on	the	Left	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	they	'll	do	health	care	or	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	 legisl 	 ation 	 	or	 some 	 thing 	 	in	the	Right	.
 Any 	 way 	 	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	join	me	in	 teach 	 ing 	 	these	 value 	 s 	 	.
Thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.

 Brit 	 ta 	 	 Ri 	 ley 	 	:	A	garden	in	my	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 
I	,	like	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	,	am	one	of	the	two	billion	people	on	Earth	who	live	in	cities	.
And	there	are	 day 	 s 	 	--	I	do	n't	know	about	the	rest	of	you	 guy 	 s 	 	--	but	there	are	 day 	 s 	 	when	I	 palp 	 ably 	 	feel	how	much	I	 re 	 ly 	 	on	other	people	for	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 every 	 thing 	 	in	my	life	.
And	some	 day 	 s 	 	,	that	can	even	be	a	little	 scar 	 y 	 	.
But	what	I	'm	here	to	talk	to	you	about	 to 	 day 	 	is	how	that	same	 inter 	 depend 	 ence 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	an	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	social	 infra 	 structure 	 	that	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	harness	to	help	heal	some	of	our	 deep 	 est 	 	civic	 issue 	 s 	 	,	if	we	 app 	 ly 	 	open	source	 collabor 	 ation 	 	.
A	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	I	read	an	article	by	New	York	 Time 	 s 	 	writer	Michael	 Poll 	 an 	 	in	which	he	 argu 	 ed 	 	that	growing	even	some	of	our	own	food	is	one	of	the	best	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	can	do	for	the	environment	.
 N 	 ow 	 	at	the	time	that	I	was	 read 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	it	was	the	middle	of	the	winter	and	I	 definite 	 ly 	 	did	not	have	room	for	a	lot	of	dirt	in	my	New	York	City	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	.
So	I	was	 bas 	 ically 	 	just	 will 	 ing 	 	to	settle	for	just	 read 	 ing 	 	the	next	 Wire 	 d 	 	magazine	and	 find 	 ing 	 	out	how	the	 expert 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	figure	out	how	to	solve	all	these	 problem 	 s 	 	for	us	in	the	future	.
But	that	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	point	that	Michael	 Poll 	 an 	 	was	making	in	 th 	 is 	 	article	--	was	it	's	 precise 	 ly 	 	when	we	hand	over	the	 respons 	 ibility 	 	for	all	these	 thing 	 s 	 	to	 special 	 ists 	 	that	we	cause	the	kind	of	 mess 	 es 	 	that	we	see	with	the	food	system	.
So	,	I	happen	to	know	a	little	bit	from	my	own	work	about	how	 NAS 	 A 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	using	 hydroponic 	 s 	 	to	explore	growing	food	in	space	.
And	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	get	optimal	 nutrition 	 al 	 	yield	by	running	a	kind	of	 high 	 - 	 quality 	 	liquid	 s 	 oil 	 	over	 plant 	 s 	 	'	root	 system 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	to	a	 veget 	 able 	 	plant	,	my	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	got	to	be	about	 a 	 s 	 	foreign	 a 	 s 	 	 out 	 er 	 	space	.
But	I	can	 off 	 er 	 	some	natural	light	and	 year 	 - 	 round 	 	climate	control	.
 Fast 	 - 	 forward 	 	two	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	:	we	now	have	window	 farm 	 s 	 	,	which	are	 vert 	 ical 	 	,	hydroponic	 platform 	 s 	 	for	 food 	 - 	 growing 	 	 in 	 door 	 s 	 	.
And	the	way	it	 work 	 s 	 	is	that	there	's	a	pump	at	the	bottom	,	which	 period 	 ically 	 	 s 	 end 	 s 	 	some	of	 th 	 is 	 	liquid	nutrient	solution	up	to	the	top	,	which	then	 trick 	 les 	 	down	through	 plant 	 s 	 	'	root	 system 	 s 	 	that	are	 suspend 	 ed 	 	in	clay	 pel 	 lets 	 	--	so	there	's	no	dirt	 involve 	 d 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	light	and	temperature	vary	with	each	window	's	 micro 	 climate 	 	,	so	a	window	farm	 requir 	 es 	 	a	 farm 	 er 	 	,	and	she	must	decide	what	kind	of	 crop 	 s 	 	she	is	going	to	put	in	her	window	farm	,	and	 whet 	 her 	 	she	is	going	to	feed	her	food	 organ 	 ically 	 	.
Back	at	the	time	,	a	window	farm	was	no	more	than	a	 technical 	 ly 	 	complex	idea	that	was	going	to	 requir 	 e 	 	a	lot	of	 test 	 ing 	 	.
And	I	 re 	 ally 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	it	to	be	an	open	project	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 hydroponic 	 s 	 	is	one	of	the	 fast 	 est 	 	growing	 area 	 s 	 	of	 patent 	 ing 	 	in	the	 Unit 	 ed 	 	 Stat 	 es 	 	right	now	and	could	possibly	 be 	 come 	 	 an 	 other 	 	area	like	 Mon 	 s 	 ant 	 o 	 	,	where	we	have	a	lot	of	corporate	intellectual	 proper 	 ty 	 	in	the	way	of	people	's	food	.
So	I	 decide 	 d 	 	that	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	creating	a	product	,	what	I	was	going	to	do	was	open	 th 	 is 	 	up	to	a	whole	bunch	of	 co 	 - 	 develop 	 ers 	 	.
The	first	few	 system 	 s 	 	that	we	 create 	 d 	 	,	they	kind	of	 work 	 ed 	 	.
We	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	able	to	grow	about	a	 s 	 al 	 ad 	 	a	week	in	a	typical	New	York	City	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	window	.
And	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	grow	 cher 	 ry 	 	 tomato 	 es 	 	and	 cucumber 	 s 	 	,	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	stuff	.
But	the	first	few	 system 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	these	 leak 	 y 	 	,	loud	 power 	 - 	 guzzl 	 ers 	 	that	 Mart 	 ha 	 	 Stew 	 art 	 	would	 definite 	 ly 	 	never	have	approved	.
So	to	 br 	 ing 	 	on	more	 co 	 - 	 develop 	 ers 	 	,	what	we	did	was	we	 create 	 d 	 	a	social	media	 s 	 ite 	 	on	which	we	 publish 	 ed 	 	the	 design 	 s 	 	,	we	 explain 	 ed 	 	how	they	 work 	 ed 	 	,	and	we	even	went	so	far	 a 	 s 	 	to	point	out	 every 	 thing 	 	that	was	wrong	with	these	 system 	 s 	 	.
And	then	we	 invit 	 ed 	 	people	all	over	the	world	to	build	them	and	experiment	with	us	.
So	 actual 	 ly 	 	now	on	 th 	 is 	 	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	,	we	have	18,000	people	.
And	we	have	window	 farm 	 s 	 	all	over	the	world	.
What	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	is	what	 NAS 	 A 	 	or	a	large	corporation	would	call	R	&	D	,	or	research	and	 develop 	 ment 	 	.
But	what	we	call	it	is	R	&	 D 	 - 	 I 	 - 	 Y 	 	,	or	research	and	develop	it	 your 	 self 	 	.
So	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 Jack 	 son 	 	came	 a 	 long 	 	and	 suggest 	 ed 	 	that	we	use	air	 pump 	 s 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	water	 pump 	 s 	 	.
It	took	building	a	whole	bunch	of	 system 	 s 	 	to	get	it	right	,	but	once	we	did	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	cut	our	carbon	 foot 	 print 	 	 near 	 ly 	 	in	half	.
 T 	 ony 	 	in	 Chi 	 cago 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	taking	on	growing	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	like	 lot 	 s 	 	of	other	window	 farm 	 ers 	 	,	and	he	's	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	get	his	 straw 	 berries 	 	to	fruit	for	nine	 month 	 s 	 	of	the	year	in	 low 	 - 	 light 	 	 condition 	 s 	 	by	 simpl 	 y 	 	changing	out	the	 organ 	 ic 	 	 nutrient 	 s 	 	.
And	window	 farm 	 ers 	 	in	 Fin 	 land 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 custom 	 izing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	window	 farm 	 s 	 	for	the	dark	 day 	 s 	 	of	the	 Finn 	 ish 	 	 winter 	 s 	 	by	 out 	 fitting 	 	them	with	LED	grow	 light 	 s 	 	that	they	're	now	making	open	source	and	part	of	the	project	.
So	window	 farm 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 evolv 	 ing 	 	through	a	rapid	 version 	 ing 	 	process	similar	to	 soft 	 ware 	 	.
And	with	every	open	source	project	,	the	real	benefit	is	the	 inter 	 play 	 	between	the	specific	 concern 	 s 	 	of	people	 custom 	 izing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 system 	 s 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 part 	 icular 	 	 concern 	 s 	 	and	the	universal	 concern 	 s 	 	.
So	my	core	team	and	I	are	able	to	 concent 	 rate 	 	on	the	 improve 	 ments 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	benefit	 every 	 one 	 	.
And	we	're	able	to	look	out	for	the	 need 	 s 	 	of	 new 	 com 	 ers 	 	.
So	for	 do 	 - 	 it 	 - 	 your 	 self 	 ers 	 	,	we	provide	free	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 well 	 - 	 tested 	 	 instruct 	 ions 	 	so	that	 any 	 one 	 	,	 any 	 where 	 	around	the	world	,	can	build	one	of	these	 system 	 s 	 	for	free	.
And	there	's	a	patent	 pend 	 ing 	 	on	these	 system 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	that	's	held	by	the	community	.
And	to	fund	the	project	,	we	partner	to	create	 product 	 s 	 	that	we	then	sell	to	 school 	 s 	 	and	to	 individual 	 s 	 	who	do	n't	have	time	to	build	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 system 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	 with 	 in 	 	our	community	,	a	certain	culture	 ha 	 s 	 	 appear 	 ed 	 	.
In	our	culture	,	it	is	better	to	be	a	 test 	 er 	 	who	 support 	 s 	 	 some 	 one 	 	else	's	idea	than	it	is	to	be	just	the	idea	guy	.
What	we	get	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	project	is	we	get	support	for	our	own	work	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	an	experience	of	 actual 	 ly 	 	 con 	 trib 	 uting 	 	to	the	 environment 	 al 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	in	a	way	other	than	just	 screw 	 ing 	 	in	new	light	 bulb 	 s 	 	.
But	I	think	that	Eileen	 express 	 es 	 	best	what	we	 re 	 ally 	 	get	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	which	is	the	actual	joy	of	 collabor 	 ation 	 	.
So	she	 express 	 es 	 	here	what	it	's	like	to	see	 some 	 one 	 	 half 	 way 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	world	 hav 	 ing 	 	taken	your	idea	,	built	 up 	 on 	 	it	and	then	 acknowledg 	 ing 	 	you	for	 con 	 trib 	 uting 	 	.
If	we	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	see	the	kind	of	wide	consumer	behavior	change	that	we	're	all	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 a 	 s 	 	 environment 	 alist 	 s 	 	and	food	people	,	 may 	 be 	 	we	just	need	to	 d 	 itch 	 	the	term	``	consumer	''	and	get	 be 	 hind 	 	the	people	who	are	 do 	 ing 	 	stuff	.
Open	source	 project 	 s 	 	tend	to	have	a	 moment 	 um 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	.
And	what	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	is	that	R	&	 D 	 - 	 I 	 - 	 Y 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 move 	 d 	 	beyond	just	window	 farm 	 s 	 	and	 LED 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	solar	 pan 	 el 	 s 	 	and	aquaponic	 system 	 s 	 	.
And	we	're	building	 up 	 on 	 	 innov 	 ations 	 	of	 generation 	 s 	 	who	went	before	us	.
And	we	're	looking	 a 	 head 	 	at	 generation 	 s 	 	who	 re 	 ally 	 	need	us	to	 re 	 tool 	 	our	 live 	 s 	 	now	.
So	we	ask	that	you	join	us	in	 re 	 discover 	 ing 	 	the	value	of	 citizen 	 s 	 	 unit 	 ed 	 	,	and	to	declare	that	we	are	all	still	 pioneer 	 s 	 	.

In	 th 	 is 	 	 prophet 	 ic 	 	talk	from	2003	,	 robotic 	 ist 	 	 Rod 	 ney 	 	 Brook 	 s 	 	 talk 	 s 	 	about	how	 robot 	 s 	 	are	going	to	work	 the 	 ir 	 	way	 in 	 to 	 	our	 live 	 s 	 	--	 start 	 ing 	 	with	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	and	moving	 in 	 to 	 	 house 	 hold 	 	 chore 	 s 	 	...	and	beyond	.

 Rod 	 ney 	 	 Brook 	 s 	 	 say 	 s 	 	 robot 	 s 	 	will	 invad 	 e 	 	our	 live 	 s 	 
What	I	want	to	tell	you	about	 to 	 day 	 	is	how	I	see	 robot 	 s 	 	 invad 	 ing 	 	our	 live 	 s 	 	at	 multi 	 ple 	 	 level 	 s 	 	,	over	 multi 	 ple 	 	 time 	 scale 	 s 	 	.
And	when	I	look	out	in	the	future	,	I	ca	n't	imagine	a	world	,	500	 year 	 s 	 	from	now	,	where	we	do	n't	have	 robot 	 s 	 	 every 	 where 	 	.
 Assu 	 ming 	 	--	 de 	 spite 	 	all	the	 di 	 re 	 	 predict 	 ions 	 	from	 man 	 y 	 	people	about	our	future	--	 assum 	 ing 	 	we	're	still	around	,	I	ca	n't	imagine	the	world	not	 be 	 ing 	 	 populate 	 d 	 	with	 robot 	 s 	 	.
And	then	the	question	is	,	well	,	if	they	're	going	to	be	here	in	500	 year 	 s 	 	,	are	they	going	to	be	 every 	 where 	 	 soon 	 er 	 	than	that	?
 A 	 re 	 	they	going	to	be	around	in	50	 year 	 s 	 	?
Yeah	,	I	think	that	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	 like 	 ly 	 	--	there	's	going	to	be	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 robot 	 s 	 	 every 	 where 	 	.
And	in	fact	I	think	that	's	going	to	be	a	lot	 soon 	 er 	 	than	that	.
I	think	we	're	sort	of	on	the	 cus 	 p 	 	of	 robot 	 s 	 	 be 	 coming 	 	common	,	and	I	think	we	're	sort	of	around	1978	or	1980	in	personal	computer	 year 	 s 	 	,	where	the	first	few	 robot 	 s 	 	are	 start 	 ing 	 	to	appear	.
 Compu 	 ter 	 s 	 	sort	of	came	around	through	 game 	 s 	 	and	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	.
And	you	know	,	the	first	computer	most	people	had	in	the	house	may	have	 be 	 en 	 	a	computer	to	play	 P 	 ong 	 	,	a	little	 micro 	 processor 	 	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	,	and	then	other	 game 	 s 	 	that	came	after	that	.
And	we	're	 start 	 ing 	 	to	see	that	same	sort	of	thing	with	 robot 	 s 	 	:	LEGO	 Mind 	 storm 	 s 	 	,	 Fur 	 bie 	 s 	 	--	who	here	--	did	 any 	 one 	 	here	have	a	 Fur 	 by 	 	?
Yeah	,	there	's	38	million	of	them	 s 	 old 	 	 world 	 wide 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	are	 pre 	 tty 	 	common	.	And	they	're	a	little	 tin 	 y 	 	robot	,	a	simple	robot	with	some	 sensor 	 s 	 	,	a	little	bit	of	 process 	 ing 	 	 actu 	 ation 	 	.
On	the	right	there	is	 an 	 other 	 	robot	doll	,	who	you	could	get	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
And	just	 a 	 s 	 	in	the	early	 day 	 s 	 	,	when	there	was	a	lot	of	sort	of	amateur	 interact 	 ion 	 	over	 computer 	 s 	 	,	you	can	now	get	 vari 	 ous 	 	 hack 	 ing 	 	 kit 	 s 	 	,	 how 	 - 	 to 	 - 	 hack 	 	 book 	 s 	 	.
And	on	the	left	there	is	a	platform	from	Evolution	 Robot 	 ic 	 s 	 	,	where	you	put	a	PC	on	,	and	you	program	 th 	 is 	 	thing	with	a	 G 	 UI 	 	to	wander	around	your	house	and	do	 vari 	 ous 	 	stuff	.
And	then	there	's	a	 high 	 er 	 	price	point	sort	of	robot	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	--	the	 Son 	 y 	 	 Ai 	 bo 	 	.	And	on	the	right	there	,	is	one	that	the	NEC	 develop 	 ed 	 	,	the	 Pa 	 Pe 	 Ro 	 	,	which	I	do	n't	think	they	're	going	to	 re 	 lease 	 	.
But	 never 	 the 	 less 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	are	out	there	.
And	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	,	over	the	last	two	or	three	 year 	 s 	 	,	 lawn 	 - 	 mow 	 ing 	 	 robot 	 s 	 	,	 Hu 	 sqvarna 	 	on	the	bottom	,	 Friend 	 ly 	 	 Robot 	 ic 	 s 	 	on	top	there	,	an	Israeli	company	.
And	then	in	the	last	12	 month 	 s 	 	or	so	we	've	 start 	 ed 	 	to	see	a	bunch	of	 home 	 - 	 clean 	 ing 	 	 robot 	 s 	 	appear	.
The	top	left	one	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	nice	 home 	 - 	 clean 	 ing 	 	robot	from	a	company	 call 	 ed 	 	 Dy 	 son 	 	,	in	the	 U. 	 K 	 	.	 Ex 	 cept 	 	it	was	so	expensive	--	3,500	 dollar 	 s 	 	--	they	did	n't	 re 	 lease 	 	it	.
But	at	the	bottom	left	,	you	see	 Electro 	 lux 	 	,	which	is	on	sale	.
 An 	 other 	 	one	from	 Kar 	 cher 	 	.
At	the	bottom	right	is	one	that	I	built	in	my	lab	about	10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	we	 final 	 ly 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	that	 in 	 to 	 	a	product	.
And	let	me	just	show	you	that	.
We	're	going	to	give	 th 	 is 	 	away	I	think	,	Chris	 s 	 aid 	 	,	after	the	talk	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	robot	that	you	can	go	out	and	buy	,	and	that	will	clean	up	your	floor	.
And	it	 start 	 s 	 	off	sort	of	just	going	around	in	 ever 	 - 	 increasing 	 	 circle 	 s 	 	.
If	it	 hit 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	--	you	people	see	that	?
 N 	 ow 	 	it	's	 do 	 ing 	 	 wall 	 - 	 follow 	 ing 	 	,	it	's	 follow 	 ing 	 	around	my	feet	to	clean	up	around	me	.	Let	's	see	,	let	's	--	oh	,	who	stole	my	 R 	 ice 	 	 Kri 	 s 	 pies 	 	?	 The 	 y 	 	stole	my	 R 	 ice 	 	 Kri 	 s 	 pies 	 	!
Do	n't	worry	,	relax	,	no	,	relax	,	it	's	a	robot	,	it	's	smart	!
See	,	the	 three 	 - 	 year 	 - 	 old 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	,	they	do	n't	worry	about	it	.
It	's	 grown 	 - 	 up 	 s 	 	that	get	 re 	 ally 	 	 up 	 set 	 	.
We	'll	just	put	some	crap	here	.
 Oka 	 y 	 	.
I	do	n't	know	if	you	see	--	so	,	I	put	a	bunch	of	 R 	 ice 	 	 Kri 	 s 	 pies 	 	there	,	I	put	some	 penni 	 es 	 	,	let	's	just	shoot	it	at	that	,	see	if	it	 clean 	 s 	 	up	.
Yeah	,	 O 	 K 	 	.	So	--	we	'll	 leav 	 e 	 	that	for	 lat 	 er 	 	.
Part	of	the	trick	was	building	a	better	 clean 	 ing 	 	 mechan 	 ism 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	;	the	 intellig 	 ence 	 	on	board	was	 fair 	 ly 	 	simple	.
And	that	's	true	with	a	lot	of	 robot 	 s 	 	.
We	've	all	,	I	think	,	 be 	 come 	 	,	sort	of	 computation 	 al 	 	 chauvinist 	 s 	 	,	and	think	that	computation	is	 every 	 thing 	 	,	but	the	 mechanic 	 s 	 	still	matter	.
 He 	 re 	 	's	 an 	 other 	 	robot	,	the	 Pack 	 Bot 	 	,	that	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	building	for	a	bunch	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
It	's	a	 militar 	 y 	 	 sur 	 veil 	 lance 	 	robot	,	to	go	in	 a 	 head 	 	of	 troop 	 s 	 	--	looking	at	 cave 	 s 	 	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	.
But	we	had	to	make	it	 fair 	 ly 	 	 ro 	 bust 	 	,	much	more	 ro 	 bust 	 	than	the	 robot 	 s 	 	we	build	in	our	 lab 	 s 	 	.
On	board	that	robot	is	a	PC	running	Linux	.
It	can	 with 	 stand 	 	a	400G	shock	.	The	robot	 ha 	 s 	 	local	 intellig 	 ence 	 	:	it	can	flip	 it 	 self 	 	over	,	can	get	 it 	 self 	 	 in 	 to 	 	communication	range	,	can	go	 up 	 stair 	 s 	 	by	 it 	 self 	 	,	et	 ce 	 tera 	 	.
 Oka 	 y 	 	,	so	it	's	 do 	 ing 	 	local	 navig 	 ation 	 	there	.
A	soldier	 give 	 s 	 	it	a	command	to	go	 up 	 stair 	 s 	 	,	and	it	 do 	 es 	 	.
That	was	not	a	controlled	 d 	 escent 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	it	's	going	to	head	off	.
And	the	big	 break 	 through 	 	for	these	 robot 	 s 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	was	September	11th	.
We	had	the	 robot 	 s 	 	down	at	the	World	 Tra 	 de 	 	 Cent 	 er 	 	late	that	 even 	 ing 	 	.
 Cou 	 ld 	 	n't	do	a	lot	in	the	main	 rub 	 ble 	 	pile	,	 thing 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	just	too	--	there	was	 noth 	 ing 	 	left	to	do	.
But	we	did	go	 in 	 to 	 	all	the	 surround 	 ing 	 	 building 	 s 	 	that	had	 be 	 en 	 	 evacuate 	 d 	 	,	and	 search 	 ed 	 	for	possible	 surviv 	 ors 	 	in	the	 building 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	too	 danger 	 ous 	 	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	.
Let	's	run	 th 	 is 	 	video	.
 Re 	 port 	 er 	 	:	...	 battle 	 field 	 	 companion 	 s 	 	are	 help 	 ing 	 	to	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	combat	 risk 	 s 	 	.
Nick	 Ro 	 bert 	 son 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	that	story	.
 Rod 	 ney 	 	 Brook 	 s 	 	:	Can	we	have	 an 	 other 	 	one	of	these	?
 Oka 	 y 	 	,	good	.
So	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 corp 	 or 	 al 	 	who	had	 s 	 een 	 	a	robot	two	 week 	 s 	 	 previous 	 ly 	 	.
He	's	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	 robot 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 cave 	 s 	 	,	looking	at	what	's	going	on	.
The	robot	's	 be 	 ing 	 	 total 	 ly 	 	autonomous	.
The	worst	thing	that	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	cave	so	far	was	one	of	the	 robot 	 s 	 	fell	down	ten	 meter 	 s 	 	.
So	one	year	ago	,	the	US	 militar 	 y 	 	did	n't	have	these	 robot 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	they	're	on	active	duty	in	 Afghan 	 istan 	 	every	day	.
And	that	's	one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	they	say	a	robot	invasion	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
There	's	a	sea	change	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	how	--	where	technology	's	going	.
 Thank 	 s 	 	.
And	over	the	next	couple	of	 month 	 s 	 	,	we	're	going	to	be	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	 robot 	 s 	 	in	production	down	producing	oil	 well 	 s 	 	to	get	that	last	few	 year 	 s 	 	of	oil	out	of	the	ground	.
 Ver 	 y 	 	 hostil 	 e 	 	 environment 	 s 	 	,	150˚	C	,	10,000	 P 	 SI 	 	.
 Auto 	 nom 	 ous 	 	 robot 	 s 	 	going	down	,	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	work	.
But	 robot 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	they	're	a	little	hard	to	program	.
How	,	in	the	future	,	are	we	going	to	program	our	 robot 	 s 	 	and	make	them	 eas 	 ier 	 	to	use	?
And	I	want	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	use	a	robot	here	--	a	robot	named	Chris	--	stand	up	.	Yeah	.	 Oka 	 y 	 	.
Come	over	here	.	 N 	 ow 	 	notice	,	he	 think 	 s 	 	 robot 	 s 	 	have	to	be	a	bit	stiff	.
He	sort	of	 do 	 es 	 	that	.	But	I	'm	going	to	--	Chris	 And 	 er 	 son 	 	:	I	'm	just	 Brit 	 ish 	 	.	 R 	 B 	 	:	Oh	.
I	'm	going	to	show	 th 	 is 	 	robot	a	task	.	It	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	complex	task	.
 N 	 ow 	 	notice	,	he	 nod 	 d 	 ed 	 	there	,	he	was	giving	me	some	 indic 	 ation 	 	he	was	 understand 	 ing 	 	the	flow	of	communication	.
And	if	I	'd	 s 	 aid 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	bizarre	he	would	have	 look 	 ed 	 	 ask 	 ance 	 	at	me	,	and	 regulat 	 ed 	 	the	conversation	.
So	now	I	 br 	 ought 	 	 th 	 is 	 	up	in	front	of	him	.
I	'd	 look 	 ed 	 	at	his	 eye 	 s 	 	,	and	I	saw	his	 eye 	 s 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	bottle	top	.
And	I	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	task	here	,	and	he	's	 check 	 ing 	 	up	.
 Hi 	 s 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	are	going	back	and	forth	up	to	me	,	to	see	what	I	'm	looking	at	--	so	we	've	got	 share 	 d 	 	attention	.
And	so	I	do	 th 	 is 	 	task	,	and	he	 look 	 s 	 	,	and	he	 look 	 s 	 	to	me	to	see	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	next	.	And	now	I	'll	give	him	the	bottle	,	and	we	'll	see	if	he	can	do	the	task	.	Can	you	do	that	?
 Oka 	 y 	 	.	He	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	.	Yeah	.	Good	,	good	,	good	.
I	did	n't	show	you	how	to	do	that	.
 N 	 ow 	 	see	if	you	can	put	it	back	together	.
And	he	 think 	 s 	 	a	robot	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 low 	 	.
Good	robot	,	that	's	good	.
So	we	saw	a	bunch	of	 thing 	 s 	 	there	.
We	saw	when	we	're	 interact 	 ing 	 	,	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	show	 some 	 one 	 	how	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	,	we	direct	 the 	 ir 	 	visual	attention	.
The	other	thing	 communicate 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	internal	state	to	us	,	 whet 	 her 	 	he	's	 understand 	 ing 	 	or	not	,	 regulat 	 es 	 	a	social	 interact 	 ion 	 	.
There	was	 share 	 d 	 	attention	looking	at	the	same	sort	of	thing	,	and	 recogn 	 izing 	 	 social 	 ly 	 	 communicate 	 d 	 	 reinforce 	 ment 	 	at	the	end	.
And	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	put	that	 in 	 to 	 	our	lab	 robot 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	you	're	going	to	want	to	interact	with	 robot 	 s 	 	in	the	future	.
I	just	want	to	show	you	one	technical	 dia 	 gram 	 	here	.
The	most	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	for	building	a	robot	that	you	can	interact	with	 social 	 ly 	 	is	 it 	 s 	 	visual	attention	system	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	what	it	 pay 	 s 	 	attention	to	is	what	it	's	 see 	 ing 	 	and	 interact 	 ing 	 	with	,	and	what	you	're	 understand 	 ing 	 	what	it	's	 do 	 ing 	 	.
So	in	the	 video 	 s 	 	I	'm	about	to	show	you	,	you	're	going	to	see	a	visual	attention	system	on	a	robot	which	 ha 	 s 	 	--	it	 look 	 s 	 	for	skin	tone	in	 HS 	 V 	 	space	,	so	it	 work 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	all	human	 color 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
It	 look 	 s 	 	for	 high 	 ly 	 	 saturate 	 d 	 	 color 	 s 	 	,	from	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	.
And	it	 look 	 s 	 	for	 thing 	 s 	 	that	move	around	.
And	it	 weight 	 s 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	together	 in 	 to 	 	an	attention	window	,	and	it	 look 	 s 	 	for	the	 highest 	 - 	 s 	 cor 	 ing 	 	place	--	the	stuff	where	the	most	 interest 	 ing 	 	stuff	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	--	and	that	is	what	 it 	 s 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	then	segue	to	.
And	it	 look 	 s 	 	right	at	that	.
At	the	same	time	,	some	 top 	 - 	 down 	 	sort	of	stuff	:	might	decide	that	it	's	 lone 	 ly 	 	and	look	for	skin	tone	,	or	might	decide	that	it	's	 bor 	 ed 	 	and	look	for	a	 to 	 y 	 	to	play	with	.
And	so	these	 weight 	 s 	 	change	.
And	over	here	on	the	right	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	call	the	Steven	Spielberg	memorial	 modul 	 e 	 	.
Did	people	see	the	movie	``	AI	''	?
 R 	 B 	 	:	Yeah	,	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	,	but	--	remember	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	when	 Hale 	 y 	 	 Jo 	 el 	 	 O 	 s 	 ment 	 	,	the	little	robot	,	 look 	 ed 	 	at	the	blue	 fair 	 y 	 	for	2,000	 year 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	taking	his	 eye 	 s 	 	off	it	?
Well	,	 th 	 is 	 	 get 	 s 	 	rid	of	that	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 habitu 	 ation 	 	 Gaus 	 s 	 ian 	 	that	 get 	 s 	 	negative	,	and	more	and	more	 intens 	 e 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	 look 	 s 	 	at	one	thing	.
And	it	 get 	 s 	 	 bor 	 ed 	 	,	so	it	will	then	look	away	at	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
So	,	once	you	've	got	that	--	and	here	's	a	robot	,	here	's	Kismet	,	looking	around	for	a	 to 	 y 	 	.	You	can	tell	what	it	's	looking	at	.
You	can	estimate	 it 	 s 	 	 gaz 	 e 	 	direction	from	 t 	 hose 	 	 eye 	 ball 	 s 	 	 cover 	 ing 	 	 it 	 s 	 	camera	,	and	you	can	tell	when	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	the	 to 	 y 	 	.
And	it	's	got	a	little	bit	of	an	 emotion 	 al 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	here	.
But	it	's	still	going	to	pay	attention	if	 some 	 thing 	 	more	significant	 come 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 it 	 s 	 	field	of	view	--	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 Cy 	 nth 	 ia 	 	 Brea 	 zeal 	 	,	the	 build 	 er 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	robot	,	from	the	right	.
It	 s 	 ees 	 	her	,	 pay 	 s 	 	attention	to	her	.
Kismet	 ha 	 s 	 	an	 under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	,	 three 	 - 	 dimensional 	 	 emotion 	 al 	 	space	,	a	vector	space	,	of	where	it	is	 emotion 	 ally 	 	.
And	at	different	 place 	 s 	 	in	that	space	,	it	 express 	 es 	 	--	can	we	have	the	volume	on	here	?
Can	you	hear	that	now	,	out	there	?
Kismet	:	Do	you	 re 	 ally 	 	think	so	?	Do	you	 re 	 ally 	 	think	so	?
Do	you	 re 	 ally 	 	think	so	?
 R 	 B 	 	:	So	it	's	 express 	 ing 	 	 it 	 s 	 	emotion	through	 it 	 s 	 	face	and	the	 pro 	 so 	 dy 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	voice	.
And	when	I	was	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	my	robot	over	here	,	Chris	,	the	robot	,	was	 measur 	 ing 	 	the	 pro 	 so 	 dy 	 	in	my	voice	,	and	so	we	have	the	robot	measure	 pro 	 so 	 dy 	 	for	four	 bas 	 ic 	 	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	that	 mother 	 s 	 	give	 the 	 ir 	 	children	 pre 	 - 	 linguist 	 ically 	 	.
 He 	 re 	 	we	've	got	naive	 subject 	 s 	 	 p 	 raising 	 	the	robot	:	Voice	:	 Nic 	 e 	 	robot	.
You	're	 s 	 uch 	 	a	cute	little	robot	.
 R 	 B 	 	:	And	the	robot	's	 react 	 ing 	 	 appropriate 	 ly 	 	.
Voice	:	...	 ver 	 y 	 	good	,	Kismet	.
Voice	:	Look	at	my	 s 	 mile 	 	.
 R 	 B 	 	:	It	 s 	 mile 	 s 	 	.	She	 imit 	 ates 	 	the	 s 	 mile 	 	.	 Th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 s 	 	a	lot	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	naive	 subject 	 s 	 	.
 He 	 re 	 	we	 ask 	 ed 	 	them	to	get	the	robot	's	attention	and	 indic 	 ate 	 	when	they	have	the	robot	's	attention	.
Voice	:	Hey	,	Kismet	,	ah	,	there	it	is	.
 R 	 B 	 	:	So	she	 real 	 ize 	 s 	 	she	 ha 	 s 	 	the	robot	's	attention	.
Voice	:	Kismet	,	do	you	like	the	 to 	 y 	 	?	Oh	.
 R 	 B 	 	:	 N 	 ow 	 	,	here	they	're	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	prohibit	the	robot	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	first	woman	 re 	 ally 	 	 push 	 es 	 	the	robot	 in 	 to 	 	an	 emotion 	 al 	 	corner	.
Voice	:	No	.	No	.	You	're	not	to	do	that	.	No	.
Not	appropriate	.	No	.	No	.
 R 	 B 	 	:	I	'm	going	to	 leav 	 e 	 	it	at	that	.
We	put	that	together	.	 Th 	 en 	 	we	put	in	turn	taking	.
When	we	talk	to	 some 	 one 	 	,	we	talk	.
 Th 	 en 	 	we	sort	of	raise	our	 eye 	 brow 	 s 	 	,	move	our	 eye 	 s 	 	,	give	the	other	person	the	idea	it	's	 the 	 ir 	 	turn	to	talk	.
And	then	they	talk	,	and	then	we	pass	the	 ba 	 ton 	 	back	and	forth	between	each	other	.
So	we	put	 th 	 is 	 	in	the	robot	.
We	got	a	bunch	of	naive	 subject 	 s 	 	in	,	we	did	n't	tell	them	 any 	 thing 	 	about	the	robot	,	 s 	 at 	 	them	down	in	front	of	the	robot	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	talk	to	the	robot	.
 N 	 ow 	 	what	they	did	n't	know	was	,	the	robot	was	n't	 understand 	 ing 	 	a	word	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	and	that	the	robot	was	n't	 s 	 peaking 	 	English	.
It	was	just	 say 	 ing 	 	random	English	 phone 	 me 	 s 	 	.
And	I	want	you	to	watch	 care 	 fully 	 	,	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	where	 th 	 is 	 	person	,	 Rit 	 chie 	 	,	who	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	talk	to	the	robot	for	25	 minute 	 s 	 	--	--	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	I	want	to	show	you	 some 	 thing 	 	.
I	want	to	show	you	my	watch	.	''
And	he	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	the	watch	center	,	 in 	 to 	 	the	robot	's	field	of	vision	,	 point 	 s 	 	to	it	,	 give 	 s 	 	it	a	motion	cue	,	and	the	robot	 look 	 s 	 	at	the	watch	 quit 	 e 	 	 success 	 fully 	 	.
We	do	n't	know	 whet 	 her 	 	he	 under 	 stood 	 	or	not	that	the	robot	--	 Not 	 ice 	 	the	 turn 	 - 	 taking 	 	.
 Rit 	 chie 	 	:	 O 	 K 	 	,	I	want	to	show	you	 some 	 thing 	 	.	 O 	 K 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	watch	that	my	girlfriend	 g 	 ave 	 	me	.
Robot	:	Oh	,	cool	.
 Rit 	 chie 	 	:	Yeah	,	look	,	it	's	got	a	little	blue	light	in	it	too	.	I	 al 	 most 	 	lost	it	 th 	 is 	 	week	.
 R 	 B 	 	:	So	it	's	making	eye	contact	with	him	,	 follow 	 ing 	 	his	 eye 	 s 	 	.
 Rit 	 chie 	 	:	Can	you	do	the	same	thing	?	Robot	:	Yeah	,	 s 	 ure 	 	.
 R 	 B 	 	:	And	they	 success 	 fully 	 	have	that	sort	of	communication	.
And	here	's	 an 	 other 	 	 a 	 spect 	 	of	the	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	Chris	and	I	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	robot	,	Cog	.
 The 	 y 	 	first	make	eye	contact	,	and	then	,	when	 Christi 	 e 	 	 look 	 s 	 	over	at	 th 	 is 	 	 to 	 y 	 	,	the	robot	 estimate 	 s 	 	her	 gaz 	 e 	 	direction	and	 look 	 s 	 	at	the	same	thing	that	she	's	looking	at	.
So	we	're	going	to	see	more	and	more	of	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	robot	over	the	next	few	 year 	 s 	 	in	 lab 	 s 	 	.
But	then	the	big	 question 	 s 	 	,	two	big	 question 	 s 	 	that	people	ask	me	are	:	if	we	make	these	 robot 	 s 	 	more	and	more	 human 	 - 	 like 	 	,	will	we	accept	them	,	will	we	--	will	they	need	 right 	 s 	 	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	?
And	the	other	question	people	ask	me	is	,	will	they	want	to	take	over	?
And	on	the	first	--	you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 Hol 	 ly 	 wood 	 	theme	with	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 movie 	 s 	 	.	You	 prob 	 ably 	 	 recogn 	 ize 	 	these	 character 	 s 	 	here	--	where	in	each	of	these	 case 	 s 	 	,	the	 robot 	 s 	 	want	more	respect	.
Well	,	do	you	ever	need	to	give	 robot 	 s 	 	respect	?
 The 	 y 	 	're	just	 machine 	 s 	 	,	after	all	.
But	I	think	,	you	know	,	we	have	to	accept	that	we	are	just	 machine 	 s 	 	.
After	all	,	that	's	 certain 	 ly 	 	what	modern	 mole 	 cular 	 	biology	 say 	 s 	 	about	us	.
You	do	n't	see	a	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	of	how	,	you	know	,	 Mole 	 cule 	 	A	,	you	know	,	 come 	 s 	 	up	and	 dock 	 s 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	other	molecule	.
And	it	's	moving	forward	,	you	know	,	 propel 	 led 	 	by	 vari 	 ous 	 	 charge 	 s 	 	,	and	then	the	soul	 step 	 s 	 	in	and	 tweak 	 s 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 molecule 	 s 	 	so	that	they	connect	.
It	's	all	 mechan 	 istic 	 	.	We	are	 mechan 	 ism 	 	.
If	we	are	 machine 	 s 	 	,	then	in	principle	at	 l 	 east 	 	,	we	should	be	able	to	build	 machine 	 s 	 	out	of	other	stuff	,	which	are	just	 a 	 s 	 	 al 	 ive 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	are	.
But	I	think	for	us	to	admit	that	,	we	have	to	give	up	on	our	 special 	 - 	 ness 	 	,	in	a	certain	way	.
And	we	've	had	the	 re 	 treat 	 	from	 special 	 - 	 ness 	 	under	the	 bar 	 rage 	 	of	science	and	technology	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	over	the	last	few	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	.
500	 year 	 s 	 	ago	we	had	to	give	up	the	idea	that	we	are	the	center	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	when	the	earth	 start 	 ed 	 	to	go	around	the	 s 	 un 	 	;	150	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	with	Darwin	,	we	had	to	give	up	the	idea	we	 we 	 re 	 	different	from	 animal 	 s 	 	.
And	to	imagine	--	you	know	,	it	's	 al 	 ways 	 	hard	for	us	.
 Re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 batt 	 er 	 ed 	 	with	the	idea	that	 may 	 be 	 	we	did	n't	even	have	our	own	creation	event	,	here	on	earth	,	which	people	did	n't	like	much	.	And	then	the	human	genome	 s 	 aid 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	we	 on 	 ly 	 	have	35,000	 gene 	 s 	 	.	And	that	was	 re 	 ally 	 	--	people	did	n't	like	that	,	we	've	got	more	 gene 	 s 	 	than	that	.
We	do	n't	like	to	give	up	our	 special 	 - 	 ness 	 	,	so	,	you	know	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	the	idea	that	 robot 	 s 	 	could	 re 	 ally 	 	have	 emotion 	 s 	 	,	or	that	 robot 	 s 	 	could	be	living	 creature 	 s 	 	--	I	think	is	going	to	be	hard	for	us	to	accept	.
But	we	're	going	to	come	to	accept	it	over	the	next	50	 year 	 s 	 	or	so	.
And	the	second	question	is	,	will	the	 machine 	 s 	 	want	to	take	over	?
And	here	the	standard	scenario	is	that	we	create	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	they	grow	,	we	nurture	them	,	they	learn	a	lot	from	us	,	and	then	they	start	to	decide	that	we	're	 pre 	 tty 	 	 bor 	 ing 	 	,	 s 	 low 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	want	to	take	over	from	us	.
And	for	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	that	have	 teenager 	 s 	 	,	you	know	what	that	's	like	.
But	 Hol 	 ly 	 wood 	 	 extend 	 s 	 	it	to	the	 robot 	 s 	 	.
And	the	question	is	,	you	know	,	will	 some 	 one 	 	 accident 	 ally 	 	build	a	robot	that	 take 	 s 	 	over	from	us	?
And	that	's	sort	of	like	 th 	 is 	 	lone	guy	in	the	 back 	 yard 	 	,	you	know	--	``	I	 accident 	 ally 	 	built	a	747	.	''
I	do	n't	think	that	's	going	to	happen	.
And	I	do	n't	think	--	--	I	do	n't	think	we	're	going	to	 de 	 liberate 	 ly 	 	build	 robot 	 s 	 	that	we	're	 un 	 comfort 	 able 	 	with	.
We	'll	--	you	know	,	they	're	not	going	to	have	a	super	bad	robot	.
 Be 	 fore 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	to	come	to	be	a	 mild 	 ly 	 	bad	robot	,	and	before	that	a	not	so	bad	robot	.
And	we	're	just	not	going	to	let	it	go	that	way	.
So	,	I	think	I	'm	going	to	 leav 	 e 	 	it	at	that	:	the	 robot 	 s 	 	are	coming	,	we	do	n't	have	too	much	to	worry	about	,	it	's	going	to	be	a	lot	of	 f 	 un 	 	,	and	I	hope	you	all	enjoy	the	journey	over	the	next	50	 year 	 s 	 	.

 Al 	 ex 	 is 	 	 O 	 han 	 ian 	 	:	How	to	make	a	splash	in	social	media
So	,	now	,	there	are	a	lot	of	web	2.0	 consult 	 ants 	 	who	make	a	lot	of	money	.
In	fact	,	they	make	 the 	 ir 	 	 living 	 s 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	stuff	.
I	'm	going	to	try	and	 s 	 ave 	 	you	all	the	time	and	all	the	money	and	go	through	it	in	the	next	three	 minute 	 s 	 	,	so	bear	with	me	.
 Start 	 ed 	 	a	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	back	in	2005	,	with	a	few	 friend 	 s 	 	of	mine	,	 call 	 ed 	 	 Reddit 	 .com 	 	.
That	's	what	you	'd	call	a	social	news	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	.
 Bas 	 ically 	 	all	that	 mean 	 s 	 	is	that	the	 democrat 	 ic 	 	front	page	is	the	best	stuff	on	the	web	.	You	find	some	 interest 	 ing 	 	content	,	say	a	 TED 	 Talk 	 	,	submit	it	to	Reddit	,	and	the	community	of	your	 peer 	 s 	 	will	vote	it	up	if	they	like	it	,	vote	it	down	if	they	do	n't	.
And	that	 create 	 s 	 	the	front	page	.	It	's	 al 	 ways 	 	 ris 	 ing 	 	,	 fall 	 ing 	 	,	 al 	 ways 	 	changing	.
 Ab 	 out 	 	a	half	million	people	visit	every	day	.	But	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	about	Reddit	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	about	 discover 	 ing 	 	new	 thing 	 s 	 	that	pop	up	on	the	web	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	in	the	last	four	 year 	 s 	 	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 meme 	 s 	 	,	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 trend 	 s 	 	get	born	right	on	our	front	page	.
But	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	even	about	Reddit	 it 	 self 	 	.
It	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	about	 hump 	 back 	 	 whale 	 s 	 	.
Well	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	 technical 	 ly 	 	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	about	 Green 	 peace 	 	,	which	is	an	 environment 	 al 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 	that	 want 	 ed 	 	to	stop	the	 Japan 	 ese 	 	government	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 whal 	 ing 	 	campaign	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	 hump 	 back 	 	 whale 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 kill 	 ed 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	put	an	end	to	it	.	And	one	of	the	ways	they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	it	was	to	put	a	 track 	 ing 	 	chip	 in 	 side 	 	one	of	these	 hump 	 back 	 	 whale 	 s 	 	.
But	to	 re 	 ally 	 	kind	of	 person 	 ify 	 	the	 move 	 ment 	 	,	they	 want 	 ed 	 	to	name	it	.
So	,	in	true	web	fashion	they	put	together	a	poll	where	they	had	a	bunch	of	 ver 	 y 	 	erudite	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 thought 	 ful 	 	,	 culture 	 d 	 	 name 	 s 	 	.
I	 believ 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 Far 	 s 	 i 	 	word	for	``	 im 	 mortal 	 	.	''
I	think	 th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	``	divine	power	of	the	ocean	''	in	a	 Polynesia 	 n 	 	language	.
And	then	there	was	 th 	 is 	 	:	 Mi 	 ster 	 	Splashy	 P 	 ants 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	special	.	 Mi 	 ster 	 	 P 	 ants 	 	,	or	Splashy	,	to	his	 friend 	 s 	 	,	was	 ver 	 y 	 	popular	on	the	Internet	.
In	fact	,	 some 	 one 	 	on	Reddit	thought	,	``	Oh	,	what	a	great	thing	,	we	should	all	vote	 th 	 is 	 	up	.	''
And	,	you	know	,	 Reddit 	 ors 	 	 respond 	 ed 	 	and	all	 agree 	 d 	 	.
So	,	the	 vot 	 ing 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	and	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	got	 be 	 hind 	 	it	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
We	 change 	 d 	 	our	logo	,	for	the	day	,	from	the	alien	to	a	Splashy	,	to	sort	of	help	the	cause	.
And	it	was	n't	long	before	other	 s 	 ites 	 	like	 Far 	 k 	 	and	 Bo 	 ing 	 	 Bo 	 ing 	 	and	the	rest	of	the	Internet	 start 	 ed 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	Yes	!	We	love	Splashy	 P 	 ants 	 	.	''
So	,	it	went	from	about	five	percent	,	which	was	when	 th 	 is 	 	meme	 start 	 ed 	 	,	to	70	percent	at	the	end	of	 vot 	 ing 	 	.
 Whi 	 ch 	 	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	 impress 	 ive 	 	right	?	We	won	!	 Mi 	 ster 	 	Splashy	 P 	 ants 	 	was	 chose 	 n 	 	.	 H 	 mm 	 	,	just	 kid 	 d 	 ing 	 	.	 Oka 	 y 	 	.
So	,	 Green 	 peace 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	was	n't	that	crazy	about	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 want 	 ed 	 	one	of	 the 	 ir 	 	more	 thought 	 ful 	 	 name 	 s 	 	to	win	.
So	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	No	,	no	,	just	 kid 	 d 	 ing 	 	.	We	'll	give	it	 an 	 other 	 	week	of	 vot 	 ing 	 	.	''
Well	,	that	got	us	a	little	 ang 	 ry 	 	.
So	,	we	 change 	 d 	 	it	to	 Fight 	 in 	 	'	Splashy	.
And	the	Reddit	community	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	and	the	rest	of	the	 inter 	 net 	 	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	got	 be 	 hind 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
Facebook	 group 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 create 	 d 	 	.	Facebook	 application 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 create 	 d 	 	.
The	idea	was	,	``	Vote	your	 con 	 science 	 	,	''	vote	for	 Mi 	 ster 	 	Splashy	 P 	 ants 	 	.
And	people	 we 	 re 	 	 put 	 ting 	 	up	 sign 	 s 	 	in	the	real	world	--	--	about	 th 	 is 	 	whale	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	final	vote	.	When	all	was	 clear 	 ed 	 	...
78	percent	of	the	 vote 	 s 	 	,	and	to	give	you	an	idea	of	the	 land 	 slide 	 	,	the	next	highest	name	 pull 	 ed 	 	in	three	.	 Oka 	 y 	 	?
So	,	there	was	a	clear	 less 	 on 	 	here	.
And	that	was	that	the	Internet	 love 	 s 	 	 Mi 	 ster 	 	Splashy	 P 	 ants 	 	.
 Whi 	 ch 	 	is	obvious	.	It	's	a	great	name	.
 Every 	 one 	 	 want 	 s 	 	to	hear	 the 	 ir 	 	news	anchor	say	,	``	 Mi 	 ster 	 	Splashy	 P 	 ants 	 	.	''
And	I	think	that	's	what	 help 	 ed 	 	drive	 th 	 is 	 	.
But	what	was	cool	was	that	the	 re 	 percuss 	 ions 	 	now	for	 Green 	 peace 	 	was	,	they	 create 	 d 	 	an	entire	 market 	 ing 	 	campaign	around	it	.
 The 	 y 	 	sell	 Mi 	 ster 	 	Splashy	 P 	 ants 	 	 shirt 	 s 	 	and	 pin 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	even	 create 	 d 	 	an	 e 	 - 	 card 	 	so	you	could	 s 	 end 	 	your	friend	a	 danc 	 ing 	 	Splashy	.
But	what	was	even	more	 import 	 ant 	 	was	the	fact	that	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	 accomplish 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	mission	.	The	 Japan 	 ese 	 	government	 call 	 ed 	 	off	 the 	 ir 	 	 whal 	 ing 	 	 exp 	 ed 	 ition 	 	.	 Miss 	 ion 	 	 accomplish 	 ed 	 	.
 Green 	 peace 	 	was	 thrill 	 ed 	 	.	The	 whale 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	happy	.	That	's	a	quote	.
And	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 Reddit 	 ors 	 	in	the	Internet	community	 we 	 re 	 	happy	to	 particip 	 ate 	 	,	but	they	 we 	 re 	 	n't	whale	 lover 	 s 	 	.
A	few	of	them	 certain 	 ly 	 	 we 	 re 	 	.	But	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	a	lot	of	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	just	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	and	 re 	 ally 	 	caught	up	in	 th 	 is 	 	great	meme	,	and	in	fact	 some 	 one 	 	from	 Green 	 peace 	 	came	back	on	the	 s 	 ite 	 	and	 thank 	 ed 	 	Reddit	for	 it 	 s 	 	 particip 	 ation 	 	.
But	 th 	 is 	 	was	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	out	of	 al 	 truism 	 	.	 Th 	 is 	 	was	just	out	of	interest	in	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	cool	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	kind	of	how	the	Internet	 work 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	that	great	big	secret	.	 Be 	 cause 	 	the	Internet	 provide 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	level	 play 	 ing 	 	field	.
Your	link	is	just	 a 	 s 	 	good	 a 	 s 	 	your	link	,	which	is	just	 a 	 s 	 	good	 a 	 s 	 	my	link	.	 A 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	we	have	a	 brow 	 s 	 er 	 	,	 any 	 one 	 	can	get	to	any	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	no	matter	how	big	a	budget	you	have	.
That	is	,	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	keep	net	 neutral 	 ity 	 	in	place	.
The	other	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	is	that	it	 cost 	 s 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	get	that	content	 on 	 line 	 	now	.
There	are	so	 man 	 y 	 	great	 publish 	 ing 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	that	are	 avail 	 able 	 	,	it	 on 	 ly 	 	 take 	 s 	 	a	few	 minute 	 s 	 	of	your	time	now	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	produce	 some 	 thing 	 	.
And	the	cost	of	iteration	is	so	cheap	that	you	might	 a 	 s 	 	well	give	it	a	go	.
And	if	you	do	,	be	genuine	about	it	.	Be	honest	.	Be	up	front	.
And	one	of	the	great	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	that	 Green 	 peace 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 learn 	 ed 	 	was	that	it	's	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	to	lose	control	.
It	's	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	to	take	 your 	 self 	 	a	little	less	 serious 	 ly 	 	,	 give 	 n 	 	that	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	serious	cause	,	you	could	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	 achiev 	 e 	 	your	final	goal	.
And	that	's	the	final	 mess 	 age 	 	that	I	want	to	share	with	all	of	you	--	that	you	can	do	well	 on 	 line 	 	.
But	no	 long 	 er 	 	is	the	 mess 	 age 	 	going	to	be	coming	from	just	the	top	down	.
If	you	want	to	succeed	you	've	got	to	be	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	to	just	lose	control	.
Thank	you	.

 I 	 an 	 	 Rit 	 chie 	 	:	The	day	I	 turn 	 ed 	 	down	Tim	 Bern 	 ers 	 - 	 Lee 	 
Well	we	all	know	the	World	Wide	Web	 ha 	 s 	 	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 transform 	 ed 	 	 publish 	 ing 	 	,	 broad 	 cast 	 ing 	 	,	commerce	and	social	 connect 	 ivity 	 	,	but	where	did	it	all	come	from	?
And	I	'll	quote	three	people	:	 Van 	 ne 	 var 	 	Bush	,	 Do 	 ug 	 	 Eng 	 elbart 	 	and	Tim	 Bern 	 ers 	 - 	 Lee 	 	.
So	let	's	just	run	through	these	 guy 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 Van 	 ne 	 var 	 	Bush	.
 Van 	 ne 	 var 	 	Bush	was	the	U.S.	government	's	chief	scientific	 advise 	 r 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	war	.
And	in	1945	,	he	 publish 	 ed 	 	an	article	in	a	magazine	 call 	 ed 	 	Atlantic	 Mon 	 th 	 ly 	 	.
And	the	article	was	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 A 	 s 	 	We	May	Think	.	''
And	what	 Van 	 ne 	 var 	 	Bush	was	 say 	 ing 	 	was	the	way	we	use	information	is	broken	.
We	do	n't	work	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 lib 	 r 	 aries 	 	and	catalog	 system 	 s 	 	and	so	forth	.
The	brain	 work 	 s 	 	by	 associ 	 ation 	 	.
With	one	item	in	 it 	 s 	 	thought	,	it	 snap 	 s 	 	 instant 	 ly 	 	to	the	next	item	.
And	the	way	information	is	 structure 	 d 	 	is	 total 	 ly 	 	 in 	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 keep 	 ing 	 	up	with	 th 	 is 	 	process	.
And	so	he	 suggest 	 ed 	 	a	machine	,	and	he	 call 	 ed 	 	it	the	 meme 	 x 	 	.
And	the	 meme 	 x 	 	would	link	information	,	one	piece	of	information	to	a	related	piece	of	information	and	so	forth	.
 N 	 ow 	 	 th 	 is 	 	was	in	1945	.
A	computer	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 day 	 s 	 	was	 some 	 thing 	 	the	secret	 service 	 s 	 	used	to	use	for	code	 break 	 ing 	 	.
And	 no 	 body 	 	 k 	 new 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	about	it	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	was	before	the	computer	was	 invent 	 ed 	 	.
And	he	 pro 	 posed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	machine	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 meme 	 x 	 	.
And	he	had	a	platform	where	you	linked	information	to	other	information	,	and	then	you	could	call	it	up	at	will	.
So	 s 	 pinning 	 	forward	,	one	of	the	 guy 	 s 	 	who	read	 th 	 is 	 	article	was	a	guy	 call 	 ed 	 	 Do 	 ug 	 	 Eng 	 elbart 	 	,	and	he	was	a	U.S.	Air	Force	officer	.
And	he	was	 read 	 ing 	 	it	in	 the 	 ir 	 	library	in	the	Far	East	.
And	he	was	so	inspired	by	 th 	 is 	 	article	,	it	kind	of	 direct 	 ed 	 	the	rest	of	his	life	.
And	by	the	 mid 	 - 	 60 	 s 	 	,	he	was	able	to	put	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 to 	 	action	when	he	 work 	 ed 	 	at	the	 Stan 	 ford 	 	 Re 	 search 	 	Lab	in	California	.
He	built	a	system	.
The	system	was	designed	to	augment	human	 intellig 	 ence 	 	,	it	was	 call 	 ed 	 	.
And	in	a	premonition	of	 to 	 day 	 	's	world	of	cloud	computing	and	 soft 	 ware 	 s 	 	of	service	,	his	system	was	 call 	 ed 	 	NLS	for	 o 	 N 	 - 	 Lin 	 e 	 	System	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	 Do 	 ug 	 	 Eng 	 elbart 	 	.
He	was	giving	a	 present 	 ation 	 	at	the	Fall	 J 	 oint 	 	 Compu 	 ter 	 	 Con 	 ference 	 	in	1968	.
What	he	 show 	 ed 	 	--	he	 s 	 at 	 	on	a	stage	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	he	 demonst 	 rated 	 	 th 	 is 	 	system	.
He	had	his	head	mic	like	I	've	got	.
And	he	 work 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	system	.
And	you	can	see	,	he	's	 work 	 ing 	 	between	 document 	 s 	 	and	 graphic 	 s 	 	and	so	forth	.
And	he	's	 driv 	 ing 	 	it	all	with	 th 	 is 	 	platform	here	,	with	a	 five 	 - 	 finger 	 	 key 	 board 	 	and	the	world	's	first	computer	mouse	,	which	he	 special 	 ly 	 	designed	in	order	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	system	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	the	mouse	came	from	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	is	 Do 	 ug 	 	 Eng 	 elbart 	 	.
The	trouble	with	 Do 	 ug 	 	 Eng 	 elbart 	 	's	system	was	that	the	 computer 	 s 	 	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 day 	 s 	 	cost	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	million	 pound 	 s 	 	.
So	for	a	personal	computer	,	a	few	million	 pound 	 s 	 	was	like	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	personal	jet	plane	;	it	was	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	practical	.
But	spin	on	to	the	80s	when	personal	 computer 	 s 	 	did	 arriv 	 e 	 	,	then	there	was	room	for	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	system	on	personal	 computer 	 s 	 	.
And	my	company	,	 O 	 W 	 L 	 	built	a	system	 call 	 ed 	 	 Gui 	 de 	 	for	the	Apple	Macintosh	.
And	we	 deliver 	 ed 	 	the	world	's	first	 hyper 	 text 	 	system	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	to	get	a	head	of	 s 	 team 	 	.
Apple	 introduc 	 ed 	 	a	thing	 call 	 ed 	 	 Hyper 	 Card 	 	,	and	they	made	a	bit	of	a	 fu 	 s 	 s 	 	about	it	.
 The 	 y 	 	had	a	12-page	supplement	in	the	Wall	Street	Journal	the	day	it	 launch 	 ed 	 	.
The	 magazine 	 s 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	to	cover	it	.
 By 	 te 	 	magazine	and	 Communic 	 ations 	 	at	the	 AC 	 M 	 	had	special	 issue 	 s 	 	 cover 	 ing 	 	 hyper 	 text 	 	.
We	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	PC	version	of	 th 	 is 	 	product	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	the	Macintosh	version	.
And	our	PC	version	 be 	 came 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	mature	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	some	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	system	in	action	in	the	late	80s	.
You	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	deliver	 document 	 s 	 	,	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	do	it	over	 network 	 s 	 	.
We	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	system	 s 	 uch 	 	that	it	had	a	 mark 	 up 	 	language	based	on	html	.
We	 call 	 ed 	 	it	hml	:	 hyper 	 text 	 	 mark 	 up 	 	language	.
And	the	system	was	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 do 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	large	 document 	 ation 	 	 system 	 s 	 	over	computer	 network 	 s 	 	.
So	I	took	 th 	 is 	 	system	to	a	trade	show	in	 Ver 	 sail 	 les 	 	near	Paris	in	late	 Nove 	 mb 	 er 	 	1990	.
And	I	was	 approach 	 ed 	 	by	a	nice	young	man	 call 	 ed 	 	Tim	 Bern 	 ers 	 - 	 Lee 	 	who	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 A 	 re 	 	you	 I 	 an 	 	 Rit 	 chie 	 	?	''	and	I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Yeah	.	''
And	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	I	need	to	talk	to	you	.	''
And	he	told	me	about	his	 pro 	 posed 	 	system	 call 	 ed 	 	the	World	Wide	Web	.
And	I	thought	,	well	,	that	's	got	a	 pre 	 tent 	 ious 	 	name	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	since	the	whole	system	ran	on	his	computer	in	his	 off 	 ice 	 	.
But	he	was	 complete 	 ly 	 	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	that	his	World	Wide	Web	would	take	over	the	world	one	day	.
And	he	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	 persuad 	 e 	 	me	to	write	the	 brow 	 s 	 er 	 	for	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	his	system	did	n't	have	any	 graphic 	 s 	 	or	 font 	 s 	 	or	 lay 	 out 	 	or	 any 	 thing 	 	;	it	was	just	plain	text	.
I	thought	,	well	,	you	know	,	 interest 	 ing 	 	,	but	a	guy	from	CERN	,	he	's	not	going	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
So	we	did	n't	do	it	.
In	the	next	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	the	 hyper 	 text 	 	community	did	n't	 recogn 	 ize 	 	him	either	.
In	1992	,	his	paper	was	 reject 	 ed 	 	for	the	 Hyper 	 text 	 	 Con 	 ference 	 	.
In	1993	,	there	was	a	table	at	the	 con 	 ference 	 	in	 Sea 	 ttle 	 	,	and	a	guy	 call 	 ed 	 	Marc	 Andre 	 es 	 s 	 en 	 	was	 demonst 	 rating 	 	his	little	 brow 	 s 	 er 	 	for	the	World	Wide	Web	.
And	I	saw	it	,	and	I	thought	,	 y 	 ep 	 	,	that	's	it	.
And	the	 ver 	 y 	 	next	year	,	in	1994	,	we	had	the	 con 	 ference 	 	here	in	 Edi 	 nburgh 	 	,	and	I	had	no	 op 	 position 	 	in	 hav 	 ing 	 	Tim	 Bern 	 ers 	 - 	 Lee 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 key 	 note 	 	speaker	.
So	that	 put 	 s 	 	me	in	 pre 	 tty 	 	 illustr 	 ious 	 	company	.
There	was	a	guy	 call 	 ed 	 	Dick	 Row 	 e 	 	who	was	at	 De 	 c 	 ca 	 	 Record 	 s 	 	and	 turn 	 ed 	 	down	The	 Beatle 	 s 	 	.
There	was	a	guy	 call 	 ed 	 	 G 	 ary 	 	 Kil 	 d 	 all 	 	who	went	 fly 	 ing 	 	his	plane	when	IBM	came	looking	for	an	 oper 	 ating 	 	system	for	the	IBM	PC	,	and	he	was	n't	there	,	so	they	went	back	to	see	Bill	 Gate 	 s 	 	.
And	the	12	 publish 	 ers 	 	who	 turn 	 ed 	 	down	 J. 	 K. 	 	 Row 	 ling 	 	's	 Har 	 ry 	 	 Pot 	 ter 	 	,	I	guess	.
On	the	other	hand	,	there	's	Marc	 Andre 	 es 	 s 	 en 	 	who	wrote	the	world	's	first	 brow 	 s 	 er 	 	for	the	World	Wide	Web	.
And	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	 For 	 tune 	 	magazine	,	he	's	worth	700	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
But	is	he	happy	?

 Mar 	 co 	 	 Tem 	 pest 	 	:	A	 cyber 	 - 	 magic 	 	card	trick	like	no	other
Good	 morn 	 ing 	 	.	So	magic	is	an	 excel 	 lent 	 	way	for	 stay 	 ing 	 	 a 	 head 	 	of	the	 re 	 ality 	 	 curv 	 e 	 	,	to	make	possible	 to 	 day 	 	what	science	will	make	a	 re 	 ality 	 	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	.
 A 	 s 	 	a	 cyber 	 - 	 magic 	 ian 	 	,	I	combine	 element 	 s 	 	of	illusion	and	science	to	give	us	a	feel	of	how	future	 techno 	 logies 	 	might	be	 experience 	 d 	 	.
You	've	 prob 	 ably 	 	all	heard	of	Google	's	Project	Glass	.
It	's	new	technology	.	You	look	through	them	and	the	world	you	see	is	 augment 	 ed 	 	with	data	:	 name 	 s 	 	of	 place 	 s 	 	,	 monument 	 s 	 	,	 building 	 s 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	one	day	even	the	 name 	 s 	 	of	the	 strange 	 rs 	 	that	pass	you	on	the	street	.
So	these	are	my	illusion	 glass 	 es 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	a	little	 big 	 ger 	 	.	 The 	 y 	 	're	a	prototype	.
And	when	you	look	through	them	,	you	get	a	 glimps 	 e 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	mind	of	the	 cyber 	 - 	 illusion 	 ist 	 	.
Let	me	show	you	what	I	mean	.
All	we	need	is	a	 play 	 ing 	 	card	.	Any	card	will	do	.
Like	 th 	 is 	 	.	And	let	me	mark	it	so	we	can	 recogn 	 ize 	 	it	when	we	see	it	 aga 	 in 	 	.
All	right	.	 Ver 	 y 	 	significant	mark	.
And	let	's	put	it	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	deck	,	 some 	 where 	 	in	the	middle	,	and	let	's	get	 start 	 ed 	 	.
Voice	:	System	ready	.	 Acquir 	 ing 	 	image	.
 Mar 	 co 	 	 Tem 	 pest 	 	:	For	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	do	n't	play	 card 	 s 	 	,	a	deck	of	 card 	 s 	 	is	made	up	of	four	different	 suit 	 s 	 	:	 heart 	 s 	 	,	 club 	 s 	 	,	 diamond 	 s 	 	and	 s 	 pad 	 es 	 	.
The	 card 	 s 	 	are	 among 	 st 	 	the	 old 	 est 	 	of	 symbol 	 s 	 	,	and	have	 be 	 en 	 	 interpret 	 ed 	 	in	 man 	 y 	 	different	ways	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	some	say	that	the	four	 suit 	 s 	 	represent	the	four	 season 	 s 	 	.
There	's	spring	,	summer	,	 aut 	 umn 	 	and	â	Voice	:	My	 favor 	 ite 	 	season	is	winter	.	MT	:	Well	 yea 	 h 	 	,	mine	too	.
 W 	 inter 	 	is	like	magic	.	It	's	a	time	of	change	,	when	 warm 	 th 	 	 turn 	 s 	 	to	cold	,	water	 turn 	 s 	 	to	snow	,	and	then	it	all	 disappear 	 s 	 	.
There	are	13	 card 	 s 	 	in	each	suit	.
Voice	:	 E 	 ach 	 	card	 represent 	 s 	 	a	phase	of	the	13	 lun 	 ar 	 	 cycle 	 s 	 	.
MT	:	So	over	here	is	low	tide	,	and	over	here	is	high	tide	,	and	in	the	middle	is	the	moon	.
Voice	:	The	moon	is	one	of	the	most	potent	 symbol 	 s 	 	of	magic	.
MT	:	There	are	two	 color 	 s 	 	in	a	deck	of	 card 	 s 	 	.
There	is	the	color	red	and	the	color	black	,	 represent 	 ing 	 	the	constant	change	from	day	to	night	.
Voice	:	 Mar 	 co 	 	,	I	did	not	know	you	could	do	that	.
MT	:	And	is	it	a	 co 	 incidence 	 	that	there	are	52	 card 	 s 	 	in	a	deck	of	 card 	 s 	 	,	just	 a 	 s 	 	there	are	52	 week 	 s 	 	in	a	year	?
Voice	:	If	you	total	all	the	 spot 	 s 	 	on	a	deck	of	 card 	 s 	 	,	the	result	is	365	.
MT	:	Oh	,	365	,	the	number	of	 day 	 s 	 	in	a	year	,	the	number	of	 day 	 s 	 	between	each	 birth 	 day 	 	.
Make	a	wish	.
Voice	:	Do	n't	tell	,	or	it	wo	n't	come	true	.
MT	:	Well	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	matter	of	fact	,	it	was	on	my	sixth	 birth 	 day 	 	that	I	 receiv 	 ed 	 	my	first	deck	of	 card 	 s 	 	,	and	ever	since	that	day	,	I	have	 travel 	 ed 	 	around	the	world	 perform 	 ing 	 	magic	for	 boy 	 s 	 	and	 girl 	 s 	 	,	men	and	women	,	 husband 	 s 	 	and	wives	,	even	 king 	 s 	 	and	 que 	 en 	 s 	 	.
Voice	:	And	who	are	these	?	MT	:	Ah	,	 mis 	 chief 	 - 	 makers 	 	.	 Wat 	 ch 	 	.
 Wa 	 ke 	 	up	.
 Jok 	 er 	 	:	 Who 	 a 	 	.	MT	:	 A 	 re 	 	you	ready	for	your	party	piece	?
 Jok 	 er 	 	:	 Read 	 y 	 	!	MT	:	Let	me	see	what	you	've	got	.
 Jok 	 er 	 	:	 Present 	 ing 	 	my	 po 	 go 	 	stick	.	MT	:	Ah	.	 Wat 	 ch 	 	out	.
 Jok 	 er 	 	:	 Who 	 a 	 	,	 who 	 a 	 	,	 who 	 a 	 	,	oh	!
MT	:	But	 to 	 day 	 	,	I	am	 perform 	 ing 	 	for	a	different	kind	of	audience	.
I	'm	 perform 	 ing 	 	for	you	.
Voice	:	 Sign 	 ed 	 	card	 detect 	 ed 	 	.	MT	:	Well	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	people	ask	me	how	do	you	 be 	 come 	 	a	 magic 	 ian 	 	?	 I 	 s 	 	it	a	9-to-5	job	?
Of	course	not	!	You	've	got	to	practice	24/7	.
I	do	n't	 liter 	 ally 	 	mean	24	 hour 	 s 	 	,	seven	 day 	 s 	 	a	week	.
24/7	is	a	little	bit	of	an	 exagge 	 ration 	 	,	but	it	 do 	 es 	 	take	practice	.	 N 	 ow 	 	,	some	people	will	say	,	well	,	magic	,	that	must	be	the	work	of	some	 e 	 vil 	 	 super 	 natural 	 	force	.
 Who 	 a 	 	.
Well	,	to	 th 	 is 	 	,	I	just	say	,	no	no	.
 Actu 	 ally 	 	,	in	German	,	it	's	 ne 	 in 	 	 ne 	 in 	 	.
 Mag 	 ic 	 	is	n't	that	 intens 	 e 	 	.	I	have	to	 war 	 n 	 	you	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	if	you	ever	play	with	 some 	 one 	 	who	 deal 	 s 	 	 card 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	do	n't	play	for	money	.
Voice	:	Why	not	?	That	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	hand	.
The	 odd 	 s 	 	of	 get 	 ting 	 	it	are	4,165	to	one	.
MT	:	Yeah	,	but	I	guess	my	hand	is	better	.	We	beat	the	 odd 	 s 	 	.
Voice	:	I	think	you	got	your	 birth 	 day 	 	wish	.	MT	:	And	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 leav 	 es 	 	me	with	the	last	,	and	most	 import 	 ant 	 	card	of	all	:	the	one	with	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	significant	mark	on	it	.

 Mart 	 in 	 	 Jac 	 que 	 s 	 	:	 Under 	 stand 	 ing 	 	the	rise	of	China
The	world	is	changing	with	 re 	 ally 	 	 remark 	 able 	 	speed	.
If	you	look	at	the	chart	at	the	top	here	,	you	'll	see	that	in	2025	,	these	 Gold 	 man 	 	 S 	 ach 	 s 	 	 project 	 ions 	 	suggest	that	the	 Chi 	 nese 	 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	will	be	 al 	 most 	 	the	same	 s 	 ize 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	American	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
And	if	you	look	at	the	chart	for	2050	,	it	's	 project 	 ed 	 	that	the	 Chi 	 nese 	 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	will	be	twice	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	the	American	 eco 	 nomy 	 	,	and	the	Indian	 eco 	 nomy 	 	will	be	 al 	 most 	 	the	same	 s 	 ize 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	American	 eco 	 nomy 	 	.
And	we	should	bear	in	mind	here	that	these	 project 	 ions 	 	 we 	 re 	 	drawn	up	before	the	Western	financial	crisis	.
A	couple	of	 week 	 s 	 	ago	,	I	was	looking	at	the	 lat 	 est 	 	 project 	 ion 	 	by	BNP	 Par 	 i 	 bas 	 	for	when	China	will	have	a	 large 	 r 	 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	than	the	 Unit 	 ed 	 	 Stat 	 es 	 	.
 Gold 	 man 	 	 S 	 ach 	 s 	 	 project 	 ed 	 	2027	.
The	 post 	 - 	 crisis 	 	 project 	 ion 	 	is	2020	.
That	's	just	a	decade	away	.
China	is	going	to	change	the	world	in	two	fundamental	 respect 	 s 	 	.
First	of	all	,	it	's	a	huge	 develop 	 ing 	 	country	with	a	population	of	1.3	billion	people	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	growing	for	over	30	 year 	 s 	 	at	around	10	percent	a	year	.
And	 with 	 in 	 	a	decade	,	it	will	have	the	largest	 eco 	 nomy 	 	in	the	world	.
Never	before	in	the	modern	era	 ha 	 s 	 	the	largest	 eco 	 nomy 	 	in	the	world	 be 	 en 	 	that	of	a	 develop 	 ing 	 	country	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	a	 develop 	 ed 	 	country	.
 Second 	 ly 	 	,	for	the	first	time	in	the	modern	era	,	the	 domin 	 ant 	 	country	in	the	world	--	which	I	think	is	what	China	will	 be 	 come 	 	--	will	be	not	from	the	West	and	from	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	different	 civil 	 ization 	 al 	 	 root 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	I	know	it	's	a	 wide 	 spread 	 	assumption	in	the	West	that	 a 	 s 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	 modern 	 ize 	 	,	they	 al 	 so 	 	 western 	 ize 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	an	illusion	.
It	's	an	assumption	that	 modern 	 ity 	 	is	a	product	 simpl 	 y 	 	of	 com 	 petition 	 	,	 market 	 s 	 	and	technology	.
It	is	not	.	It	is	 al 	 so 	 	shaped	 equal 	 ly 	 	by	 histo 	 ry 	 	and	culture	.
China	is	not	like	the	West	,	and	it	will	not	 be 	 come 	 	like	the	West	.
It	will	remain	in	 ver 	 y 	 	fundamental	 respect 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	different	.
 N 	 ow 	 	the	big	question	here	is	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	how	do	we	make	sense	of	China	?
How	do	we	try	to	understand	what	China	is	?
And	the	problem	we	have	in	the	West	at	the	moment	,	by	and	large	,	is	that	the	 convention 	 al 	 	approach	is	that	we	understand	it	 re 	 ally 	 	in	Western	 term 	 s 	 	,	using	Western	 idea 	 s 	 	.
We	ca	n't	.
 N 	 ow 	 	I	want	to	 off 	 er 	 	you	three	building	 block 	 s 	 	for	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	what	China	is	like	,	just	 a 	 s 	 	a	 begin 	 ning 	 	.
The	first	is	 th 	 is 	 	:	that	China	is	not	 re 	 ally 	 	a	 nation 	 - 	 state 	 	.
 Oka 	 y 	 	,	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	 it 	 self 	 	a	 nation 	 - 	 state 	 	for	the	last	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	,	but	 every 	 one 	 	who	 know 	 s 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	about	China	 know 	 s 	 	it	's	a	lot	 old 	 er 	 	than	 th 	 is 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	was	what	China	 look 	 ed 	 	like	with	the	 vict 	 ory 	 	of	the	 Q 	 in 	 	 Dy 	 nasty 	 	in	221	 B. 	 C 	 	.	at	the	end	of	the	 war 	 ring 	 - 	 state 	 	period	--	the	birth	of	modern	China	.
And	you	can	see	it	against	the	 bound 	 aries 	 	of	modern	China	.
Or	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	 after 	 ward 	 	,	the	Han	 Dy 	 nasty 	 	,	still	2,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
And	you	can	see	 al 	 ready 	 	it	 occu 	 pies 	 	most	of	what	we	now	know	 a 	 s 	 	 East 	 ern 	 	China	,	which	is	where	the	vast	 major 	 ity 	 	of	 Chi 	 nese 	 	lived	then	and	live	now	.
 N 	 ow 	 	what	is	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	what	 give 	 s 	 	China	 it 	 s 	 	sense	of	 be 	 ing 	 	China	,	what	 give 	 s 	 	the	 Chi 	 nese 	 	the	sense	of	what	it	is	to	be	 Chi 	 nese 	 	,	 come 	 s 	 	not	from	the	last	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	,	not	from	the	 nation 	 - 	 state 	 	period	,	which	is	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	West	,	but	from	the	period	,	if	you	like	,	of	the	 civil 	 ization 	 - 	 state 	 	.
I	'm	 think 	 ing 	 	here	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	of	 custom 	 s 	 	like	 ance 	 stral 	 	worship	,	of	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 distinct 	 ive 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	of	the	state	,	 like 	 wise 	 	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 distinct 	 ive 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	of	the	family	,	social	 relationship 	 s 	 	like	guanxi	,	 Con 	 fuc 	 ian 	 	 value 	 s 	 	and	so	on	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	all	 thing 	 s 	 	that	come	from	the	period	of	the	 civil 	 ization 	 - 	 state 	 	.
In	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	China	,	 un 	 like 	 	the	Western	 state 	 s 	 	and	most	 count 	 ries 	 	in	the	world	,	is	shaped	by	 it 	 s 	 	sense	of	 civil 	 ization 	 	,	 it 	 s 	 	 exist 	 ence 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 civil 	 ization 	 - 	 state 	 	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 a 	 s 	 	a	 nation 	 - 	 state 	 	.
And	there	's	one	other	thing	to	add	to	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	that	is	 th 	 is 	 	:	Of	course	we	know	China	's	big	,	huge	,	 demo 	 graphical 	 ly 	 	and	 geo 	 graphical 	 ly 	 	,	with	a	population	of	1.3	billion	people	.
What	we	often	are	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	aware	of	is	the	fact	that	China	is	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 divers 	 e 	 	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 plural 	 istic 	 	,	and	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	 ver 	 y 	 	 de 	 central 	 ized 	 	.
You	ca	n't	run	a	place	on	 th 	 is 	 	scale	 simpl 	 y 	 	from	 Beij 	 ing 	 	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	we	think	 th 	 is 	 	to	be	the	case	.
It	's	never	 be 	 en 	 	the	case	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	is	China	,	a	 civil 	 ization 	 - 	 state 	 	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	a	 nation 	 - 	 state 	 	.
And	what	 do 	 es 	 	it	mean	?
Well	,	I	think	it	 ha 	 s 	 	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 pro 	 found 	 	 implic 	 ations 	 	.
I	'll	give	you	two	quick	 one 	 s 	 	.
The	first	is	that	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 politic 	 al 	 	value	for	the	 Chi 	 nese 	 	is	 un 	 ity 	 	,	is	the	maintenance	of	 Chi 	 nese 	 	 civil 	 ization 	 	.
You	know	,	2,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 Euro 	 pe 	 	:	 break 	 down 	 	--	the	 fragment 	 ation 	 	of	the	 Ho 	 ly 	 	 Ro 	 man 	 	Empire	.
It	 divid 	 ed 	 	,	and	it	's	 remain 	 ed 	 	 divid 	 ed 	 	ever	since	.
China	,	over	the	same	time	period	,	went	in	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	direction	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 pain 	 fully 	 	 hold 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	huge	 civil 	 ization 	 	,	 civil 	 ization 	 - 	 state 	 	,	together	.
The	second	is	 may 	 be 	 	more	prosaic	,	which	is	 H 	 ong 	 	 K 	 ong 	 	.
Do	you	remember	the	 hand 	 over 	 	of	 H 	 ong 	 	 K 	 ong 	 	by	 Brit 	 ain 	 	to	China	in	1997	?
You	may	remember	what	the	 Chi 	 nese 	 	 constit 	 ution 	 al 	 	 pro 	 position 	 	was	.
One	country	,	two	 system 	 s 	 	.
And	I	'll	lay	a	 wage 	 r 	 	that	 bare 	 ly 	 	 any 	 one 	 	in	the	West	 believ 	 ed 	 	them	.
``	 Wind 	 ow 	 	 dress 	 ing 	 	.
When	China	 get 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	on	 H 	 ong 	 	 K 	 ong 	 	,	that	wo	n't	be	the	case	.	''
 Thir 	 teen 	 	 year 	 s 	 	on	,	the	 politic 	 al 	 	and	legal	system	in	 H 	 ong 	 	 K 	 ong 	 	is	 a 	 s 	 	different	now	 a 	 s 	 	it	was	in	1997	.
We	 we 	 re 	 	wrong	.	Why	 we 	 re 	 	we	wrong	?
We	 we 	 re 	 	wrong	 be 	 cause 	 	we	thought	,	 natural 	 ly 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	in	 nation 	 - 	 state 	 	ways	.
Think	of	German	 un 	 ification 	 	,	1990	.
What	 happen 	 ed 	 	?
Well	,	 bas 	 ically 	 	the	East	was	 swallow 	 ed 	 	by	the	West	.
One	nation	,	one	system	.
That	is	the	 nation 	 - 	 state 	 	 ment 	 ality 	 	.
But	you	ca	n't	run	a	country	like	China	,	a	 civil 	 ization 	 - 	 state 	 	,	on	the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	one	 civil 	 ization 	 	,	one	system	.
It	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	.
So	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	 respons 	 e 	 	of	China	to	the	question	of	 H 	 ong 	 	 K 	 ong 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	it	will	be	to	the	question	of	 Tai 	 wan 	 	--	was	a	natural	 respons 	 e 	 	:	one	 civil 	 ization 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 system 	 s 	 	.
Let	me	 off 	 er 	 	you	 an 	 other 	 	building	block	to	try	and	understand	China	--	 may 	 be 	 	not	sort	of	a	 comfort 	 able 	 	one	.
The	 Chi 	 nese 	 	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	different	conception	of	race	to	most	other	 count 	 ries 	 	.
Do	you	know	,	of	the	1.3	billion	 Chi 	 nese 	 	,	over	90	percent	of	them	think	they	belong	to	the	same	race	,	the	Han	?
 N 	 ow 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	from	the	world	's	[	other	]	most	 popu 	 lous 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	.
India	,	the	 Unit 	 ed 	 	 Stat 	 es 	 	,	Indonesia	,	Brazil	--	all	of	them	are	 multi 	 racial 	 	.
The	 Chi 	 nese 	 	do	n't	feel	like	that	.
China	is	 on 	 ly 	 	 multi 	 racial 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	at	the	 margin 	 s 	 	.
So	the	question	is	,	why	?
Well	the	reason	,	I	think	,	 essential 	 ly 	 	is	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	back	to	the	 civil 	 ization 	 - 	 state 	 	.
A	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	at	 l 	 east 	 	2,000	 year 	 s 	 	,	a	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 con 	 quest 	 	,	occupation	,	absorption	,	 a 	 s 	 simil 	 ation 	 	and	so	on	,	led	to	the	process	by	which	,	over	time	,	 th 	 is 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	of	the	Han	 emerge 	 d 	 	--	of	course	,	 nurture 	 d 	 	by	a	growing	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	sense	of	cultural	 ident 	 ity 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	the	great	advantage	of	 th 	 is 	 	 historic 	 al 	 	experience	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	that	,	 with 	 out 	 	the	Han	,	China	could	never	have	held	together	.
The	Han	 ident 	 ity 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	the	cement	which	 ha 	 s 	 	held	 th 	 is 	 	country	together	.
The	great	 dis 	 advantage 	 	of	it	is	that	the	Han	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	weak	conception	of	cultural	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 super 	 ior 	 ity 	 	,	and	they	are	 dis 	 respect 	 ful 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	who	are	not	.
 H 	 ence 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	attitude	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	to	the	Uyghurs	and	to	the	 Tibet 	 an 	 s 	 	.
Or	let	me	give	you	my	third	building	block	,	the	 Chi 	 nese 	 	state	.
 N 	 ow 	 	the	relationship	between	the	state	and	 socie 	 ty 	 	in	China	is	 ver 	 y 	 	different	from	that	in	the	West	.
 N 	 ow 	 	we	in	the	West	 overwhelm 	 ing 	 ly 	 	seem	to	think	--	in	these	 day 	 s 	 	at	 l 	 east 	 	--	that	the	 author 	 ity 	 	and	 leg 	 i 	 timacy 	 	of	the	state	is	a	function	of	 demo 	 cracy 	 	.
The	problem	with	 th 	 is 	 	 pro 	 position 	 	is	that	the	 Chi 	 nese 	 	state	 enjoy 	 s 	 	more	 leg 	 i 	 timacy 	 	and	more	 author 	 ity 	 	 among 	 st 	 	the	 Chi 	 nese 	 	than	is	true	with	any	Western	state	.
And	the	reason	for	 th 	 is 	 	is	 be 	 cause 	 	--	well	,	there	are	two	 reason 	 s 	 	,	I	think	.
And	it	's	 obvious 	 ly 	 	got	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	 demo 	 cracy 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	in	our	 term 	 s 	 	the	 Chi 	 nese 	 	 certain 	 ly 	 	do	n't	have	a	 demo 	 cracy 	 	.
And	the	reason	for	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	 first 	 ly 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	state	in	China	is	 give 	 n 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	special	--	it	 enjoy 	 s 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	special	 sign 	 ific 	 ance 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 represent 	 ative 	 	,	the	 embodi 	 ment 	 	and	the	 guard 	 ian 	 	of	 Chi 	 nese 	 	 civil 	 ization 	 	,	of	the	 civil 	 ization 	 - 	 state 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 a 	 s 	 	close	 a 	 s 	 	China	 get 	 s 	 	to	a	kind	of	spiritual	role	.
And	the	second	reason	is	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	in	 Euro 	 pe 	 	and	North	America	,	the	state	's	power	is	 continu 	 ously 	 	 challeng 	 ed 	 	--	I	mean	in	the	European	tradition	,	 historic 	 ally 	 	against	the	church	,	against	other	 sector 	 s 	 	of	the	 aristoc 	 racy 	 	,	against	 merchan 	 ts 	 	and	so	on	--	for	1,000	 year 	 s 	 	,	the	power	of	the	 Chi 	 nese 	 	state	 ha 	 s 	 	not	 be 	 en 	 	 challeng 	 ed 	 	.
It	's	had	no	serious	 rival 	 s 	 	.
So	you	can	see	that	the	way	in	which	power	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 construct 	 ed 	 	in	China	is	 ver 	 y 	 	different	from	our	experience	in	Western	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
The	result	,	by	the	way	,	is	that	the	 Chi 	 nese 	 	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	different	view	of	the	state	.
 Where 	 a 	 s 	 	we	tend	to	view	it	 a 	 s 	 	an	 intrud 	 er 	 	,	a	 strange 	 r 	 	,	 certain 	 ly 	 	an	organ	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	 power 	 s 	 	need	to	be	 limit 	 ed 	 	or	defined	and	 con 	 s 	 trained 	 	,	the	 Chi 	 nese 	 	do	n't	see	the	state	like	that	at	all	.
The	 Chi 	 nese 	 	view	the	state	 a 	 s 	 	an	 intima 	 te 	 	--	not	just	 a 	 s 	 	an	 intima 	 te 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	member	of	the	family	--	not	just	in	fact	 a 	 s 	 	a	member	of	the	family	,	but	 a 	 s 	 	the	head	of	the	family	,	the	patriarch	of	the	family	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	 Chi 	 nese 	 	view	of	the	state	--	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	different	to	 our 	 s 	 	.
It	's	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	in	 socie 	 ty 	 	in	a	different	kind	of	way	to	what	is	the	case	in	the	West	.
And	I	would	suggest	to	you	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	what	we	are	 deal 	 ing 	 	with	here	,	in	the	 Chi 	 nese 	 	 con 	 text 	 	,	is	a	new	kind	of	paradigm	,	which	is	different	from	 any 	 thing 	 	we	've	had	to	think	about	in	the	past	.
Know	that	China	 believ 	 es 	 	in	the	market	and	the	state	.
I	mean	,	Adam	Smith	,	 al 	 ready 	 	writing	in	the	late	18th	century	,	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	The	 Chi 	 nese 	 	market	is	 large 	 r 	 	and	more	 develop 	 ed 	 	and	more	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	than	 any 	 thing 	 	in	 Euro 	 pe 	 	.	''
And	,	 a 	 part 	 	from	the	 Ma 	 o 	 	period	,	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 remain 	 ed 	 	more	or	less	the	case	ever	since	.
But	 th 	 is 	 	is	 combine 	 d 	 	with	an	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	strong	and	 ubiqu 	 it 	 ous 	 	state	.
The	state	is	 every 	 where 	 	in	China	.
I	mean	,	it	's	 lead 	 ing 	 	 firm 	 s 	 	--	 man 	 y 	 	of	them	are	still	 public 	 ly 	 	owned	.
 Priv 	 ate 	 	 firm 	 s 	 	,	 how 	 ever 	 	large	they	are	,	like	 Len 	 ov 	 o 	 	,	depend	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	on	state	 patron 	 age 	 	.
 Target 	 s 	 	for	the	 eco 	 nomy 	 	and	so	on	are	set	by	the	state	.
And	the	state	,	of	course	,	 it 	 s 	 	 author 	 ity 	 	 flow 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	other	 area 	 s 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	we	are	familiar	with	--	with	 some 	 thing 	 	like	the	 one 	 - 	 child 	 	policy	.
 Mo 	 re 	 over 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	old	state	tradition	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	old	tradition	of	 state 	 craft 	 	.
I	mean	,	if	you	want	an	 illustr 	 ation 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	the	Great	Wall	is	one	.
But	 th 	 is 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	Grand	 Can 	 al 	 	,	which	was	 construct 	 ed 	 	in	the	first	 in 	 stance 	 	in	the	fifth	century	 B. 	 C 	 	.
and	was	 final 	 ly 	 	 complete 	 d 	 	in	the	 seven 	 th 	 	century	 A. 	 D 	 	.
It	went	for	1,114	 mile 	 s 	 	,	 link 	 ing 	 	 Beij 	 ing 	 	with	 Hang 	 zhou 	 	and	 Sha 	 n 	 ghai 	 	.
So	there	's	a	long	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	state	 infra 	 structural 	 	 project 	 s 	 	in	China	,	which	I	suppose	 help 	 s 	 	us	to	explain	what	we	see	 to 	 day 	 	,	which	is	 some 	 thing 	 	like	the	Three	 Gorge 	 s 	 	Dam	and	 man 	 y 	 	other	 express 	 ions 	 	of	state	 compete 	 nce 	 	 with 	 in 	 	China	.
So	there	we	have	three	building	 block 	 s 	 	for	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	that	is	China	--	the	 civil 	 ization 	 - 	 state 	 	,	the	 not 	 ion 	 	of	race	and	the	nature	of	the	state	and	 it 	 s 	 	relationship	to	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
And	yet	we	still	insist	,	by	and	large	,	in	 think 	 ing 	 	that	we	can	understand	China	by	 simpl 	 y 	 	 draw 	 ing 	 	on	Western	experience	,	looking	at	it	through	Western	 eye 	 s 	 	,	using	Western	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	.
If	you	want	to	know	why	we	 un 	 er 	 ring 	 ly 	 	seem	to	get	China	wrong	--	our	 predict 	 ions 	 	about	what	's	going	to	happen	to	China	are	 in 	 correct 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	reason	.
 Un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	I	think	,	I	have	to	say	that	I	think	attitude	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	China	is	that	of	a	kind	of	little	 Western 	 er 	 	 ment 	 ality 	 	.
It	's	kind	of	 arrog 	 ant 	 	.
It	's	 arrog 	 ant 	 	in	the	sense	that	we	think	that	we	are	best	,	and	 there 	 fore 	 	we	have	the	universal	measure	.
And	 second 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	 ignor 	 ant 	 	.
We	 re 	 fuse 	 	to	 re 	 ally 	 	address	the	issue	of	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
You	know	,	there	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 pass 	 age 	 	in	a	book	by	Paul	Cohen	,	the	American	historian	.
And	Paul	Cohen	 argu 	 es 	 	that	the	West	 think 	 s 	 	of	 it 	 self 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	most	 cosmo 	 politan 	 	of	all	 culture 	 s 	 	.
But	it	's	not	.
In	 man 	 y 	 	ways	,	it	's	the	most	parochial	,	 be 	 cause 	 	for	200	 year 	 s 	 	,	the	West	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	so	 domin 	 ant 	 	in	the	world	that	it	's	not	 re 	 ally 	 	 need 	 ed 	 	to	understand	other	 culture 	 s 	 	,	other	 civil 	 ization 	 s 	 	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	,	at	the	end	of	the	day	,	it	could	,	if	 necess 	 ary 	 	by	force	,	get	 it 	 s 	 	own	way	.
 Where 	 a 	 s 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 culture 	 s 	 	--	 virtual 	 ly 	 	the	rest	of	the	world	,	in	fact	,	which	have	 be 	 en 	 	in	a	far	 weak 	 er 	 	position	,	 vis 	 - 	 a 	 - 	 vis 	 	the	West	--	have	 be 	 en 	 	 there 	 by 	 	 force 	 d 	 	to	understand	the	West	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	West	's	presence	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 socie 	 ties 	 	.
And	 there 	 fore 	 	,	they	are	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	,	more	 cosmo 	 politan 	 	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	than	the	West	.
I	mean	,	take	the	question	of	East	Asia	.
East	Asia	:	Japan	,	Korea	,	China	,	etc	.	--	a	third	of	the	world	's	population	 live 	 s 	 	there	.
 N 	 ow 	 	the	largest	economic	region	in	the	world	.
And	I	'll	tell	you	now	,	that	East	 Asian 	 ers 	 	,	people	from	East	Asia	,	are	far	more	 knowledge 	 able 	 	about	the	West	than	the	West	is	about	East	Asia	.
 N 	 ow 	 	 th 	 is 	 	point	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 germ 	 ane 	 	,	I	'm	 af 	 raid 	 	,	to	the	present	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	?	Back	to	that	chart	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	the	 Gold 	 man 	 	 S 	 ach 	 s 	 	chart	.
What	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	is	that	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 rapid 	 ly 	 	in	 historic 	 al 	 	 term 	 s 	 	,	the	world	is	 be 	 ing 	 	driven	and	shaped	,	not	by	the	old	 develop 	 ed 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	,	but	by	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	.
We	've	 s 	 een 	 	 th 	 is 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	 G 	 20 	 	 usurp 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 rapid 	 ly 	 	the	position	of	the	 G 	 7 	 	,	or	the	 G 	 8 	 	.
And	there	are	two	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
First	,	the	West	is	 rapid 	 ly 	 	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	 it 	 s 	 	influence	in	the	world	.
There	was	a	 dramat 	 ic 	 	 illustr 	 ation 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	year	ago	--	 C 	 open 	 ha 	 gen 	 	,	climate	change	 con 	 ference 	 	.
 Euro 	 pe 	 	was	not	at	the	final	 negoti 	 ating 	 	table	.
When	did	that	last	happen	?
I	would	 wage 	 r 	 	it	was	 prob 	 ably 	 	about	200	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
And	that	is	what	is	going	to	happen	in	the	future	.
And	the	second	 implic 	 ation 	 	is	that	the	world	will	 inevit 	 ably 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	 con 	 sequence 	 	,	 be 	 come 	 	 increasing 	 ly 	 	 un 	 familiar 	 	to	us	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	'll	be	shaped	by	 culture 	 s 	 	and	 experience 	 s 	 	and	 histo 	 ries 	 	that	we	are	not	 re 	 ally 	 	familiar	with	,	or	 con 	 ver 	 s 	 ant 	 	with	.
And	at	last	,	I	'm	 af 	 raid 	 	--	take	 Euro 	 pe 	 	;	America	is	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	different	--	but	 European 	 s 	 	by	and	large	,	I	have	to	say	,	are	 ignor 	 ant 	 	,	are	 un 	 aware 	 	about	the	way	the	world	is	changing	.
Some	people	--	I	've	got	an	English	friend	in	China	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	The	continent	is	 sleep 	 walk 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 obliv 	 ion 	 	.	''
Well	,	 may 	 be 	 	that	's	true	,	 may 	 be 	 	that	's	an	 exagge 	 ration 	 	.
But	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	problem	which	 go 	 es 	 	 a 	 long 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	--	that	 Euro 	 pe 	 	is	 increasing 	 ly 	 	out	of	touch	with	the	world	--	and	that	is	a	sort	of	loss	of	a	sense	of	the	future	.
I	mean	,	 Euro 	 pe 	 	once	,	of	course	,	once	 command 	 ed 	 	the	future	in	 it 	 s 	 	confidence	.
Take	the	19th	century	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
But	 th 	 is 	 	,	 ala 	 s 	 	,	is	no	 long 	 er 	 	true	.
If	you	want	to	feel	the	future	,	if	you	want	to	taste	the	future	,	try	China	--	there	's	old	 Con 	 fuc 	 ius 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	 rail 	 way 	 	station	the	 like 	 s 	 	of	which	you	've	never	 s 	 een 	 	before	.
It	 do 	 es 	 	n't	even	look	like	a	 rail 	 way 	 	station	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	new	 Gua 	 ng 	 zhou 	 	 rail 	 way 	 	station	for	the	 high 	 - 	 speed 	 	 train 	 s 	 	.
China	 al 	 ready 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 big 	 ger 	 	network	than	any	other	country	in	the	world	and	will	soon	have	more	than	all	the	rest	of	the	world	put	together	.
Or	take	 th 	 is 	 	:	now	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	idea	,	but	it	's	an	idea	to	be	 tri 	 ed 	 	out	 short 	 ly 	 	in	a	suburb	of	 Beij 	 ing 	 	.
 He 	 re 	 	you	have	a	 mega 	 bus 	 	,	on	the	upper	deck	 car 	 ries 	 	about	2,000	people	.
It	 travel 	 s 	 	on	 rail 	 s 	 	down	a	 sub 	 urban 	 	road	,	and	the	 car 	 s 	 	travel	 under 	 neath 	 	it	.
And	it	 do 	 es 	 	 speed 	 s 	 	of	up	to	about	100	 mile 	 s 	 	an	hour	.
 N 	 ow 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	way	 thing 	 s 	 	are	going	to	move	,	 be 	 cause 	 	China	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	specific	problem	,	which	is	different	from	 Euro 	 pe 	 	and	different	from	the	 Unit 	 ed 	 	 Stat 	 es 	 	:	China	 ha 	 s 	 	huge	 number 	 s 	 	of	people	and	no	space	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	solution	to	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	where	China	's	going	to	have	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	cities	over	20	million	people	.
 Oka 	 y 	 	,	so	how	would	I	like	to	finish	?
Well	,	what	should	our	attitude	be	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	world	that	we	see	 ver 	 y 	 	 rapid 	 ly 	 	 develop 	 ing 	 	before	us	?
I	think	there	will	be	good	 thing 	 s 	 	about	it	and	there	will	be	bad	 thing 	 s 	 	about	it	.
But	I	want	to	 argu 	 e 	 	,	above	all	,	a	 big 	 - 	 picture 	 	positive	for	 th 	 is 	 	world	.
For	200	 year 	 s 	 	,	the	world	was	 essential 	 ly 	 	 govern 	 ed 	 	by	a	fragment	of	the	human	population	.
That	's	what	 Euro 	 pe 	 	and	North	America	 represent 	 ed 	 	.
The	 arriv 	 al 	 	of	 count 	 ries 	 	like	China	and	India	--	between	them	38	percent	of	the	world	's	population	--	and	 other 	 s 	 	like	Indonesia	and	Brazil	and	so	on	,	represent	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	single	act	of	 democrat 	 ization 	 	in	the	last	200	 year 	 s 	 	.
 Civil 	 ization 	 s 	 	and	 culture 	 s 	 	,	which	had	 be 	 en 	 	 ignor 	 ed 	 	,	which	had	no	voice	,	which	 we 	 re 	 	not	 listen 	 ed 	 	to	,	which	 we 	 re 	 	not	known	about	,	will	have	a	different	sort	of	 represent 	 ation 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	world	.
 A 	 s 	 	 human 	 ists 	 	,	we	must	welcome	,	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 transform 	 ation 	 	,	and	we	will	have	to	learn	about	these	 civil 	 ization 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	big	ship	here	was	the	one	 s 	 ailed 	 	in	by	Zheng	He	in	the	early	15th	century	on	his	great	 voyage 	 s 	 	around	the	South	China	Sea	,	the	East	China	Sea	and	 a 	 cross 	 	the	Indian	Ocean	to	East	 Afri 	 ca 	 	.
The	little	boat	in	front	of	it	was	the	one	in	which	,	80	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	 Christ 	 oph 	 er 	 	 Col 	 um 	 bus 	 	 cross 	 ed 	 	the	Atlantic	.
Or	,	look	 care 	 fully 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	silk	scroll	made	by	 Z 	 hu 	 Zhou 	 	in	1368	.
I	think	they	're	 play 	 ing 	 	golf	.
Christ	,	the	 Chi 	 nese 	 	even	 invent 	 ed 	 	golf	.
 Wel 	 come 	 	to	the	future	.	Thank	you	.

 I 	 an 	 	 Gold 	 in 	 	:	 Navig 	 ating 	 	our	global	future
The	future	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	know	it	,	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 predict 	 able 	 	.
The	best	 mind 	 s 	 	in	the	best	 institution 	 s 	 	 general 	 ly 	 	get	it	wrong	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	in	technology	.	 Th 	 is 	 	is	in	the	area	of	 politic 	 s 	 	,	where	 pun 	 d 	 it 	 s 	 	,	the	 CI 	 A 	 	,	 MI 	 6 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	get	it	wrong	.
And	it	's	 clear 	 ly 	 	in	the	area	of	finance	.
With	 institution 	 s 	 	 establish 	 ed 	 	to	think	about	the	future	,	the	 IM 	 F 	 	,	the	 B 	 IS 	 	,	the	Financial	 St 	 ability 	 	 For 	 um 	 	,	could	n't	see	what	was	coming	.
Over	20,000	 economist 	 s 	 	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	job	it	is	,	competitive	entry	to	get	there	,	could	n't	see	what	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
 Global 	 ization 	 	is	 get 	 ting 	 	more	complex	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	change	is	 get 	 ting 	 	more	rapid	.
The	future	will	be	more	 un 	 predict 	 able 	 	.
coming	together	,	 lead 	 s 	 	to	a	new	 ren 	 aiss 	 ance 	 	.
It	did	 th 	 is 	 	a	thousand	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
The	last	40	 year 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 time 	 s 	 	.
Life	 expect 	 ancy 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	gone	up	by	about	25	 year 	 s 	 	.
It	took	from	the	Stone	Age	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	that	.
 In 	 come 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	gone	up	for	a	 major 	 ity 	 	of	the	world	's	population	,	 de 	 spite 	 	the	population	going	up	by	about	two	billion	people	over	 th 	 is 	 	period	.
And	 il 	 liter 	 acy 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	gone	down	,	from	a	half	to	about	a	quarter	of	the	people	on	Earth	.
A	huge	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	,	 unleash 	 ing 	 	of	new	potential	for	 innov 	 ation 	 	,	for	 develop 	 ment 	 	.
But	there	is	an	 under 	 bel 	 ly 	 	.
There	are	two	 A 	 chill 	 es 	 	'	 heel 	 s 	 	of	 global 	 ization 	 	.
There	is	the	 A 	 chill 	 es 	 	'	heel	of	growing	 ine 	 quality 	 	--	 t 	 hose 	 	that	are	left	out	,	 t 	 hose 	 	that	feel	 ang 	 ry 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	that	are	not	 particip 	 ating 	 	.	 Global 	 ization 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	not	 be 	 en 	 	inclusive	.
The	second	 A 	 chill 	 es 	 	'	heel	is	 complex 	 ity 	 	--	a	growing	 f 	 rag 	 ility 	 	,	a	growing	 brittle 	 ness 	 	.
What	 happen 	 s 	 	in	one	place	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	 affect 	 s 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	else	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	 system 	 ic 	 	risk	,	 system 	 ic 	 	shock	.
We	've	 s 	 een 	 	it	in	the	financial	crisis	.	We	've	 s 	 een 	 	it	in	the	 pan 	 demic 	 	flu	.
It	will	 be 	 come 	 	 virul 	 ent 	 	and	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	we	have	to	build	 resili 	 ence 	 	against	.
A	lot	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	driven	by	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	technology	.
There	have	 be 	 en 	 	huge	 leap 	 s 	 	.	There	will	be	a	 million 	 - 	 fold 	 	 improve 	 ment 	 	in	what	you	can	get	for	the	same	price	in	computing	by	2030	.
That	's	what	the	experience	of	the	last	20	 year 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	.
It	will	 continu 	 e 	 	.
Our	 computer 	 s 	 	,	our	 system 	 s 	 	will	be	 a 	 s 	 	primitive	 a 	 s 	 	the	Apollo	's	are	for	 to 	 day 	 	.
Our	mobile	 phone 	 s 	 	are	more	 power 	 ful 	 	than	the	total	Apollo	space	engine	.
Our	mobile	 phone 	 s 	 	are	more	 power 	 ful 	 	than	some	of	the	 strong 	 est 	 	 computer 	 s 	 	of	20	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
So	what	will	 th 	 is 	 	do	?
It	will	create	huge	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	in	technology	.
 Mini 	 atur 	 ization 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
There	will	be	 in 	 visible 	 	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	.	 In 	 visible 	 	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	in	our	bodies	,	in	our	 brain 	 s 	 	,	and	in	the	air	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	dust	mite	on	a	 nano 	 replica 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	sort	of	ability	to	do	 every 	 thing 	 	in	new	ways	 unleash 	 es 	 	potential	,	not	 l 	 east 	 	in	the	area	of	medicine	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	stem	cell	that	we	've	 develop 	 ed 	 	here	in	Oxford	,	from	an	 embryo 	 nic 	 	stem	cell	.
We	can	develop	any	part	of	the	body	.
 Increas 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	over	time	,	 th 	 is 	 	will	be	possible	from	our	own	skin	--	able	to	replicate	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	body	.
 Fanta 	 s 	 tic 	 	potential	for	 re 	 generative 	 	medicine	.
I	do	n't	think	there	will	be	a	Special	 Olymp 	 ic 	 s 	 	long	after	2030	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	 re 	 generate 	 	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	body	.
But	the	question	is	,	``	Who	will	have	it	?	''
The	other	major	 develop 	 ment 	 	is	going	to	be	in	the	area	of	what	can	happen	in	 genetic 	 s 	 	.
The	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	create	,	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	mouse	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 genetic 	 ally 	 	 modifi 	 ed 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	which	 go 	 es 	 	three	 time 	 s 	 	 fast 	 er 	 	,	 last 	 s 	 	for	three	 time 	 s 	 	 long 	 er 	 	,	we	could	produce	,	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	mouse	can	,	to	the	age	of	our	 equi 	 valent 	 	of	80	 year 	 s 	 	,	using	about	the	same	amount	of	food	.
But	will	 th 	 is 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	be	 avail 	 able 	 	for	the	super	rich	,	for	 t 	 hose 	 	that	can	afford	it	?	 A 	 re 	 	we	headed	for	a	new	eugenics	?
Will	 on 	 ly 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	that	are	able	to	afford	it	be	able	to	be	 th 	 is 	 	super	race	of	the	future	?
So	the	big	question	for	us	is	,	``	How	do	we	manage	 th 	 is 	 	 techno 	 logical 	 	change	?	''
How	do	we	ensure	that	it	 create 	 s 	 	a	more	inclusive	technology	,	a	technology	which	 mean 	 s 	 	that	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	grow	 old 	 er 	 	,	that	we	can	 al 	 so 	 	grow	 wis 	 er 	 	,	and	that	we	're	able	to	support	the	 population 	 s 	 	of	the	future	?
One	of	the	most	 dramat 	 ic 	 	 manifest 	 ations 	 	of	these	 improve 	 ments 	 	will	be	moving	from	population	 pyramid 	 s 	 	to	what	we	might	term	population	 coffin 	 s 	 	.
There	is	 un 	 like 	 ly 	 	to	be	a	pension	or	a	 retire 	 ment 	 	age	in	2030	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	will	be	 red 	 un 	 d 	 ant 	 	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	.	And	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	 on 	 ly 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	of	the	West	.
The	most	 dramat 	 ic 	 	 change 	 s 	 	will	be	the	 sky 	 scrap 	 er 	 	type	of	new	 pyramid 	 s 	 	that	will	take	place	in	China	and	in	 man 	 y 	 	other	 count 	 ries 	 	.
So	forget	about	 retire 	 ments 	 	if	you	're	young	.
Forget	about	 pension 	 s 	 	.	Think	about	life	and	where	it	's	going	to	be	going	.
Of	course	,	 migr 	 ation 	 	will	 be 	 come 	 	even	more	 import 	 ant 	 	.
The	war	on	talent	,	the	need	to	attract	people	at	all	skill	 range 	 s 	 	,	to	push	us	around	in	our	 wheelchair 	 s 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	to	drive	our	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	.	Our	 innov 	 ation 	 	will	be	vital	.
The	 employ 	 ment 	 	in	the	rich	 count 	 ries 	 	will	go	down	from	about	800	to	about	700	million	of	these	people	.
 Th 	 is 	 	would	 imp 	 ly 	 	a	massive	leap	in	 migr 	 ation 	 	.
So	the	 concern 	 s 	 	,	the	 xeno 	 phobic 	 	 concern 	 s 	 	of	 to 	 day 	 	,	of	 migr 	 ation 	 	,	will	be	 turn 	 ed 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	head	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	search	for	people	to	help	us	sort	out	our	 pension 	 s 	 	and	our	 eco 	 nomi 	 es 	 	in	the	future	.
And	then	,	the	 system 	 ic 	 	 risk 	 s 	 	.
We	understand	that	these	will	 be 	 come 	 	much	more	 virul 	 ent 	 	,	that	what	we	see	 to 	 day 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	 inter 	 weaving 	 	of	 socie 	 ties 	 	,	of	 system 	 s 	 	,	 fast 	 ened 	 	by	 techno 	 logies 	 	and	 ha 	 sten 	 ed 	 	by	 just 	 - 	 in 	 - 	 time 	 	management	 system 	 s 	 	.
Small	 level 	 s 	 	of	stock	push	 resili 	 ence 	 	 in 	 to 	 	other	people	's	 respons 	 ibility 	 	.
The	collapse	in	 bio 	 divers 	 ity 	 	,	climate	change	,	 pan 	 demic 	 s 	 	,	financial	 cri 	 s 	 es 	 	:	these	will	be	the	 curr 	 ency 	 	that	we	will	think	about	.
And	so	a	new	 aware 	 ness 	 	will	have	to	arise	,	of	how	we	deal	with	these	,	how	we	mobilize	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	in	a	new	way	,	and	come	together	 a 	 s 	 	a	community	to	manage	 system 	 ic 	 	risk	.
It	's	going	to	 requir 	 e 	 	 innov 	 ation 	 	.
It	's	going	to	 requir 	 e 	 	an	 understand 	 ing 	 	that	the	 glor 	 y 	 	of	 global 	 ization 	 	could	 al 	 so 	 	be	 it 	 s 	 	 down 	 fall 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	could	be	our	best	century	ever	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 achiev 	 ement 	 s 	 	,	or	it	could	be	our	worst	.
And	of	course	we	need	to	worry	about	the	 individual 	 s 	 	,	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	the	 individual 	 s 	 	that	feel	that	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	left	out	in	one	way	or	 an 	 other 	 	.
An	individual	,	for	the	first	time	in	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 human 	 ity 	 	,	will	have	the	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	,	by	2030	,	to	destroy	the	planet	,	to	wreck	 every 	 thing 	 	,	through	the	creation	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	of	a	 bio 	 pathogen 	 	.
How	do	we	begin	to	weave	these	 tape 	 s 	 tries 	 	together	?
How	do	we	think	about	complex	 system 	 s 	 	in	new	ways	?
That	will	be	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	of	the	 scholar 	 s 	 	,	and	of	all	of	us	 engag 	 ed 	 	in	 think 	 ing 	 	about	the	future	.
The	rest	of	our	 live 	 s 	 	will	be	in	the	future	.	We	need	to	 prep 	 are 	 	for	it	now	.
We	need	to	understand	that	the	 govern 	 ance 	 	structure	in	the	world	is	 fossil 	 ized 	 	.
It	can	not	begin	to	cope	with	the	 challeng 	 es 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	will	 br 	 ing 	 	.
We	have	to	develop	a	new	way	of	 man 	 aging 	 	the	planet	,	 collect 	 ively 	 	,	through	 collect 	 ive 	 	 wis 	 dom 	 	.
We	know	,	and	I	know	from	my	own	experience	,	that	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	can	happen	,	when	 individual 	 s 	 	and	 socie 	 ties 	 	come	together	to	change	 the 	 ir 	 	future	.
I	left	South	 Afri 	 ca 	 	,	and	15	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	after	 think 	 ing 	 	I	would	never	go	back	,	I	had	the	privilege	and	the	honor	to	work	in	the	government	of	 Nel 	 son 	 	 Man 	 del 	 a 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	was	a	miracle	.	We	can	create	 miracle 	 s 	 	,	 collect 	 ively 	 	,	in	our	 life 	 time 	 	.
It	is	vital	that	we	do	so	.
It	is	vital	that	the	 idea 	 s 	 	that	are	 nurture 	 d 	 	in	TED	,	that	the	 idea 	 s 	 	that	we	think	about	look	forward	,	and	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	 th 	 is 	 	will	be	the	most	 glor 	 ious 	 	century	,	and	not	one	of	 eco 	 - 	 disaster 	 	and	 eco 	 - 	 collapse 	 	.
Thank	you	.

 Ra 	 gha 	 va 	 	 K 	 K 	 	:	Five	 live 	 s 	 	of	an	artist
I	think	it	was	in	my	second	grade	that	I	was	caught	 draw 	 ing 	 	the	bust	of	a	 nud 	 e 	 	by	 Michel 	 angel 	 o 	 	.
I	was	 s 	 ent 	 	straight	away	to	my	school	principal	,	and	my	school	principal	,	a	sweet	 n 	 un 	 	,	 look 	 ed 	 	at	my	book	with	disgust	,	 flip 	 ped 	 	through	the	 page 	 s 	 	,	saw	all	the	 nud 	 es 	 	--	you	know	,	I	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	my	mother	draw	 nud 	 es 	 	and	I	'd	copy	her	--	and	the	 n 	 un 	 	 s 	 lap 	 ped 	 	me	on	my	face	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Sweet	 Je 	 s 	 us 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	kid	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	 beg 	 un 	 	.	''
I	had	no	clue	what	she	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	,	but	it	was	convincing	 en 	 ough 	 	for	me	never	to	draw	 aga 	 in 	 	 un 	 til 	 	the	 n 	 in 	 th 	 	grade	.
 Thank 	 s 	 	to	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 bor 	 ing 	 	 lectur 	 e 	 	,	I	 start 	 ed 	 	 caricatur 	 ing 	 	my	 teacher 	 s 	 	in	school	.
And	,	you	know	,	I	got	a	lot	of	 popular 	 ity 	 	.
I	do	n't	play	 s 	 port 	 s 	 	.	I	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	at	 s 	 port 	 s 	 	.
I	do	n't	have	the	 fanci 	 est 	 	 gadget 	 s 	 	at	home	.
I	'm	not	on	top	of	the	class	.
So	for	me	,	 cartoon 	 ing 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	me	a	sense	of	 ident 	 ity 	 	.
I	got	popular	,	but	I	was	 scar 	 ed 	 	I	'd	get	caught	 aga 	 in 	 	.
So	what	I	did	was	I	 quick 	 ly 	 	put	together	a	collage	of	all	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	I	had	drawn	,	 glor 	 ified 	 	my	school	principal	,	put	him	right	on	top	,	and	 gift 	 ed 	 	it	to	him	.
He	had	a	good	laugh	at	the	other	 teacher 	 s 	 	and	put	it	up	on	the	notice	board	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	part	of	that	.
And	I	 be 	 came 	 	a	school	hero	.
All	my	 senior 	 s 	 	 k 	 new 	 	me	.	I	felt	 re 	 ally 	 	special	.
I	have	to	tell	you	a	little	bit	about	my	family	.
That	's	my	mother	.	I	love	her	to	bits	.
She	's	the	one	who	taught	me	how	to	draw	and	,	more	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	how	to	love	.
She	's	a	bit	of	a	 hip 	 pie 	 	.
She	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Do	n't	say	that	,	''	but	I	'm	 say 	 ing 	 	it	 any 	 way 	 	.
The	rest	of	my	family	are	 bor 	 ing 	 	 academic 	 s 	 	,	 bus 	 y 	 	 collect 	 ing 	 	 I 	 vy 	 	League	 dec 	 al 	 s 	 	for	our	classic	Ambassador	car	.
My	father	's	a	little	different	.
My	father	 believ 	 ed 	 	in	a	 hol 	 istic 	 	approach	to	living	,	and	,	you	know	,	every	time	he	taught	us	,	he	'd	say	,	``	I	hate	these	 book 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	these	 book 	 s 	 	are	 hijack 	 ed 	 	by	 Indus 	 trial 	 	 R 	 evolution 	 	.	''
 Whi 	 le 	 	he	still	held	that	 world 	 view 	 	,	I	was	16	,	I	got	the	best	lawyer	in	town	,	my	 old 	 er 	 	brother	 K 	 art 	 hik 	 	,	and	I	 s 	 at 	 	him	down	,	and	I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Pa	,	from	 to 	 day 	 	 on 	 ward 	 s 	 	I	've	 decide 	 d 	 	I	'm	going	to	be	 discipline 	 d 	 	,	I	'm	going	to	be	 cur 	 ious 	 	,	I	'm	going	to	learn	 some 	 thing 	 	new	every	day	,	I	'm	going	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	 work 	 ing 	 	,	and	I	'm	not	going	to	depend	on	you	 emotion 	 ally 	 	or	 financial 	 ly 	 	.	''
And	he	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 impress 	 ed 	 	.	He	was	all	 tear 	 ing 	 	up	.	 Read 	 y 	 	to	hug	me	.
And	I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 Hol 	 d 	 	that	thought	.	''
I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Can	I	quit	school	then	?	''
But	,	to	cut	a	long	story	short	,	I	quit	school	to	pursue	a	 care 	 er 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 cartoon 	 ist 	 	.
I	must	have	 d 	 one 	 	about	30,000	 caricatur 	 es 	 	.
I	would	do	 birth 	 day 	 	 part 	 ies 	 	,	 wed 	 d 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	 divorce 	 s 	 	,	 any 	 thing 	 	for	 any 	 one 	 	who	 want 	 ed 	 	to	use	my	 service 	 s 	 	.
But	,	most	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	while	I	was	 travel 	 ing 	 	,	I	taught	children	 cartoon 	 ing 	 	,	and	in	 ex 	 change 	 	,	I	 learn 	 ed 	 	how	to	be	 spontane 	 ous 	 	.
And	mad	and	crazy	and	 f 	 un 	 	.
When	I	 start 	 ed 	 	 teach 	 ing 	 	them	,	I	 s 	 aid 	 	let	me	start	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 professional 	 ly 	 	.
When	I	was	18	I	 start 	 ed 	 	my	own	school	.
 How 	 ever 	 	,	an	18	 year 	 - 	 old 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	start	a	school	is	not	easy	 un 	 less 	 	you	have	a	big	patron	or	a	big	 support 	 er 	 	.
So	I	was	 flip 	 ping 	 	through	the	 page 	 s 	 	of	the	 Time 	 s 	 	of	India	when	I	saw	that	the	 Prim 	 e 	 	 Mini 	 ster 	 	of	India	was	 visit 	 ing 	 	my	home	town	,	 Bang 	 al 	 ore 	 	.
And	,	you	know	,	just	like	how	every	 cartoon 	 ist 	 	 know 	 s 	 	Bush	here	,	and	if	you	had	to	meet	Bush	,	it	would	be	the	 f 	 un 	 nest 	 	thing	 be 	 cause 	 	his	face	was	a	 cartoon 	 ist 	 	's	 de 	 light 	 	.
I	had	to	meet	my	 Prim 	 e 	 	 Mini 	 ster 	 	.
I	went	to	the	place	where	his	helicopter	was	about	to	land	.
I	saw	 layer 	 s 	 	of	security	.
I	 caricatur 	 ed 	 	my	way	through	three	 layer 	 s 	 	by	just	 impress 	 ing 	 	the	 guard 	 s 	 	,	but	I	got	 s 	 tuck 	 	.	I	got	 s 	 tuck 	 	at	the	third	.
And	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	was	,	to	my	luck	,	I	saw	a	nuclear	scientist	at	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	party	I	had	 d 	 one 	 	 cartoon 	 s 	 	.
I	ran	up	to	him	,	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 Hell 	 o 	 	,	 s 	 ir 	 	.	How	do	you	do	?	''
He	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	What	are	you	 do 	 ing 	 	here	,	 Ra 	 gha 	 va 	 	?	''
I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	I	'm	here	to	meet	the	 Prim 	 e 	 	 Mini 	 ster 	 	.	''
He	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Oh	,	so	am	I	.	''
I	hopped	 in 	 to 	 	his	car	,	and	off	we	went	through	the	 remain 	 ing 	 	 layer 	 s 	 	of	security	.
Thank	you	.
I	 s 	 at 	 	him	down	,	I	 caricatur 	 ed 	 	him	,	and	since	then	I	've	 caricatur 	 ed 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 celebr 	 ities 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	one	I	remember	 fond 	 ly 	 	.
 Sal 	 man 	 	 Rush 	 die 	 	was	 piss 	 ed 	 - 	 off 	 	I	think	 be 	 cause 	 	I	 alter 	 ed 	 	the	map	of	New	York	,	if	you	notice	.
 Any 	 way 	 	,	the	next	slide	I	'm	about	to	show	you	--	Should	I	just	turn	that	off	?
The	next	slide	I	'm	about	to	show	you	,	is	a	little	more	serious	.
I	was	 hesit 	 ant 	 	to	include	 th 	 is 	 	in	my	 present 	 ation 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	cartoon	was	 publish 	 ed 	 	soon	after	9/11	.
What	was	,	for	me	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	naive	 observ 	 ation 	 	,	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	to	be	a	disaster	.
That	 even 	 ing 	 	,	I	came	home	to	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	hate	 mail 	 s 	 	,	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	people	 tell 	 ing 	 	me	how	they	could	have	lived	 an 	 other 	 	day	 with 	 out 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
I	was	 al 	 so 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	 leav 	 e 	 	the	 organ 	 ization 	 	,	a	 cartoon 	 ists 	 	'	 organ 	 ization 	 	in	America	,	that	for	me	was	my	 life 	 line 	 	.
That	's	when	I	 real 	 ized 	 	,	you	know	,	 cartoon 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	,	art	 come 	 s 	 	with	 respons 	 ibility 	 	.
 Any 	 way 	 	,	what	I	did	was	I	 decide 	 d 	 	that	I	need	to	take	a	break	.
I	quit	my	job	at	the	 paper 	 s 	 	,	I	closed	my	school	,	and	I	 wrap 	 ped 	 	up	my	 pencil 	 s 	 	and	my	 brush 	 es 	 	and	 ink 	 s 	 	,	and	I	 decide 	 d 	 	to	go	 travel 	 ing 	 	.
When	I	went	 travel 	 ing 	 	,	I	remember	,	I	met	 th 	 is 	 	fabulous	old	man	,	who	I	met	when	I	was	 caricatur 	 ing 	 	,	who	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	to	be	an	artist	,	in	 It 	 a 	 ly 	 	.
He	 invit 	 ed 	 	me	to	his	studio	.	He	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Come	and	visit	.	''
When	I	went	,	I	saw	the	 ghast 	 liest 	 	thing	ever	.
I	saw	 th 	 is 	 	dead	,	naked	effigy	of	 him 	 self 	 	 hang 	 ing 	 	from	the	 ceil 	 ing 	 	.
I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Oh	,	my	God	.	What	is	that	?	''
And	I	 ask 	 ed 	 	him	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Oh	,	that	thing	?	In	the	night	,	I	die	.
In	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	I	am	born	 aga 	 in 	 	.	''
I	thought	he	was	 ko 	 o 	 	 ko 	 o 	 	,	but	 some 	 thing 	 	about	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 tuck 	 	.
I	 love 	 d 	 	it	.	I	thought	there	was	 some 	 thing 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	about	that	.
So	I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	I	am	dead	,	so	I	need	to	be	born	 aga 	 in 	 	.	''
So	,	I	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	a	 paint 	 er 	 	like	him	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	,	I	do	n't	know	how	to	paint	.
So	,	I	 tri 	 ed 	 	going	to	the	art	store	.
You	know	,	there	are	a	hundred	 type 	 s 	 	of	 brush 	 es 	 	.
Forget	it	,	they	will	 con 	 fuse 	 	you	even	if	you	know	how	to	draw	.
So	I	 decide 	 d 	 	,	I	'm	going	to	learn	to	paint	by	 my 	 self 	 	.
I	'm	going	to	show	you	a	 ver 	 y 	 	quick	clip	to	show	you	how	I	 paint 	 ed 	 	and	a	little	bit	about	my	city	,	 Bang 	 al 	 ore 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	had	to	be	 large 	 r 	 	than	life	.
 Every 	 thing 	 	had	to	be	 large 	 r 	 	.	The	next	 paint 	 ing 	 	was	even	 big 	 ger 	 	.
And	even	 big 	 ger 	 	.
And	for	me	it	was	,	I	had	to	dance	while	I	 paint 	 ed 	 	.
It	was	so	 excit 	 ing 	 	.
 Ex 	 cept 	 	,	I	even	 start 	 ed 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 	 danc 	 ers 	 	.
 He 	 re 	 	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	is	a	Flamenco	 danc 	 er 	 	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	there	was	one	problem	.
I	did	n't	know	the	dance	form	,	so	I	 start 	 ed 	 	 follow 	 ing 	 	them	,	and	I	made	some	money	,	 s 	 old 	 	my	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	and	would	rush	off	to	 Franc 	 e 	 	or	 Spa 	 in 	 	and	work	with	them	.
That	's	 Pe 	 pe 	 	 Lin 	 are 	 s 	 	,	the	 ren 	 owned 	 	Flamenco	 s 	 ing 	 er 	 	.
But	I	had	one	problem	,	my	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	never	 danc 	 ed 	 	.
 A 	 s 	 	much	energy	 a 	 s 	 	I	put	 in 	 to 	 	them	while	making	them	,	they	never	 danc 	 ed 	 	.
So	I	 decide 	 d 	 	--	I	had	 th 	 is 	 	crazy	 epiph 	 any 	 	at	two	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
I	 call 	 ed 	 	my	 friend 	 s 	 	,	 paint 	 ed 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	bodies	,	and	had	them	dance	in	front	of	a	 paint 	 ing 	 	.
And	,	all	of	a	sudden	,	my	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	came	 al 	 ive 	 	.
And	then	I	was	fortunate	 en 	 ough 	 	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	perform	 th 	 is 	 	in	California	with	 Velo 	 city 	 	 Cir 	 cus 	 	.
And	I	 s 	 at 	 	like	you	 guy 	 s 	 	there	in	the	audience	.
And	I	saw	my	work	come	 al 	 ive 	 	.
You	know	,	 normal 	 ly 	 	you	work	in	 isol 	 ation 	 	,	and	you	show	at	a	 gall 	 ery 	 	,	but	here	,	the	work	was	coming	 al 	 ive 	 	,	and	it	had	some	other	 artist 	 s 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	with	me	.
The	 collabor 	 ative 	 	effort	was	fabulous	.
I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	I	'm	going	to	 collabor 	 ate 	 	with	 any 	 body 	 	and	 every 	 body 	 	I	meet	.
I	 start 	 ed 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	fashion	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	fashion	show	we	held	in	London	.
The	best	 collabor 	 ation 	 	,	of	course	,	is	with	children	.
 The 	 y 	 	are	 ruth 	 less 	 	,	they	are	honest	,	but	they	're	full	of	energy	and	 f 	 un 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	work	,	a	library	I	designed	for	the	Robin	 Hoo 	 d 	 	 Found 	 ation 	 	.
And	I	must	say	,	I	 s 	 pent 	 	time	in	the	Bronx	 work 	 ing 	 	with	these	 kid 	 s 	 	.
And	,	in	 ex 	 change 	 	for	me	 work 	 ing 	 	with	them	,	they	taught	me	how	to	be	cool	.
I	do	n't	think	I	've	 succeed 	 ed 	 	,	but	they	've	taught	me	.
 The 	 y 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 S 	 top 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	sorry	.	Say	,	my	bad	.	''
 Th 	 en 	 	I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	all	 th 	 is 	 	is	good	,	but	I	want	to	paint	like	a	real	 paint 	 er 	 	.
American	education	is	so	expensive	.
I	was	in	India	,	and	I	was	 walk 	 ing 	 	down	the	 street 	 s 	 	,	and	I	saw	a	 bill 	 board 	 	 paint 	 er 	 	.
And	these	 guy 	 s 	 	paint	 hum 	 ong 	 ous 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	and	they	look	 re 	 ally 	 	good	.
And	I	 wonder 	 ed 	 	how	they	did	it	from	so	close	.
So	,	one	day	I	had	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	meet	one	of	these	 guy 	 s 	 	,	and	I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	How	do	you	paint	like	that	?	Who	taught	you	?	''
And	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Oh	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	easy	.	I	can	teach	you	,	but	we	're	 leav 	 ing 	 	the	city	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 bill 	 board 	 	 paint 	 ers 	 	are	a	 dy 	 ing 	 	,	extinct	bunch	of	 artist 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	digital	 print 	 ing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 total 	 ly 	 	 replace 	 d 	 	them	and	 hijack 	 ed 	 	them	.	''
I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	in	 ex 	 change 	 	for	education	in	how	to	paint	,	I	will	support	them	,	and	I	 start 	 ed 	 	a	company	.
And	since	then	,	I	've	 be 	 en 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 	all	over	the	place	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	 paint 	 ing 	 	I	did	of	my	wife	in	my	 a 	 part 	 ment 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 	.
And	,	in	fact	,	I	 start 	 ed 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 	on	 any 	 thing 	 	,	and	 start 	 ed 	 	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	them	around	town	.
Since	I	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	my	wife	,	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 collabor 	 ation 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	with	her	,	 Ne 	 tra 	 	.
 Ne 	 tra 	 	and	I	met	when	she	was	18	.
I	must	have	 be 	 en 	 	19	and	a	half	then	,	and	it	was	love	at	first	sight	.
I	lived	in	India	.	She	lived	in	America	.
She	'd	come	every	two	 month 	 s 	 	to	visit	me	,	and	then	I	 s 	 aid 	 	I	'm	the	man	,	I	'm	the	man	,	and	I	have	to	 reciproc 	 ate 	 	.
I	have	to	travel	seven	 ocean 	 s 	 	,	and	I	have	to	come	and	see	you	.
I	did	that	twice	,	and	I	went	broke	.
So	then	I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 Net 	 s 	 	,	what	do	I	do	?	''
She	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Why	do	n't	you	 s 	 end 	 	me	your	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	?
My	dad	 know 	 s 	 	a	bunch	of	rich	 guy 	 s 	 	.
We	'll	try	and	con	them	 in 	 to 	 	 buy 	 ing 	 	it	,	and	then	...	''
But	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	,	after	I	 s 	 ent 	 	the	 work 	 s 	 	to	her	,	that	her	dad	's	 friend 	 s 	 	,	like	most	of	you	,	are	 geek 	 s 	 	.
I	'm	 jok 	 ing 	 	.
No	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	big	 geek 	 s 	 	,	and	they	did	n't	know	much	about	art	.
So	 Ne 	 tra 	 	was	 s 	 tuck 	 	with	30	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	mine	.
So	what	we	did	was	we	 rent 	 ed 	 	a	little	van	and	we	drove	all	over	the	east	coast	 try 	 ing 	 	to	sell	it	.
She	 contact 	 ed 	 	 any 	 one 	 	and	 every 	 one 	 	who	was	 will 	 ing 	 	to	buy	my	work	.
She	made	 en 	 ough 	 	money	,	she	 s 	 old 	 	off	the	whole	 collect 	 ion 	 	and	made	 en 	 ough 	 	money	to	move	me	for	four	 year 	 s 	 	with	 lawyer 	 s 	 	,	a	company	,	 every 	 thing 	 	,	and	she	 be 	 came 	 	my	 manage 	 r 	 	.
That	's	us	in	New	York	.
 Not 	 ice 	 	one	thing	,	we	're	equal	here	.
 Some 	 thing 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	 a 	 long 	 	the	line	.
But	 th 	 is 	 	 br 	 ought 	 	me	--	with	 Ne 	 tra 	 	 man 	 aging 	 	my	 care 	 er 	 	--	it	 br 	 ought 	 	me	a	lot	of	success	.
I	was	 re 	 ally 	 	happy	.	I	thought	of	 my 	 self 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	bit	of	a	 rock 	 star 	 	.
I	 love 	 d 	 	the	attention	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	all	the	press	we	got	,	and	we	 s 	 aid 	 	,	it	's	time	to	 celebr 	 ate 	 	.
And	I	 s 	 aid 	 	that	the	best	way	to	 celebr 	 ate 	 	is	to	marry	 Ne 	 tra 	 	.
I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Let	's	get	married	.	''
And	I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Not	just	married	.	Let	's	 invit 	 e 	 	 every 	 one 	 	who	's	 help 	 ed 	 	us	,	all	the	people	who	 b 	 ought 	 	our	work	.	''
And	you	wo	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	it	,	we	put	together	a	list	of	7,000	people	,	who	had	made	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	--	a	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	list	,	but	I	was	 determine 	 d 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	them	to	India	,	so	--	a	lot	of	them	 we 	 re 	 	in	India	.
150	 artist 	 s 	 	 volunteer 	 ed 	 	to	help	me	with	my	 wed 	 d 	 ing 	 	.
We	had	fashion	 design 	 ers 	 	,	 install 	 ation 	 	 artist 	 s 	 	,	 model 	 s 	 	,	we	had	 make 	 up 	 	 artist 	 s 	 	,	 jewel 	 ry 	 	 design 	 ers 	 	,	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	people	 work 	 ing 	 	with	me	to	make	my	 wed 	 d 	 ing 	 	an	art	 install 	 ation 	 	.
And	I	had	a	special	 install 	 ation 	 	in	tribute	to	my	 in 	 - 	 law 	 s 	 	.
I	had	the	 veget 	 able 	 	 carv 	 ers 	 	work	on	that	for	me	.
But	all	 th 	 is 	 	 excit 	 ement 	 	led	to	the	press	writing	about	us	.
We	 we 	 re 	 	in	the	 paper 	 s 	 	,	we	're	still	in	the	news	three	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	but	,	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	tragic	 happen 	 ed 	 	right	after	.
My	mother	fell	 ver 	 y 	 	ill	.
I	love	my	mother	and	I	was	told	all	of	a	sudden	that	she	was	going	to	die	.
And	they	 s 	 aid 	 	you	have	to	say	bye	to	her	,	you	have	to	do	what	you	have	to	do	.
And	I	was	 deva 	 state 	 d 	 	.
I	had	 show 	 s 	 	 book 	 ed 	 	up	for	 an 	 other 	 	year	.
I	was	on	a	high	.
And	I	could	n't	.	I	could	not	.
My	life	was	not	 ex 	 uber 	 ant 	 	.
I	could	not	live	 th 	 is 	 	 large 	 r 	 	than	life	person	.
I	 start 	 ed 	 	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	the	 dark 	 er 	 	 abscess 	 es 	 	of	the	human	mind	.
Of	course	,	my	work	 turn 	 ed 	 	 ug 	 ly 	 	,	but	 an 	 other 	 	thing	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
I	lost	all	my	 audience 	 s 	 	.
The	Bollywood	 star 	 s 	 	who	I	would	party	with	and	buy	my	work	 disappear 	 ed 	 	.
The	 collect 	 ors 	 	,	the	 friend 	 s 	 	,	the	press	,	 every 	 one 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 Nic 	 e 	 	,	but	thank	you	.	''
``	No	thank	you	,	''	was	more	like	it	.
But	I	 want 	 ed 	 	people	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	feel	my	work	from	 the 	 ir 	 	gut	,	 be 	 cause 	 	I	was	 paint 	 ing 	 	it	from	my	gut	.
If	they	 want 	 ed 	 	 beaut 	 y 	 	,	I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 beaut 	 y 	 	I	'm	 will 	 ing 	 	to	give	you	.	It	's	 politic 	 ized 	 	.
Of	course	,	 non 	 e 	 	of	them	 like 	 d 	 	it	.
My	 work 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	 auto 	 bio 	 graphical 	 	.
At	 th 	 is 	 	point	,	 some 	 thing 	 	else	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
A	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	dear	friend	of	mine	came	out	of	the	 close 	 t 	 	,	and	in	India	at	that	time	,	it	was	 il 	 legal 	 	to	be	 ga 	 y 	 	,	and	it	's	 disgust 	 ing 	 	to	see	how	people	respond	to	a	 ga 	 y 	 	person	.
I	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 up 	 set 	 	.
I	remember	the	time	when	my	mother	used	to	dress	me	up	 a 	 s 	 	a	little	girl	--	that	's	me	there	--	 be 	 cause 	 	she	 want 	 ed 	 	a	girl	,	and	she	 ha 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	 boy 	 s 	 	.
 Any 	 way 	 	,	I	do	n't	know	what	my	 friend 	 s 	 	are	going	to	say	after	 th 	 is 	 	talk	.
It	's	a	secret	.
So	,	after	 th 	 is 	 	,	my	 work 	 s 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	a	little	violent	.
I	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	 mascu 	 lin 	 ity 	 	that	one	need	not	perform	.
And	I	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	the	 weak 	 ness 	 	of	male	 sexual 	 ity 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	time	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	did	my	 collect 	 ors 	 	disappear	,	the	 politic 	 al 	 	 activist 	 s 	 	 decide 	 d 	 	to	ban	me	and	to	threaten	me	and	to	forbid	me	from	 show 	 ing 	 	.
It	 turn 	 ed 	 	nasty	,	and	I	'm	a	bit	of	a	chicken	.
I	ca	n't	deal	with	any	threat	.	 Th 	 is 	 	was	a	big	threat	.
So	,	I	 decide 	 d 	 	it	was	time	to	end	and	go	back	home	.
 Th 	 is 	 	time	I	 s 	 aid 	 	let	's	try	 some 	 thing 	 	different	.
I	need	to	be	 re 	 born 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.
And	I	thought	the	best	way	,	 a 	 s 	 	most	of	you	know	who	have	children	,	the	best	way	to	have	a	new	lease	on	life	,	is	to	have	a	child	.
I	 decide 	 d 	 	to	have	a	child	,	and	before	I	did	that	,	I	 quick 	 ly 	 	 stud 	 ied 	 	what	can	go	wrong	.
How	can	a	family	get	 dy 	 s 	 functional 	 	?
And	 Ru 	 dra 	 	was	born	.
That	's	my	little	son	.
And	two	 magic 	 al 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	after	he	was	born	.
My	mother	 miracul 	 ously 	 	 re 	 cover 	 ed 	 	after	a	serious	operation	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	man	was	 elect 	 ed 	 	 p 	 resident 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	country	.
You	know	I	 s 	 at 	 	at	home	and	I	 watch 	 ed 	 	.
I	 tear 	 ed 	 	up	and	I	 s 	 aid 	 	that	's	where	I	want	to	be	.
So	 Ne 	 tra 	 	and	I	wound	up	our	life	,	closed	up	 every 	 thing 	 	we	had	,	and	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	move	to	New	York	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	was	just	eight	 month 	 s 	 	ago	.
I	 move 	 d 	 	back	to	New	York	,	my	work	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	.
 Every 	 thing 	 	about	my	work	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	more	 whim 	 s 	 ical 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	one	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	What	the	Fuck	 Wa 	 s 	 	I	 Think 	 ing 	 	?	''
It	 talk 	 s 	 	about	mental	 inc 	 est 	 	.
You	know	,	I	may	appear	to	be	a	 ver 	 y 	 	nice	,	clean	,	sweet	boy	.
But	I	'm	not	.	I	'm	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 think 	 ing 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	.
But	I	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	civil	in	my	action	,	I	assure	you	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	just	different	 cartoon 	 s 	 	.
And	,	before	I	go	,	I	want	to	tell	you	a	little	story	.
I	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	mother	and	father	 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	and	my	dad	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	I	know	you	have	so	much	you	want	to	say	,	but	you	have	to	talk	about	your	work	with	children	.	''
So	I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
I	work	with	children	all	over	the	world	,	and	that	's	an	 entire 	 ly 	 	different	talk	,	but	I	want	to	 leav 	 e 	 	you	with	one	story	that	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	inspired	me	.
I	met	 Bel 	 in 	 da 	 	when	she	was	16	.
I	was	17	.
I	was	in	Australia	,	and	 Bel 	 in 	 da 	 	had	cancer	,	and	I	was	told	she	's	not	going	to	live	 ver 	 y 	 	long	.
 The 	 y 	 	,	in	fact	,	told	me	three	 week 	 s 	 	.
I	walk	 in 	 to 	 	her	room	,	and	there	was	a	 s 	 hy 	 	girl	,	and	she	was	bald	,	and	she	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	hide	her	 bald 	 ness 	 	.
I	 whip 	 ped 	 	out	my	pen	,	and	I	 start 	 ed 	 	 draw 	 ing 	 	on	her	head	and	I	drew	a	crown	for	her	.
And	then	,	we	 start 	 ed 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	,	and	we	 s 	 pent 	 	a	 love 	 ly 	 	time	--	I	told	her	how	I	 end 	 ed 	 	up	in	Australia	,	how	I	 back 	 pack 	 ed 	 	and	who	I	 con 	 ned 	 	,	and	how	I	got	a	ticket	,	and	all	the	 st 	 ories 	 	.
And	I	drew	it	out	for	her	.
And	then	I	left	.
 Bel 	 in 	 da 	 	 di 	 ed 	 	and	 with 	 in 	 	a	few	 day 	 s 	 	of	her	death	,	they	 publish 	 ed 	 	a	book	for	her	,	and	she	used	my	cartoon	on	the	cover	.
And	she	wrote	a	little	note	,	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Hey	 Ra 	 g 	 s 	 	,	thank	you	for	the	magic	carpet	ride	around	the	world	.	''
For	me	,	my	art	is	my	magic	carpet	ride	.
I	hope	you	will	join	me	in	 th 	 is 	 	magic	carpet	ride	,	and	touch	children	and	be	honest	.
Thank	you	so	much	.

 Li 	 s 	 a 	 	 Gan 	 sky 	 	:	The	future	of	business	is	the	``	mesh	''
I	'm	 s 	 peaking 	 	to	you	about	what	I	call	the	``	mesh	.	''
It	's	 essential 	 ly 	 	a	fundamental	shift	in	our	relationship	with	stuff	,	with	the	 thing 	 s 	 	in	our	 live 	 s 	 	.
And	it	's	 start 	 ing 	 	to	look	at	--	not	 al 	 ways 	 	and	not	for	 every 	 thing 	 	--	but	in	certain	 moment 	 s 	 	of	time	,	access	to	certain	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 good 	 s 	 	and	service	will	trump	 owner 	 ship 	 	of	them	.
And	so	it	's	the	 pur 	 suit 	 	of	better	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 eas 	 ily 	 	 share 	 d 	 	.
And	we	come	from	a	long	tradition	of	sharing	.
We	've	 share 	 d 	 	 transport 	 ation 	 	.
We	've	 share 	 d 	 	wine	and	food	and	other	 sort 	 s 	 	of	fabulous	 experience 	 s 	 	in	coffee	 bar 	 s 	 	in	Amsterdam	.
We	've	 al 	 so 	 	 share 	 d 	 	other	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 entertain 	 ment 	 	--	 s 	 port 	 s 	 	 arena 	 s 	 	,	public	 park 	 s 	 	,	concert	 hall 	 s 	 	,	 lib 	 r 	 aries 	 	,	 un 	 ive 	 rs 	 ities 	 	.
All	these	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 share 	 - 	 platform 	 s 	 	,	but	sharing	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	 start 	 s 	 	and	 end 	 s 	 	with	what	I	refer	to	 a 	 s 	 	the	``	mother	of	all	 share 	 - 	 platform 	 s 	 	.	''
And	 a 	 s 	 	I	think	about	the	mesh	and	I	think	about	,	well	,	what	's	 driv 	 ing 	 	it	,	how	come	it	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	now	,	I	think	there	's	a	number	of	 vector 	 s 	 	that	I	want	to	give	you	 a 	 s 	 	 back 	 ground 	 	.
One	is	the	 recess 	 ion 	 	--	that	the	 recess 	 ion 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 caus 	 ed 	 	us	to	 re 	 think 	 	our	relationship	with	the	 thing 	 s 	 	in	our	 live 	 s 	 	 relat 	 ive 	 	to	the	value	--	so	 start 	 ing 	 	to	align	the	value	with	the	true	cost	.
 Second 	 ly 	 	,	population	growth	and	density	 in 	 to 	 	cities	.
 Mo 	 re 	 	people	,	 small 	 er 	 	 space 	 s 	 	,	less	stuff	.
Climate	change	:	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	stress	in	our	personal	 live 	 s 	 	and	in	our	 commun 	 ities 	 	and	on	the	planet	.
 Al 	 so 	 	,	there	's	 be 	 en 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 cent 	 	 dis 	 trust 	 	of	big	 brand 	 s 	 	,	global	big	 brand 	 s 	 	,	in	a	bunch	of	different	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	,	and	that	's	 create 	 d 	 	an	 open 	 ing 	 	.
 Re 	 search 	 	is	 show 	 ing 	 	here	,	in	the	 Stat 	 es 	 	,	and	in	Canada	and	Western	 Euro 	 pe 	 	,	that	most	of	us	are	much	more	open	to	local	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	,	or	 brand 	 s 	 	that	 may 	 be 	 	we	have	n't	heard	of	.
 Where 	 a 	 s 	 	before	,	we	went	with	the	big	 brand 	 s 	 	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	we	 trust 	 ed 	 	.
And	last	is	that	we	're	more	 connect 	 ed 	 	now	to	more	people	on	the	planet	than	ever	before	--	 ex 	 cept 	 	for	if	you	're	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	next	to	 some 	 one 	 	.
The	other	thing	that	's	worth	 consider 	 ing 	 	is	that	we	've	made	a	huge	 invest 	 ment 	 	over	 decade 	 s 	 	and	 decade 	 s 	 	,	and	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 dollar 	 s 	 	have	gone	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 invest 	 ment 	 	that	now	is	our	 inherit 	 ance 	 	.
It	's	a	physical	 infra 	 structure 	 	that	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	get	from	point	A	to	point	B	and	move	 thing 	 s 	 	that	way	.
It	's	 al 	 so 	 	--	Web	and	mobile	allow	us	to	be	 connect 	 ed 	 	and	create	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 platform 	 s 	 	and	 system 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 invest 	 ment 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	and	that	 infra 	 structure 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	our	 inherit 	 ance 	 	.
It	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	engage	in	 re 	 ally 	 	new	and	 interest 	 ing 	 	ways	.
And	so	for	me	,	a	mesh	company	,	the	``	classic	''	mesh	company	,	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	together	these	three	 thing 	 s 	 	:	our	ability	to	connect	to	each	other	--	most	of	us	are	 walk 	 ing 	 	around	with	these	mobile	 de 	 vice 	 s 	 	that	are	 GP 	 S 	 - 	 enabled 	 	and	 Web 	 - 	 enabled 	 	--	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	find	each	other	and	find	 thing 	 s 	 	in	time	and	space	.
And	third	is	that	physical	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 read 	 able 	 	on	a	map	--	so	 restaurant 	 s 	 	,	a	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	 venue 	 s 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	with	 GP 	 S 	 	and	other	technology	like	 RFI 	 D 	 	and	it	 continu 	 es 	 	to	expand	beyond	that	,	we	can	 al 	 so 	 	track	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	moving	,	like	a	car	,	a	 taxi 	 cab 	 	,	a	transit	system	,	a	box	that	's	moving	through	time	and	space	.
And	so	that	 set 	 s 	 	up	for	making	access	to	get	 good 	 s 	 	and	 service 	 s 	 	more	convenient	and	less	 cost 	 ly 	 	in	 man 	 y 	 	 case 	 s 	 	than	 own 	 ing 	 	them	.
For	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	I	want	to	use	 Zip 	 car 	 	.
How	 man 	 y 	 	people	here	have	 experience 	 d 	 	 car 	 - 	 sharing 	 	or	 bike 	 - 	 sharing 	 	?
 W 	 ow 	 	,	that	's	great	.	 Oka 	 y 	 	,	thank	you	.
is	the	largest	 car 	 - 	 sharing 	 	company	in	the	world	.
 The 	 y 	 	did	not	invent	 car 	 - 	 sharing 	 	.
 Car 	 - 	 sharing 	 	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 invent 	 ed 	 	in	 Euro 	 pe 	 	.
One	of	the	 founder 	 s 	 	went	to	 Switzer 	 land 	 	,	saw	it	 implement 	 ed 	 	 some 	 place 	 	,	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 W 	 ow 	 	,	that	 look 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	.
I	think	we	can	do	that	in	 Cam 	 bridge 	 	,	''	 br 	 ought 	 	it	to	 Cam 	 bridge 	 	and	they	 start 	 ed 	 	--	two	women	--	Robin	 Cha 	 s 	 e 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	the	other	person	who	 start 	 ed 	 	it	.
 Zip 	 car 	 	got	some	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	right	.
First	,	they	 re 	 ally 	 	 under 	 stood 	 	that	a	brand	is	a	voice	and	a	product	is	a	souvenir	.
And	so	they	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	clever	about	the	way	that	they	 package 	 d 	 	 car 	 - 	 sharing 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	made	it	sexy	.	 The 	 y 	 	made	it	fresh	.
 The 	 y 	 	made	it	 aspir 	 ation 	 al 	 	.
If	you	 we 	 re 	 	a	member	of	the	club	,	when	you	're	a	member	of	a	club	,	you	're	a	 Zip 	 ster 	 	.
The	 car 	 s 	 	they	 pick 	 ed 	 	did	n't	look	like	 ex 	 - 	 cop 	 	 car 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 hollow 	 ed 	 	out	or	 some 	 thing 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	 pick 	 ed 	 	these	sexy	 car 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	 target 	 ed 	 	to	 un 	 ive 	 rs 	 ities 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	made	 s 	 ure 	 	that	the	 demo 	 graphic 	 	for	who	they	 we 	 re 	 	 target 	 ing 	 	and	the	car	was	all	 match 	 ing 	 	.
It	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	nice	experience	,	and	the	 car 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	clean	and	 reli 	 able 	 	,	and	it	all	 work 	 ed 	 	.
And	so	from	a	 brand 	 ing 	 	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	they	got	a	lot	right	.
But	they	 under 	 stood 	 	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	that	they	are	not	a	car	company	.
 The 	 y 	 	understand	that	they	are	an	information	company	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	when	we	buy	a	car	we	go	to	the	 deal 	 er 	 	once	,	we	have	an	 interact 	 ion 	 	,	and	we	're	 ch 	 ow 	 	--	 usual 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	possible	.
But	when	you	're	sharing	a	car	and	you	have	a	 car 	 - 	 share 	 	service	,	you	might	use	an	 E. 	 V 	 	.	to	commute	,	you	get	a	truck	 be 	 cause 	 	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	a	home	project	.
When	you	pick	your	aunt	up	at	the	 air 	 port 	 	,	you	get	a	 s 	 ed 	 an 	 	.
And	you	're	going	to	the	 mountain 	 s 	 	to	ski	,	you	get	different	 access 	 ories 	 	put	on	the	car	for	 do 	 ing 	 	that	sort	of	thing	.
 Mean 	 while 	 	,	these	 guy 	 s 	 	are	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	back	,	 collect 	 ing 	 	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	data	about	our	behavior	and	how	we	interact	with	the	service	.
And	so	it	's	not	 on 	 ly 	 	an	option	for	them	,	but	I	 believ 	 e 	 	it	's	an	 imper 	 ative 	 	for	 Zip 	 car 	 	and	other	mesh	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	just	 w 	 ow 	 	us	,	to	be	like	a	 con 	 cierge 	 	service	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	we	give	them	so	much	information	,	and	they	are	 en 	 titled 	 	to	 re 	 ally 	 	see	how	it	is	that	we	're	moving	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	in	 re 	 ally 	 	good	shape	to	 anticip 	 ate 	 	what	we	're	going	to	want	next	.
And	so	what	percent	of	the	day	do	you	think	the	average	person	uses	a	car	?
What	 percent 	 age 	 	of	the	time	?
Any	 guess 	 es 	 	?
 T 	 hose 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	good	.
I	was	 imagin 	 ing 	 	it	was	like	20	percent	when	I	first	 start 	 ed 	 	.
The	number	 a 	 cross 	 	the	U.S.	and	Western	 Euro 	 pe 	 	is	eight	percent	.
And	so	 bas 	 ically 	 	even	if	you	think	it	's	10	percent	,	90	percent	of	the	time	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 cost 	 s 	 	us	a	lot	of	money	--	 personal 	 ly 	 	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	we	organize	our	cities	around	it	and	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	--	90	percent	of	the	time	it	's	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	around	.
So	for	 th 	 is 	 	reason	,	I	think	one	of	the	other	 theme 	 s 	 	with	the	mesh	is	 essential 	 ly 	 	that	,	if	we	 squeez 	 e 	 	hard	on	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	've	 throw 	 n 	 	away	,	there	's	a	lot	of	value	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
What	set	up	with	 Zip 	 car 	 	--	 Zip 	 car 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	in	2000	.
In	the	last	year	,	2010	,	two	car	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	,	one	that	's	in	the	 U. 	 K. 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 W 	 hip 	 Car 	 	,	and	the	other	one	,	 Re 	 lay 	 Ride 	 s 	 	,	in	the	 U. 	 S 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	both	 peer 	 - 	 to 	 - 	 peer 	 	 car 	 - 	 sharing 	 	 service 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	two	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	work	for	 car 	 - 	 sharing 	 	is	,	one	,	the	car	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	 avail 	 able 	 	,	and	two	,	it	's	 with 	 in 	 	one	or	two	 block 	 s 	 	of	where	you	stand	.
Well	the	car	that	's	one	or	two	 block 	 s 	 	from	your	home	or	your	 off 	 ice 	 	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	your	neighbor	's	car	,	and	it	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	.
So	people	have	 create 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	business	.
 Zip 	 car 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	a	decade	 ear 	 lier 	 	,	in	2000	.
It	took	them	six	 year 	 s 	 	to	get	1,000	 car 	 s 	 	in	service	.
 W 	 hip 	 Car 	 	,	which	 start 	 ed 	 	April	of	last	year	,	it	took	them	six	 month 	 s 	 	to	get	1,000	 car 	 s 	 	in	the	service	.
So	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
People	are	making	 any 	 where 	 	between	200	and	700	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	month	 lett 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 neighbor 	 s 	 	use	 the 	 ir 	 	car	when	they	're	not	using	it	.
So	it	's	like	 vac 	 ation 	 	 rent 	 al 	 s 	 	for	 car 	 s 	 	.
Since	I	'm	here	--	and	I	hope	some	people	in	the	audience	are	in	the	car	business	--	--	I	'm	 think 	 ing 	 	that	,	coming	from	the	technology	side	of	 thing 	 s 	 	--	we	saw	 cable 	 - 	 ready 	 	 TV 	 s 	 	and	 Wi 	 Fi 	 - 	 ready 	 	 Not 	 e 	 book 	 s 	 	--	it	would	be	 re 	 ally 	 	great	if	,	any	minute	now	,	you	 guy 	 s 	 	could	start	 roll 	 ing 	 	 share 	 - 	 ready 	 	 car 	 s 	 	off	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	it	just	 create 	 s 	 	more	 flex 	 ibility 	 	.
It	 allow 	 s 	 	us	 a 	 s 	 	 owner 	 s 	 	to	have	other	 option 	 s 	 	.
And	I	think	we	're	going	there	 any 	 way 	 	.
The	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	and	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	with	mesh	 business 	 es 	 	--	and	 t 	 hose 	 	are	 business 	 es 	 	like	 Zip 	 car 	 	or	Netflix	that	are	full	mesh	 business 	 es 	 	,	or	other	 one 	 s 	 	where	you	have	a	lot	of	the	car	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	,	car	 manufactur 	 ers 	 	,	who	are	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	 off 	 er 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 car 	 - 	 share 	 	 service 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	a	second	 flan 	 ker 	 	brand	,	or	 a 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	a	test	,	I	think	--	is	to	make	sharing	 ir 	 resist 	 ible 	 	.
We	have	 experience 	 s 	 	in	our	 live 	 s 	 	,	 certain 	 ly 	 	,	when	sharing	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 ir 	 resist 	 ible 	 	.
It	's	just	,	how	do	we	make	that	 re 	 current 	 	and	scale	it	?
We	know	 al 	 so 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	 connect 	 ed 	 	in	social	 network 	 s 	 	,	that	it	's	easy	to	create	 de 	 light 	 	in	one	little	place	.
It	's	 con 	 tag 	 ious 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	all	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	each	other	.
So	if	I	have	a	 terr 	 ific 	 	experience	and	I	tweet	it	,	or	I	tell	five	people	 stand 	 ing 	 	next	to	me	,	news	 travel 	 s 	 	.
The	 oppos 	 ite 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	know	,	is	 al 	 so 	 	true	,	often	more	true	.
So	here	we	have	 Lu 	 do 	 T 	 ruck 	 	,	which	is	in	 L. 	 A. 	 	,	 do 	 ing 	 	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	gourmet	food	 truck 	 s 	 	do	,	and	they	've	 gather 	 ed 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	a	 follow 	 ing 	 	.
In	general	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	I	'm	a	tech	entrepreneur	,	I	look	at	 thing 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 platform 	 s 	 	.
 Platform 	 s 	 	are	 invit 	 ations 	 	.
So	creating	 Craig 	 s 	 list 	 	or	 i 	 Tunes 	 	and	the	 i 	 Phone 	 	 develop 	 er 	 	network	,	there	are	all	these	 network 	 s 	 	--	Facebook	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	 platform 	 s 	 	 invit 	 e 	 	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 develop 	 ers 	 	and	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	people	to	come	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	create	and	target	an	application	for	a	 part 	 icular 	 	audience	.
And	 honest 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	full	of	 surprise 	 s 	 	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	I	do	n't	think	any	of	us	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	could	have	 predict 	 ed 	 	the	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 application 	 s 	 	that	have	 happen 	 ed 	 	at	Facebook	,	around	Facebook	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	when	Mark	 announce 	 d 	 	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	go	with	a	platform	.
So	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	,	I	think	that	cities	are	 platform 	 s 	 	,	and	 certain 	 ly 	 	 De 	 tro 	 it 	 	is	a	platform	.
The	 invit 	 ation 	 	of	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	makers	and	 artist 	 s 	 	and	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	--	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 help 	 s 	 	 stimul 	 ate 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 fi 	 ery 	 	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	and	 help 	 s 	 	a	city	to	 thriv 	 e 	 	.
It	's	 invit 	 ing 	 	 particip 	 ation 	 	,	and	cities	have	,	 historic 	 ally 	 	,	 invit 	 ed 	 	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 particip 	 ation 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	we	're	 say 	 ing 	 	that	there	's	other	 option 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
So	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	city	 depart 	 ments 	 	can	open	up	transit	data	.
Google	 ha 	 s 	 	made	 avail 	 able 	 	transit	data	 A 	 PI 	 	.
And	so	there	's	about	seven	or	eight	cities	 al 	 ready 	 	in	the	 U. 	 S 	 	.
that	have	 provide 	 d 	 	the	transit	data	,	and	different	 develop 	 ers 	 	are	building	 application 	 s 	 	.
So	I	was	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	coffee	in	 Port 	 land 	 	,	and	 half 	 - 	 of 	 - 	 a 	 - 	 latte 	 	in	and	the	little	board	in	the	cafe	all	of	a	sudden	 start 	 s 	 	 show 	 ing 	 	me	that	the	next	bus	is	coming	in	three	 minute 	 s 	 	and	the	train	is	coming	in	16	 minute 	 s 	 	.
And	so	it	's	 reli 	 able 	 	,	real	data	that	's	right	in	my	face	,	where	I	am	,	so	I	can	finish	the	latte	.
There	's	 th 	 is 	 	fabulous	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	we	have	 a 	 cross 	 	the	U.S.	now	:	about	21	percent	of	 vac 	 ant 	 	commercial	and	industrial	space	.
That	space	is	not	vital	.
The	 area 	 s 	 	around	it	lack	 vital 	 ity 	 	and	 vib 	 r 	 ancy 	 	and	 engage 	 ment 	 	.
There	's	 th 	 is 	 	thing	--	how	 man 	 y 	 	people	here	have	heard	of	 pop 	 - 	 up 	 	 store 	 s 	 	or	 pop 	 - 	 up 	 	 shop 	 s 	 	?
Oh	,	great	.	So	I	'm	a	big	fan	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 mesh 	 - 	 y 	 	thing	.
 Essential 	 ly 	 	,	there	are	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 restaurant 	 s 	 	in	 Oak 	 land 	 	,	near	where	I	live	.
There	's	a	 pop 	 - 	 up 	 	general	store	every	three	 week 	 s 	 	,	and	they	do	a	fantastic	job	of	making	a	 ver 	 y 	 	social	event	 happen 	 ing 	 	for	 food 	 ies 	 	.
Super	 f 	 un 	 	,	and	it	 happen 	 s 	 	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 transit 	 ional 	 	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	.
 Sub 	 sequent 	 	to	that	,	after	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	going	for	about	a	year	now	,	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	to	lease	and	create	and	extend	.
An	area	that	was	 ed 	 gy 	 - 	 art 	 s 	 y 	 	is	now	 start 	 ing 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	much	 cool 	 er 	 	and	engage	a	lot	more	people	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
The	Crafty	 Fo 	 x 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	woman	who	's	 in 	 to 	 	 craft 	 s 	 	,	and	she	 do 	 es 	 	these	 pop 	 - 	 up 	 	 craft 	 s 	 	 fair 	 s 	 	around	London	.
But	these	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	 man 	 y 	 	different	 environment 	 s 	 	.
From	my	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	 pop 	 - 	 up 	 	 store 	 s 	 	do	is	create	 perish 	 ability 	 	and	 urge 	 ncy 	 	.
It	 create 	 s 	 	two	of	the	 favor 	 ite 	 	 word 	 s 	 	of	any	 business 	 person 	 	:	 s 	 old 	 	out	.
And	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	 re 	 ally 	 	focus	trust	and	attention	is	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	thing	.
So	a	lot	of	what	we	see	in	the	mesh	,	and	a	lot	of	what	we	have	in	the	platform	that	we	built	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	define	,	refine	and	scale	.
It	 allow 	 s 	 	us	to	test	 thing 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	entrepreneur	,	to	go	to	market	,	to	be	in	conversation	with	people	,	listen	,	refine	 some 	 thing 	 	and	go	back	.
It	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 cost 	 - 	 effective 	 	,	and	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 mesh 	 - 	 y 	 	.
The	 infra 	 structure 	 	 en 	 able 	 s 	 	that	.
In	 clo 	 s 	 ing 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	we	're	moving	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	the	end	,	I	just	 al 	 so 	 	want	to	 encourag 	 e 	 	--	and	I	'm	 will 	 ing 	 	to	share	my	 failure 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	 th 	 ough 	 	not	from	the	stage	.
I	would	just	like	to	say	that	one	of	the	big	 thing 	 s 	 	,	when	we	look	at	waste	and	when	we	look	at	ways	that	we	can	 re 	 ally 	 	be	 gen 	 er 	 ous 	 	and	 con 	 tribute 	 	to	each	other	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	move	to	create	a	better	economic	 situ 	 ation 	 	and	a	better	 environment 	 al 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	,	is	by	sharing	 failure 	 s 	 	.
And	one	quick	 ex 	 ample 	 	is	 Ve 	 lib 	 	,	in	2007	,	came	forward	in	Paris	with	a	 ver 	 y 	 	bold	 pro 	 position 	 	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	big	 bike 	 - 	 sharing 	 	service	.
 The 	 y 	 	made	a	lot	of	 mistak 	 es 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	had	some	number	of	big	 success 	 es 	 	.
But	they	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 trans 	 parent 	 	,	or	they	had	to	be	,	in	the	way	that	they	 expo 	 s 	 ed 	 	what	 work 	 ed 	 	and	did	n't	work	.
And	so	 B. 	 C 	 	.	in	 Bar 	 celona 	 	and	 B 	 - 	 cycle 	 	and	 Bo 	 ris 	 	 Bike 	 s 	 	in	London	--	no	one	 ha 	 s 	 	had	to	repeat	the	version	1.0	 screw 	 - 	 up 	 s 	 	and	expensive	 learn 	 ing 	 	 exercis 	 es 	 	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	Paris	.
So	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	when	we	're	 connect 	 ed 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	to	share	 failure 	 s 	 	and	 success 	 es 	 	.
We	're	at	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	 some 	 thing 	 	that	,	what	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	and	the	way	that	mesh	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	are	coming	forward	,	is	 invit 	 ing 	 	,	it	's	 engag 	 ing 	 	,	but	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	early	.
I	have	a	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	--	it	's	a	 director 	 y 	 	--	and	it	 start 	 ed 	 	with	about	1,200	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	,	and	in	the	last	 two 	 - 	 and 	 - 	 a 	 - 	 half 	 	 month 	 s 	 	it	's	up	to	about	3,300	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	.
And	it	 grow 	 s 	 	on	a	 ver 	 y 	 	regular	 dai 	 ly 	 	 bas 	 is 	 	.
But	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	much	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	.
So	I	just	want	to	welcome	all	of	you	onto	the	ride	.
And	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.

So	I	 call 	 ed 	 	back	and	I	told	her	,	``	Look	,	Amy	,	tell	the	TED	 guy 	 s 	 	I	just	wo	n't	show	up	.
I	ca	n't	do	 any 	 thing 	 	to	 s 	 ave 	 	the	world	.	''
She	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Hey	,	 J 	 R 	 	,	your	wish	is	not	to	 s 	 ave 	 	the	world	,	but	to	change	the	world	.	''
``	Oh	,	all	right	.	''
``	That	's	cool	.	''
I	mean	,	technology	,	 politic 	 s 	 	,	business	do	change	the	world	--	not	 al 	 ways 	 	in	a	good	way	,	but	they	do	.
What	about	art	?
 Cou 	 ld 	 	art	change	the	world	?
I	 start 	 ed 	 	when	I	was	15	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
And	at	that	time	,	I	was	not	 think 	 ing 	 	about	changing	the	world	.
I	was	 do 	 ing 	 	graffiti	--	writing	my	name	 every 	 where 	 	,	using	the	city	 a 	 s 	 	a	canvas	.
I	was	going	in	the	 tunnel 	 s 	 	of	Paris	,	on	the	 roof 	 top 	 s 	 	with	my	 friend 	 s 	 	.
 E 	 ach 	 	trip	was	an	 ex 	 cur 	 s 	 ion 	 	,	was	an	adventure	.
It	was	like	 leav 	 ing 	 	our	mark	on	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	to	say	,	``	I	was	here	,	''	on	the	top	of	a	building	.
So	when	I	found	a	cheap	camera	on	the	 sub 	 way 	 	,	I	 start 	 ed 	 	 document 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 adventure 	 s 	 	with	my	 friend 	 s 	 	and	 g 	 ave 	 	them	back	 a 	 s 	 	 photo 	 copies 	 	--	 re 	 ally 	 	small	 photo 	 s 	 	just	that	 s 	 ize 	 	.
That	's	how	,	at	17	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	I	 start 	 ed 	 	 past 	 ing 	 	them	.
And	I	did	my	first	``	expo	de	 ru 	 e 	 	,	''	which	 mean 	 s 	 	 side 	 walk 	 	 gall 	 ery 	 	.
And	I	 frame 	 d 	 	it	with	color	so	you	would	not	 con 	 fuse 	 	it	with	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	.
I	mean	,	the	city	's	the	best	 gall 	 ery 	 	I	could	imagine	.
I	would	never	have	to	make	a	book	and	then	present	it	to	a	 gall 	 ery 	 	and	let	them	decide	if	my	work	was	nice	 en 	 ough 	 	to	show	it	to	people	.
I	would	control	it	 direct 	 ly 	 	with	the	public	in	the	 street 	 s 	 	.
So	that	's	Paris	.
I	would	change	--	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	the	 place 	 s 	 	I	would	go	--	the	title	of	the	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	.
That	's	on	the	 Champ 	 s 	 - 	 Elys 	 ees 	 	.
I	was	 quit 	 e 	 	proud	of	that	one	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	I	was	just	18	and	I	was	just	up	there	on	the	top	of	the	 Champ 	 s 	 - 	 Elys 	 ees 	 	.
 Th 	 en 	 	when	the	photo	left	,	the	frame	was	still	there	.
 Nove 	 mb 	 er 	 	2005	:	the	 street 	 s 	 	are	 burn 	 ing 	 	.
A	large	wave	of	 riot 	 s 	 	had	broken	 in 	 to 	 	the	first	 project 	 s 	 	of	Paris	.
 Every 	 one 	 	was	 glu 	 ed 	 	to	the	TV	,	 watch 	 ing 	 	 disturb 	 ing 	 	,	 frighten 	 ing 	 	 image 	 s 	 	taken	from	the	edge	of	the	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	.
I	mean	,	these	 kid 	 s 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	control	,	 throw 	 ing 	 	Molotov	 cock 	 tail 	 s 	 	,	 attack 	 ing 	 	the	 cop 	 s 	 	and	the	 fire 	 men 	 	,	 loot 	 ing 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	they	could	in	the	 shop 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 criminal 	 s 	 	,	 crook 	 s 	 	,	 danger 	 ous 	 	,	 pur 	 suing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	environment	.
And	then	I	saw	it	--	could	it	be	possible	?	--	my	photo	on	a	wall	 reveal 	 ed 	 	by	a	 burn 	 ing 	 	car	--	a	 past 	 ing 	 	I	'd	 d 	 one 	 	a	year	 ear 	 lier 	 	--	an	 il 	 legal 	 	one	--	still	there	.
I	mean	,	these	 we 	 re 	 	the	 face 	 s 	 	of	my	 friend 	 s 	 	.
I	know	 t 	 hose 	 	 guy 	 s 	 	.
All	of	them	are	not	 angel 	 s 	 	,	but	they	're	not	 mon 	 sters 	 	either	.
So	it	was	kind	of	weird	to	see	 t 	 hose 	 	 image 	 s 	 	and	 t 	 hose 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	 star 	 e 	 	back	at	me	through	a	 tele 	 vision 	 	.
So	I	went	back	there	with	a	28	mm	lens	.
It	was	the	 on 	 ly 	 	one	I	had	at	that	time	.
But	with	that	lens	,	you	have	to	be	 a 	 s 	 	close	 a 	 s 	 	10	 inch 	 es 	 	from	the	person	.
So	you	can	do	it	 on 	 ly 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	trust	.
So	I	took	four	 portrait 	 s 	 	of	people	from	Le	 Bo 	 squet 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	 we 	 re 	 	making	 scar 	 y 	 	 face 	 s 	 	to	play	the	 caricatur 	 e 	 	of	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
And	then	I	 past 	 ed 	 	huge	 post 	 ers 	 	 every 	 where 	 	in	the	bourgeois	area	of	Paris	with	the	name	,	age	,	even	building	number	of	these	 guy 	 s 	 	.
A	year	 lat 	 er 	 	,	the	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	was	 dis 	 play 	 ed 	 	in	front	of	the	city	hall	of	Paris	.
And	we	go	from	took	 image 	 s 	 	,	who	've	 be 	 en 	 	 stole 	 n 	 	and	 distort 	 ed 	 	by	the	media	,	who	's	now	 proud 	 ly 	 	taking	over	his	own	image	.
That	's	where	I	 real 	 ized 	 	the	power	of	paper	and	glue	.
So	could	art	change	the	world	?
A	year	 lat 	 er 	 	,	I	was	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	all	the	noise	about	the	Middle	East	conflict	.
I	mean	,	at	that	time	,	trust	me	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	 refer 	 ring 	 	to	the	Israeli	and	Palestinian	conflict	.
So	with	my	friend	 Mar 	 co 	 	,	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	go	there	and	see	who	are	the	real	 Palestinian 	 s 	 	and	who	are	the	real	 Israeli 	 s 	 	.
 A 	 re 	 	they	so	different	?
When	we	got	there	,	we	just	went	in	the	street	,	 start 	 ed 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	with	people	 every 	 where 	 	,	and	we	 real 	 ized 	 	that	 thing 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	a	bit	different	from	the	rhetoric	we	heard	in	the	media	.
So	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	take	 portrait 	 s 	 	of	 Palestinian 	 s 	 	and	 Israeli 	 s 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	the	same	 job 	 s 	 	--	 taxi 	 - 	 driver 	 	,	lawyer	,	 cook 	 s 	 	.
 Ask 	 ed 	 	them	to	make	a	face	 a 	 s 	 	a	sign	of	 commit 	 ment 	 	.
Not	a	 s 	 mile 	 	--	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	tell	about	who	you	are	and	what	you	feel	.
 The 	 y 	 	all	 accept 	 ed 	 	to	be	 past 	 ed 	 	next	to	the	other	.
I	 decide 	 d 	 	to	paste	in	eight	Israeli	and	Palestinian	cities	and	on	both	 side 	 s 	 	of	the	wall	.
We	 launch 	 ed 	 	the	 big 	 gest 	 	 il 	 legal 	 	art	 exhibit 	 ion 	 	ever	.
We	 call 	 ed 	 	the	project	Face	2	Face	.
The	 expert 	 s 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	No	way	.
The	people	will	not	accept	.
The	 arm 	 y 	 	will	shoot	you	,	and	 Ham 	 a 	 s 	 	will	kidnap	you	.	''
We	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 Oka 	 y 	 	,	let	's	try	and	push	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	we	can	.	''
I	love	the	way	that	people	will	ask	me	,	``	How	big	will	my	photo	be	?	''
``	It	will	be	 a 	 s 	 	big	 a 	 s 	 	your	house	.	''
When	we	did	the	wall	,	we	did	the	Palestinian	side	.
So	we	 arriv 	 ed 	 	with	just	our	 lad 	 d 	 ers 	 	and	we	 real 	 ized 	 	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	not	high	 en 	 ough 	 	.
And	so	 Palestinian 	 s 	 	 guy 	 s 	 	say	,	``	Calm	down	.	No	wait	.	I	'm	going	to	find	you	a	solution	.	''
So	he	went	to	the	Church	of	 Nat 	 ivity 	 	and	 br 	 ought 	 	back	an	old	 lad 	 der 	 	that	was	so	old	that	it	could	have	 s 	 een 	 	 Je 	 s 	 us 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	born	.
We	did	Face	2	Face	with	 on 	 ly 	 	six	 friend 	 s 	 	,	two	 lad 	 d 	 ers 	 	,	two	 brush 	 es 	 	,	a	 rent 	 ed 	 	car	,	a	camera	and	20,000	square	feet	of	paper	.
We	had	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	help	from	all	 walk 	 s 	 	of	life	.
 Oka 	 y 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	that	's	Palestine	.
We	're	in	 Rama 	 llah 	 	right	now	.
We	're	 past 	 ing 	 	 portrait 	 s 	 	--	so	both	 portrait 	 s 	 	in	the	 street 	 s 	 	in	a	 crowd 	 ed 	 	market	.
People	come	around	us	and	start	 ask 	 ing 	 	,	``	What	are	you	 do 	 ing 	 	here	?	''
``	Oh	,	we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	an	art	project	and	we	are	placing	an	Israeli	and	a	Palestinian	 do 	 ing 	 	the	same	job	.
And	 t 	 hose 	 	 one 	 s 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	two	 taxi 	 - 	 driver 	 s 	 	.	''
And	then	there	was	 al 	 ways 	 	a	silence	.
``	You	mean	you	're	 past 	 ing 	 	an	Israeli	face	--	 do 	 ing 	 	a	face	--	right	here	?	''
``	Well	,	 yea 	 h 	 	,	 yea 	 h 	 	,	that	's	part	of	the	project	.	''
And	I	would	 al 	 ways 	 	 leav 	 e 	 	that	moment	,	and	we	would	ask	them	,	``	So	can	you	tell	me	who	is	who	?	''
And	most	of	them	could	n't	say	.
We	even	 past 	 ed 	 	on	Israeli	 militar 	 y 	 	 tower 	 s 	 	,	and	 noth 	 ing 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
When	you	paste	an	image	,	it	's	just	paper	and	glue	.
People	can	tear	it	,	tag	on	it	,	or	even	 pe 	 e 	 	on	it	--	some	are	a	bit	high	for	that	,	I	agree	--	but	the	people	in	the	street	,	they	are	the	 cur 	 ator 	 	.
The	rain	and	the	wind	will	take	them	off	 any 	 way 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	are	not	 me 	 ant 	 	to	stay	.
But	 exact 	 ly 	 	four	 year 	 s 	 	after	,	the	 photo 	 s 	 	,	most	of	them	are	still	there	.
Face	2	Face	 demonst 	 rated 	 	that	what	we	thought	 im 	 possible 	 	was	possible	--	and	,	you	know	what	,	even	easy	.
We	did	n't	push	the	limit	;	we	just	 show 	 ed 	 	that	they	 we 	 re 	 	further	than	 any 	 one 	 	thought	.
In	the	Middle	East	,	I	 experience 	 d 	 	my	work	in	 place 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	[	 man 	 y 	 	]	 museum 	 s 	 	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	direction	in	the	street	 we 	 re 	 	kind	of	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
So	I	 decide 	 d 	 	to	go	further	in	 th 	 is 	 	direction	and	go	in	 place 	 s 	 	where	there	 we 	 re 	 	zero	 museum 	 s 	 	.
When	you	go	in	these	 develop 	 ing 	 	 socie 	 ties 	 	,	women	are	the	 pillar 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	community	,	but	the	men	are	still	the	 one 	 s 	 	 hold 	 ing 	 	the	 street 	 s 	 	.
So	we	 we 	 re 	 	inspired	to	create	a	project	where	men	will	pay	tribute	to	women	by	 post 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 photo 	 s 	 	.
I	 call 	 ed 	 	that	project	Women	 A 	 re 	 	 Hero 	 es 	 	.
When	I	 listen 	 ed 	 	to	all	the	 st 	 ories 	 	 every 	 where 	 	I	went	on	the	 continent 	 s 	 	,	I	could	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	understand	the	 complic 	 ated 	 	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	conflict	.
I	just	 observ 	 ed 	 	.
 Some 	 time 	 s 	 	there	was	no	 word 	 s 	 	,	no	sentence	,	just	 tear 	 s 	 	.
I	just	took	 the 	 ir 	 	 picture 	 s 	 	and	 past 	 ed 	 	them	.
Women	 A 	 re 	 	 Hero 	 es 	 	took	me	around	the	world	.
 Mo 	 st 	 	of	the	 place 	 s 	 	I	went	to	,	I	 decide 	 d 	 	to	go	there	 be 	 cause 	 	I	've	heard	about	it	through	the	media	.
So	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	in	 Ju 	 ne 	 	2008	,	I	was	 watch 	 ing 	 	TV	in	Paris	,	and	then	I	heard	about	 th 	 is 	 	 terr 	 ible 	 	thing	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	 Ri 	 o 	 	de	 Jane 	 ir 	 o 	 	--	the	first	favela	of	Brazil	named	 Provid 	 en 	 cia 	 	.
Three	 kid 	 s 	 	--	that	was	three	 student 	 s 	 	--	 we 	 re 	 	[	 de 	 tain 	 ed 	 	]	by	the	 arm 	 y 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	not	 carry 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 paper 	 s 	 	.
And	the	 arm 	 y 	 	took	them	,	and	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	them	to	the	police	station	,	they	 br 	 ought 	 	them	to	an	 ene 	 my 	 	favela	where	they	get	 chop 	 ped 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 piece 	 s 	 	.
I	was	 shock 	 ed 	 	.
All	Brazil	was	 shock 	 ed 	 	.
I	heard	it	was	one	of	the	most	violent	 favela 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	largest	drug	 cart 	 el 	 	 control 	 s 	 	it	.
So	I	 decide 	 d 	 	to	go	there	.
When	I	 arriv 	 ed 	 	--	I	mean	,	I	did	n't	have	any	contact	with	any	 NG 	 O 	 	.
There	was	 non 	 e 	 	in	place	--	no	tourist	agent	,	no	 NG 	 O 	 s 	 	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	--	So	we	just	 walk 	 ed 	 	around	,	and	we	met	a	woman	,	and	I	 show 	 ed 	 	her	my	book	.
And	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	You	know	what	?
We	're	 hung 	 ry 	 	for	culture	.
We	need	culture	out	there	.	''
So	I	went	out	and	I	 start 	 ed 	 	with	the	 kid 	 s 	 	.
I	just	took	a	few	 photo 	 s 	 	of	the	 kid 	 s 	 	,	and	the	next	day	I	came	with	the	 post 	 ers 	 	and	we	 past 	 ed 	 	them	.
The	day	after	,	I	came	back	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	 scratch 	 ed 	 	.
But	that	's	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	.
I	 want 	 ed 	 	them	to	feel	that	 th 	 is 	 	art	 belong 	 s 	 	to	them	.
 Th 	 en 	 	the	next	day	,	I	held	a	 meet 	 ing 	 	on	the	main	square	and	some	women	came	.
 The 	 y 	 	 we 	 re 	 	all	linked	to	the	three	 kid 	 s 	 	that	got	 kill 	 ed 	 	.
There	was	the	mother	,	the	 grand 	 mother 	 	,	the	best	friend	--	they	all	 want 	 ed 	 	to	shout	the	story	.
After	that	day	,	 every 	 one 	 	in	the	favela	 g 	 ave 	 	me	the	green	light	.
I	took	more	 photo 	 s 	 	,	and	we	 start 	 ed 	 	the	project	.
The	drug	 lord 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	kind	of	 worri 	 ed 	 	about	us	 film 	 ing 	 	in	the	place	,	so	I	told	them	,	``	You	know	what	?
I	'm	not	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 film 	 ing 	 	the	violence	and	the	 weapon 	 s 	 	.
You	see	that	 en 	 ough 	 	in	the	media	.
What	I	want	to	show	is	the	 in 	 credible 	 	life	.
And	 actual 	 ly 	 	I	've	 be 	 en 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	it	around	me	the	last	few	 day 	 s 	 	.	''
So	that	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 symbol 	 ic 	 	 past 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	the	first	one	we	did	that	you	could	n't	see	from	the	city	.
And	that	's	where	the	three	 kid 	 s 	 	got	 arrest 	 ed 	 	,	and	that	's	the	 grand 	 mother 	 	of	one	of	them	.
And	on	that	 stair 	 s 	 	,	that	's	where	the	 traffic 	 ker 	 s 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	stand	and	there	's	a	lot	of	 ex 	 change 	 	of	fire	.
 Every 	 one 	 	there	 under 	 stood 	 	the	project	.
And	then	we	 past 	 ed 	 	 every 	 where 	 	--	the	whole	hill	.
What	was	 interest 	 ing 	 	is	that	the	media	could	n't	get	in	.
I	mean	,	you	should	see	that	.
 The 	 y 	 	would	have	to	film	us	from	a	 re 	 ally 	 	long	distance	by	helicopter	and	then	have	a	 re 	 ally 	 	long	lens	,	and	we	would	see	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	on	TV	,	 past 	 ing 	 	.
And	they	would	put	a	number	:	``	 P 	 lease 	 	call	 th 	 is 	 	number	if	you	know	what	's	going	on	in	 Provid 	 en 	 cia 	 	.	''
We	just	did	a	project	and	then	left	so	the	media	would	n't	know	.
So	how	can	we	know	about	the	project	?
So	they	had	to	go	and	find	the	women	and	get	an	 explan 	 ation 	 	from	them	.
So	you	create	a	bridge	between	the	media	and	the	 anonym 	 ous 	 	women	.
We	 ke 	 pt 	 	 travel 	 ing 	 	.
We	went	to	 Afri 	 ca 	 	,	 Sud 	 an 	 	,	Sierra	 Leon 	 e 	 	,	In	 war 	 - 	 torn 	 	 place 	 s 	 	like	 Mon 	 ro 	 via 	 	,	people	come	straight	to	you	.
I	mean	,	they	want	to	know	what	you	're	up	to	.
 The 	 y 	 	 ke 	 pt 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	me	,	``	What	is	the	purpose	of	your	project	?
 A 	 re 	 	you	an	 NG 	 O 	 	?	 A 	 re 	 	you	the	media	?	''
Art	.	Just	 do 	 ing 	 	art	.
Some	people	question	,	``	Why	is	it	in	black	and	white	?
Do	n't	you	have	color	in	 Franc 	 e 	 	?	''
Or	they	tell	you	,	``	 A 	 re 	 	these	people	all	dead	?	''
Some	who	 under 	 stood 	 	the	project	would	explain	it	to	 other 	 s 	 	.
And	to	a	man	who	did	not	understand	,	I	heard	 some 	 one 	 	say	,	``	You	know	,	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	here	for	a	few	 hour 	 s 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	,	 discuss 	 ing 	 	with	your	 fellow 	 s 	 	.
 Dur 	 ing 	 	that	time	,	you	have	n't	thought	about	what	you	're	going	to	eat	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	art	.	''
I	think	it	's	people	's	curiosity	that	 motiv 	 ates 	 	them	to	come	 in 	 to 	 	the	 project 	 s 	 	.
And	then	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	more	.
It	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	 desir 	 e 	 	,	a	need	,	an	 arm 	 or 	 	.
On	 th 	 is 	 	bridge	that	's	in	 Mon 	 ro 	 via 	 	,	an	 ex 	 - 	 rebel 	 	soldier	 help 	 ed 	 	us	 past 	 ing 	 	a	portrait	of	a	woman	that	might	have	 be 	 en 	 	 rap 	 ed 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	war	.
Women	are	 al 	 ways 	 	the	first	 one 	 s 	 	 target 	 ed 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	conflict	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	Kibera	,	Kenya	,	one	of	the	largest	 s 	 lum 	 s 	 	of	 Afri 	 ca 	 	.
You	might	have	 s 	 een 	 	 image 	 s 	 	about	the	 post 	 - 	 election 	 	violence	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	there	in	2008	.
 Th 	 is 	 	time	we	 cover 	 ed 	 	the	 roof 	 s 	 	of	the	 house 	 s 	 	,	but	we	did	n't	use	paper	,	 be 	 cause 	 	paper	 do 	 es 	 	n't	prevent	the	rain	from	 leak 	 ing 	 	 in 	 side 	 	the	house	--	vinyl	 do 	 es 	 	.
 Th 	 en 	 	art	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	.
So	the	people	 ke 	 pt 	 	it	.
You	know	what	I	love	is	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	when	you	see	the	 big 	 gest 	 	eye	there	,	there	are	so	[	 man 	 y 	 	]	 house 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	.
And	I	went	there	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	ago	--	 photo 	 s 	 	are	still	there	--	and	it	was	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	a	piece	of	the	eye	.
So	I	 ask 	 ed 	 	the	people	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
``	Oh	,	that	guy	just	 move 	 d 	 	.	''
When	the	 roof 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 cover 	 ed 	 	,	a	woman	 s 	 aid 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	joke	,	``	 N 	 ow 	 	God	can	see	me	.	''
When	you	look	at	Kibera	now	,	they	look	back	.
 Oka 	 y 	 	,	India	.
 Be 	 fore 	 	I	start	that	,	just	so	you	know	,	each	time	we	go	to	a	place	,	we	do	n't	have	a	tourist	agent	,	so	we	set	up	like	 command 	 os 	 	--	we	're	a	group	of	 friend 	 s 	 	who	 arriv 	 e 	 	there	,	and	we	try	to	paste	on	the	 wall 	 s 	 	.
But	there	are	 place 	 s 	 	where	you	just	ca	n't	paste	on	a	wall	.
In	India	it	was	just	 im 	 possible 	 	to	paste	.
I	heard	 cultural 	 ly 	 	and	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	law	,	they	would	just	arrest	us	at	the	first	 past 	 ing 	 	.
So	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	paste	white	,	white	on	the	 wall 	 s 	 	.
So	imagine	white	 guy 	 s 	 	 past 	 ing 	 	white	 paper 	 s 	 	.
So	people	would	come	to	us	and	ask	us	,	``	Hey	,	what	are	you	up	to	?	''
``	Oh	,	you	know	,	we	're	just	 do 	 ing 	 	art	.	''	``	Art	?	''
Of	course	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	 con 	 fused 	 	.
But	you	know	how	India	 ha 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	dust	in	the	 street 	 s 	 	,	and	the	more	dust	you	would	have	going	up	in	the	air	,	on	the	white	paper	you	can	 al 	 most 	 	see	,	but	there	is	 th 	 is 	 	 stick 	 y 	 	part	like	when	you	reverse	a	 stick 	 er 	 	.
So	the	more	dust	you	have	,	the	more	it	will	reveal	the	photo	.
So	we	could	just	walk	in	the	street	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	next	 day 	 s 	 	and	the	 photo 	 s 	 	would	get	 reveal 	 ed 	 	by	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
Thank	you	.
So	we	did	n't	get	caught	 th 	 is 	 	time	.
 E 	 ach 	 	project	--	that	's	a	film	from	Women	 A 	 re 	 	 Hero 	 es 	 	.
 Oka 	 y 	 	.
For	each	project	we	do	a	film	.
And	most	of	what	you	see	--	that	's	a	 trail 	 er 	 	from	``	Women	 A 	 re 	 	 Hero 	 es 	 	''	--	 it 	 s 	 	 image 	 s 	 	,	 photograph 	 y 	 	,	taken	one	after	the	other	.
And	the	photo	 ke 	 pt 	 	 travel 	 ing 	 	even	 with 	 out 	 	us	.
 Hop 	 e 	 fully 	 	,	you	'll	see	the	film	,	and	you	'll	understand	the	scope	of	the	project	and	what	the	people	felt	when	they	saw	 t 	 hose 	 	 photo 	 s 	 	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	that	's	a	big	part	of	it	.	There	's	 layer 	 s 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	each	photo	.
 Be 	 hind 	 	each	image	is	a	story	.
Women	 A 	 re 	 	 Hero 	 es 	 	 create 	 d 	 	a	new	dynamic	in	each	of	the	 commun 	 ities 	 	,	and	the	women	 ke 	 pt 	 	that	dynamic	after	we	left	.
For	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	we	did	 book 	 s 	 	--	not	for	sale	--	that	all	the	community	would	get	.
But	to	get	it	,	they	would	have	to	[	get	]	it	 sign 	 ed 	 	by	one	of	the	women	.
We	did	that	in	most	of	the	 place 	 s 	 	.
We	go	back	 regular 	 ly 	 	.
And	so	in	 Provid 	 en 	 cia 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	in	the	favela	,	we	have	a	controlled	center	running	there	.
In	Kibera	,	each	year	we	cover	more	 roof 	 s 	 	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	of	course	,	when	we	left	,	the	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	just	at	the	edge	of	the	project	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Hey	,	what	about	my	roof	?	''
So	we	 decide 	 d 	 	to	come	the	year	after	and	keep	 do 	 ing 	 	the	project	.
A	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	point	for	me	is	that	I	do	n't	use	any	brand	or	corporate	 sponsor 	 s 	 	.
So	I	have	no	 respons 	 ibility 	 	to	 any 	 one 	 	but	 my 	 self 	 	and	the	 subject 	 s 	 	.
And	that	is	for	me	one	of	the	more	 import 	 ant 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	in	the	work	.
I	think	,	 to 	 day 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	result	is	the	way	you	do	 thing 	 s 	 	.
And	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	certain	part	of	the	work	.
And	what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	is	that	fine	line	that	I	have	with	 image 	 s 	 	and	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	.
We	just	did	some	 past 	 ing 	 	in	 Lo 	 s 	 	 Angel 	 es 	 	on	 an 	 other 	 	project	in	the	last	 week 	 s 	 	.
And	I	was	even	 invit 	 ed 	 	to	cover	the	 MO 	 CA 	 	museum	.
But	 yester 	 day 	 	the	city	 call 	 ed 	 	them	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Look	,	we	're	going	to	have	to	tear	it	down	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	can	be	taken	for	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	,	and	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	law	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	taken	down	.	''
But	tell	me	,	 advert 	 is 	 ing 	 	for	what	?
The	people	I	photograph	 we 	 re 	 	proud	to	 particip 	 ate 	 	in	the	project	and	to	have	 the 	 ir 	 	photo	in	the	community	.
But	they	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	for	a	promise	 bas 	 ically 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	,	``	 P 	 lease 	 	,	make	our	story	travel	with	you	.	''
So	I	did	.	That	's	Paris	.
That	's	 Ri 	 o 	 	.
In	each	place	,	we	built	 exhibit 	 ions 	 	with	a	story	,	and	the	story	 travel 	 ed 	 	.
You	understand	the	full	scope	of	the	project	.
That	's	London	.
New	York	.
And	 to 	 day 	 	,	they	are	with	you	in	Long	 Be 	 ach 	 	.
All	right	,	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	I	 start 	 ed 	 	a	public	art	project	where	I	do	n't	use	my	 art 	 work 	 	 any 	 more 	 	.
I	use	Man	Ray	,	Helen	 Lev 	 itt 	 	,	 Giacom 	 elli 	 	,	other	people	's	 art 	 work 	 	.
It	 do 	 es 	 	n't	matter	 to 	 day 	 	if	it	's	your	photo	or	not	.
The	 import 	 ance 	 	is	what	you	do	with	the	 image 	 s 	 	,	the	 state 	 ment 	 	it	 make 	 s 	 	where	it	's	 past 	 ed 	 	.
So	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	I	 past 	 ed 	 	the	photo	of	the	minaret	in	 Switzer 	 land 	 	a	few	 week 	 s 	 	after	they	 vot 	 ed 	 	the	law	 forbid 	 d 	 ing 	 	 minaret 	 s 	 	in	the	country	.
 Th 	 is 	 	image	of	three	men	 wear 	 ing 	 	gas	 mask 	 s 	 	was	taken	in	Chernobyl	 original 	 ly 	 	,	and	I	 past 	 ed 	 	it	in	 South 	 ern 	 	 It 	 a 	 ly 	 	,	where	the	mafia	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	bury	the	garbage	under	the	ground	.
In	some	ways	,	art	can	change	the	world	.
Art	is	not	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	change	the	world	,	to	change	practical	 thing 	 s 	 	,	but	to	change	 per 	 ception 	 s 	 	.
Art	can	change	the	way	we	see	the	world	.
Art	can	create	an	 analog 	 y 	 	.
 Actu 	 ally 	 	the	fact	that	art	can	not	change	 thing 	 s 	 	 make 	 s 	 	it	a	neutral	place	for	 ex 	 change 	 s 	 	and	 discuss 	 ions 	 	,	and	then	 en 	 able 	 s 	 	you	to	change	the	world	.
When	I	do	my	work	,	I	have	two	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 react 	 ions 	 	.
People	say	,	``	Oh	,	why	do	n't	you	go	in	Iraq	or	 Afghan 	 istan 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	would	be	 re 	 ally 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	.	''
Or	,	``	How	can	we	help	?	''
I	 p 	 resume 	 	that	you	belong	to	the	second	 categor 	 y 	 	,	and	that	's	good	,	 be 	 cause 	 	for	that	project	,	I	'm	going	to	ask	you	to	take	the	 photo 	 s 	 	and	paste	them	.
So	now	my	wish	is	:	I	wish	for	you	to	stand	up	for	what	you	care	about	by	 particip 	 ating 	 	in	a	global	art	project	,	and	together	we	'll	turn	the	world	 in 	 side 	 	out	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	 start 	 s 	 	right	now	.
Yes	,	 every 	 one 	 	in	the	room	.
 Every 	 one 	 	 watch 	 ing 	 	.
I	 want 	 ed 	 	that	wish	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	start	now	.
So	a	subject	you	're	passionate	about	,	a	person	who	you	want	to	tell	 the 	 ir 	 	story	or	even	your	own	 photo 	 s 	 	--	tell	me	what	you	stand	for	.
Take	the	 photo 	 s 	 	,	the	 portrait 	 s 	 	,	upload	it	--	I	'll	give	you	all	the	 detail 	 s 	 	--	and	I	'll	 s 	 end 	 	you	back	your	 post 	 er 	 	.	 Jo 	 in 	 	by	 group 	 s 	 	and	reveal	 thing 	 s 	 	to	the	world	.
The	full	data	is	on	the	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	--	 in 	 side 	 out 	 project 	 .net 	 	--	that	is	 launch 	 ing 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
What	we	see	 change 	 s 	 	who	we	are	.
When	we	act	together	,	the	whole	thing	is	much	more	than	the	sum	of	the	 part 	 s 	 	.
So	I	hope	that	,	together	,	we	'll	create	 some 	 thing 	 	that	the	world	will	remember	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	 start 	 s 	 	right	now	and	 depend 	 s 	 	on	you	.
Thank	you	.
Thank	you	.

 A 	 big 	 ail 	 	 Wash 	 burn 	 	:	 Build 	 ing 	 	 US 	 - 	 China 	 	 relation 	 s 	 	...	by	banjo
If	you	had	caught	me	straight	out	of	college	in	the	 hall 	 s 	 	of	the	 Ver 	 mon 	 t 	 	 Stat 	 e 	 	House	where	I	was	a	 lobby 	 ist 	 	in	training	and	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	what	I	was	going	to	do	with	my	life	,	I	would	have	told	you	that	I	'd	just	 pass 	 ed 	 	the	 Han 	 yu 	 	 Shui 	 ping 	 	Kaoshi	,	the	 Chi 	 nese 	 	 equi 	 val 	 ency 	 	 ex 	 am 	 	,	and	I	was	going	to	go	 stud 	 y 	 	law	in	 Beij 	 ing 	 	,	and	I	was	going	to	improve	 U.S. 	 - 	 China 	 	 relation 	 s 	 	through	 top 	 - 	 down 	 	policy	 change 	 s 	 	and	 judi 	 cial 	 	system	 reform 	 s 	 	.
I	had	a	plan	,	and	I	never	ever	thought	it	would	have	 any 	 thing 	 	to	do	with	the	banjo	.
 Li 	 ttle 	 	did	I	know	what	a	huge	impact	it	would	have	on	me	one	night	when	I	was	at	a	party	and	I	heard	a	sound	coming	out	of	a	record	player	in	the	corner	of	a	room	.
And	it	was	Doc	 Wat 	 son 	 	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	and	 play 	 ing 	 	``	 Sha 	 dy 	 	Grove	.	''
♫	 Sha 	 dy 	 	Grove	,	my	little	love	♫	♫	 Sha 	 dy 	 	Grove	,	my	 darl 	 in 	 	'	♫	♫	 Sha 	 dy 	 	Grove	,	my	little	love	♫	♫	 Go 	 ing 	 	back	to	 Har 	 lan 	 	♫	That	sound	was	just	so	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	the	sound	of	Doc	's	voice	and	the	 rippl 	 ing 	 	groove	of	the	banjo	.
And	after	 be 	 ing 	 	 total 	 ly 	 	and	 complete 	 ly 	 	 obsess 	 ed 	 	with	the	 mamm 	 oth 	 	 rich 	 ness 	 	and	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 Chi 	 nese 	 	culture	,	it	was	like	 th 	 is 	 	total	relief	to	hear	 some 	 thing 	 	so	 tru 	 ly 	 	American	and	so	 tru 	 ly 	 	awesome	.
I	 k 	 new 	 	I	had	to	take	a	banjo	with	me	to	China	.
So	before	going	to	law	school	in	China	I	 b 	 ought 	 	a	banjo	,	I	threw	it	in	my	little	red	truck	and	I	 travel 	 ed 	 	down	through	Appalachia	and	I	 learn 	 ed 	 	a	bunch	of	old	American	 song 	 s 	 	,	and	I	 end 	 ed 	 	up	in	 Ken 	 tuck 	 y 	 	at	the	 Inter 	 national 	 	 Blue 	 grass 	 	Music	 Assoc 	 iation 	 	Convention	.
And	I	was	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	a	 hall 	 way 	 	one	night	and	a	couple	 girl 	 s 	 	came	up	to	me	.
And	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Hey	,	do	you	want	to	jam	?	''
And	I	was	like	,	``	 Su 	 re 	 	.	''
So	I	 pick 	 ed 	 	up	my	banjo	and	I	 nervous 	 ly 	 	 play 	 ed 	 	four	 song 	 s 	 	that	I	 actual 	 ly 	 	 k 	 new 	 	with	them	.
And	a	record	 ex 	 ecutive 	 	 walk 	 ed 	 	up	to	me	and	 invit 	 ed 	 	me	to	 Nash 	 ville 	 	,	 Ten 	 ness 	 ee 	 	to	make	a	record	.
It	's	 be 	 en 	 	eight	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	I	can	tell	you	that	I	did	n't	go	to	China	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	lawyer	.
In	fact	,	I	went	to	 Nash 	 ville 	 	.
And	after	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	I	was	writing	 song 	 s 	 	.
And	the	first	song	I	wrote	was	in	English	,	and	the	second	one	was	in	 Chi 	 nese 	 	.
[	 Chi 	 nese 	 	]	 Out 	 side 	 	your	door	the	world	is	 wait 	 ing 	 	.
 In 	 side 	 	your	heart	a	voice	is	 call 	 ing 	 	.
The	four	 corner 	 s 	 	of	the	world	are	 watch 	 ing 	 	,	so	travel	daughter	,	travel	.
Go	get	it	,	girl	.
It	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 be 	 en 	 	eight	 year 	 s 	 	since	that	 fat 	 ed 	 	night	in	 Ken 	 tuck 	 y 	 	.
And	I	've	 play 	 ed 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 show 	 s 	 	.
And	I	've	 collabor 	 ated 	 	with	so	 man 	 y 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	,	 inspiration 	 al 	 	 music 	 ians 	 	around	the	world	.
And	I	see	the	power	of	music	.
I	see	the	power	of	music	to	connect	 culture 	 s 	 	.
I	see	it	when	I	stand	on	a	stage	in	a	 blue 	 grass 	 	 fest 	 ival 	 	in	east	 Virgin 	 ia 	 	and	I	look	out	at	the	sea	of	lawn	 chair 	 s 	 	and	I	bust	out	 in 	 to 	 	a	song	in	 Chi 	 nese 	 	.
[	 Chi 	 nese 	 	]	And	 every 	 body 	 	's	 eye 	 s 	 	just	pop	wide	open	like	it	's	going	to	fall	out	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 head 	 s 	 	.
And	they	're	like	,	``	What	's	that	girl	 do 	 ing 	 	?	''
And	then	they	come	up	to	me	after	the	show	and	they	all	have	a	story	.
 The 	 y 	 	all	come	up	and	they	're	like	,	``	You	know	,	my	aunt	's	sister	's	babysitter	's	dog	's	chicken	went	to	China	and	 adopt 	 ed 	 	a	girl	.	''
And	I	tell	you	what	,	it	like	 every 	 body 	 	's	got	a	story	.
It	's	just	 in 	 credible 	 	.
And	then	I	go	to	China	and	I	stand	on	a	stage	at	a	university	and	I	bust	out	 in 	 to 	 	a	song	in	 Chi 	 nese 	 	and	 every 	 body 	 	 s 	 ing 	 s 	 	 a 	 long 	 	and	they	roar	with	 de 	 light 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	girl	with	the	hair	and	the	instrument	,	and	she	's	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	music	.
And	I	see	,	even	more	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	the	power	of	music	to	connect	 heart 	 s 	 	.
Like	the	time	I	was	in	Sichuan	 Pro 	 vince 	 	and	I	was	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	for	 kid 	 s 	 	in	 re 	 location 	 	 school 	 s 	 	in	the	 earth 	 quake 	 	disaster	zone	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	little	girl	 come 	 s 	 	up	to	me	.
[	 Chi 	 nese 	 	]	``	Big	sister	 W 	 ong 	 	,	''	 Wash 	 burn 	 	,	 W 	 ong 	 	,	same	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
``	Big	sister	 W 	 ong 	 	,	can	I	 s 	 ing 	 	you	a	song	that	my	mom	 s 	 ang 	 	for	me	before	she	was	 swallow 	 ed 	 	in	the	 earth 	 quake 	 	?	''
And	I	 s 	 at 	 	down	,	she	 s 	 at 	 	on	my	lap	.
She	 start 	 ed 	 	 s 	 ing 	 ing 	 	her	song	.
And	the	 warm 	 th 	 	of	her	body	and	the	 tear 	 s 	 	 roll 	 ing 	 	down	her	 ros 	 y 	 	 cheek 	 s 	 	,	and	I	 start 	 ed 	 	to	cry	.
And	the	light	that	 s 	 hone 	 	off	of	her	 eye 	 s 	 	was	a	place	I	could	have	 stay 	 ed 	 	 fore 	 ver 	 	.
And	in	that	moment	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	n't	our	American	 s 	 elves 	 	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	n't	our	 Chi 	 nese 	 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	just	 mortal 	 s 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	together	in	that	light	that	 keep 	 s 	 	us	here	.
I	want	to	 d 	 well 	 	in	that	light	with	you	and	with	 every 	 one 	 	.
And	I	know	 U.S. 	 - 	 China 	 	 relation 	 s 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	need	 an 	 other 	 	lawyer	.

When	I	was	little	--	and	by	the	way	,	I	was	little	once	--	my	father	told	me	a	story	about	an	18th	century	 watch 	 maker 	 	.
And	what	 th 	 is 	 	guy	had	 d 	 one 	 	:	he	used	to	produce	these	 fabulous 	 ly 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 watch 	 es 	 	.
And	one	day	,	one	of	his	 custom 	 ers 	 	came	 in 	 to 	 	his	 work 	 shop 	 	and	 ask 	 ed 	 	him	to	clean	the	watch	that	he	'd	 b 	 ought 	 	.
And	the	guy	took	it	 a 	 part 	 	,	and	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	he	 pull 	 ed 	 	out	was	one	of	the	balance	 wheel 	 s 	 	.
And	 a 	 s 	 	he	did	so	,	his	 custom 	 er 	 	 notice 	 d 	 	that	on	the	back	side	of	the	balance	wheel	was	an	 engrav 	 ing 	 	,	 we 	 re 	 	 word 	 s 	 	.
And	he	 s 	 aid 	 	to	the	guy	,	``	Why	have	you	put	stuff	on	the	back	that	no	one	will	ever	see	?	''
And	the	 watch 	 maker 	 	 turn 	 ed 	 	around	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	God	can	see	it	.	''
 N 	 ow 	 	I	'm	not	in	the	 l 	 east 	 	bit	religious	,	 n 	 either 	 	was	my	father	,	but	at	that	point	,	I	 notice 	 d 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	here	.
I	felt	 some 	 thing 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 plex 	 us 	 	of	blood	 vessel 	 s 	 	and	 nerve 	 s 	 	,	and	there	must	be	some	 muscle 	 s 	 	in	there	 a 	 s 	 	well	 some 	 where 	 	,	I	guess	.
But	I	felt	 some 	 thing 	 	.
And	it	was	a	 physiologic 	 al 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	.
And	from	that	point	on	,	from	my	age	at	the	time	,	I	 beg 	 an 	 	to	think	of	 thing 	 s 	 	in	a	different	way	.
And	 a 	 s 	 	I	took	on	my	 care 	 er 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	 design 	 er 	 	,	I	 beg 	 an 	 	to	ask	 my 	 self 	 	the	simple	question	:	Do	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	think	 beaut 	 y 	 	,	or	do	we	feel	it	?
 N 	 ow 	 	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	know	the	answer	to	 th 	 is 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	.
You	 prob 	 ably 	 	think	,	well	,	I	do	n't	know	which	one	you	think	it	is	,	but	I	think	it	's	about	 feel 	 ing 	 	 beaut 	 y 	 	.
And	so	I	then	 move 	 d 	 	on	 in 	 to 	 	my	design	 care 	 er 	 	and	 beg 	 an 	 	to	find	some	 excit 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
One	of	the	most	early	work	was	 d 	 one 	 	in	 auto 	 motive 	 	design	--	some	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	work	was	 d 	 one 	 	there	.
And	 dur 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	 th 	 is 	 	work	,	we	found	 some 	 thing 	 	,	or	I	found	 some 	 thing 	 	,	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 fascinate 	 d 	 	me	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	you	can	remember	it	.
Do	you	remember	when	 light 	 s 	 	used	to	just	go	on	and	off	,	click	click	,	when	you	closed	the	door	in	a	car	?
And	then	 some 	 body 	 	,	I	think	it	was	BMW	,	 introduc 	 ed 	 	a	light	that	went	out	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	.
 Re 	 member 	 	that	?
I	remember	it	 clear 	 ly 	 	.
Do	you	remember	the	first	time	you	 we 	 re 	 	in	a	car	and	it	did	that	?
I	remember	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	 think 	 ing 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	fantastic	.
In	fact	,	I	've	never	found	 any 	 body 	 	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	like	the	light	that	 go 	 es 	 	out	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	.
I	thought	,	well	what	the	hell	's	that	about	?
So	I	 start 	 ed 	 	to	ask	 my 	 self 	 	 question 	 s 	 	about	it	.
And	the	first	was	,	I	'd	ask	other	people	:	``	Do	you	like	it	?	''	``	Yes	.	''
``	Why	?	''	And	they	'd	say	,	``	Oh	,	it	 feel 	 s 	 	so	natural	,	''	or	,	``	It	's	nice	.	''
I	thought	,	well	that	's	not	good	 en 	 ough 	 	.
Can	we	cut	down	a	little	bit	further	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	 design 	 er 	 	,	I	need	the	 vocabul 	 ary 	 	,	I	need	the	 key 	 board 	 	,	of	how	 th 	 is 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 work 	 s 	 	.
And	so	I	did	some	 experiment 	 s 	 	.
And	I	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 real 	 ized 	 	that	there	was	 some 	 thing 	 	that	did	 exact 	 ly 	 	that	--	light	to	dark	in	six	 second 	 s 	 	--	 exact 	 ly 	 	that	.
Do	you	know	what	it	is	?	 Any 	 one 	 	?
You	see	,	using	 th 	 is 	 	bit	,	the	 think 	 y 	 	bit	,	the	 s 	 low 	 	bit	of	the	brain	--	using	that	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	n't	a	think	,	it	's	a	feel	.
And	would	you	do	me	a	favor	?
For	the	next	14	 minute 	 s 	 	or	 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	,	will	you	feel	stuff	?
I	do	n't	need	you	to	think	so	much	 a 	 s 	 	I	want	you	to	feel	it	.
I	felt	a	sense	of	 relax 	 ation 	 	 temper 	 ed 	 	with	 anticip 	 ation 	 	.
And	that	thing	that	I	found	was	the	cinema	or	the	theater	.
It	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	just	 happen 	 ed 	 	here	--	light	to	dark	in	six	 second 	 s 	 	.
And	when	that	 happen 	 s 	 	,	are	you	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	going	,	``	No	,	the	movie	's	about	to	start	,	''	or	are	you	going	,	``	That	's	fantastic	.	I	'm	looking	forward	to	it	.
I	get	a	sense	of	 anticip 	 ation 	 	''	?
 N 	 ow 	 	I	'm	not	a	 neuro 	 scientist 	 	.
I	do	n't	know	even	if	there	is	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	a	 condition 	 ed 	 	 re 	 flex 	 	.
But	it	might	be	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	the	people	I	speak	to	in	the	 north 	 ern 	 	 hemi 	 sphere 	 	that	used	to	go	in	the	cinema	get	 th 	 is 	 	.
And	some	of	the	people	I	speak	to	that	have	never	 s 	 een 	 	a	movie	or	 be 	 en 	 	to	the	theater	do	n't	get	it	in	the	same	way	.
 Every 	 body 	 	 like 	 s 	 	it	,	but	some	like	it	more	than	 other 	 s 	 	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	 lead 	 s 	 	me	to	think	of	 th 	 is 	 	in	a	different	way	.
We	're	not	 feel 	 ing 	 	it	.	We	're	 think 	 ing 	 	 beaut 	 y 	 	is	in	the	 limb 	 ic 	 	system	--	if	that	's	not	an	 out 	 mod 	 ed 	 	idea	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	the	bits	,	the	pleasure	 center 	 s 	 	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	what	I	'm	 see 	 ing 	 	and	 sens 	 ing 	 	and	 feel 	 ing 	 	is	 bypass 	 ing 	 	my	 think 	 ing 	 	.
The	wiring	from	your	 sensor 	 y 	 	apparatus	to	 t 	 hose 	 	bits	is	 short 	 er 	 	than	the	bits	that	have	to	pass	through	the	 think 	 y 	 	bit	,	the	cortex	.
 The 	 y 	 	 arriv 	 e 	 	first	.
So	how	do	we	make	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	work	?
And	how	much	of	that	 re 	 active 	 	side	of	it	is	due	to	what	we	 al 	 ready 	 	know	,	or	what	we	're	going	to	learn	,	about	 some 	 thing 	 	?
 Th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	most	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	I	know	.
It	's	a	plastic	bag	.
And	when	I	 look 	 ed 	 	at	it	first	,	I	thought	,	no	,	there	's	no	 beaut 	 y 	 	in	that	.
 Th 	 en 	 	I	found	out	,	post	 expo 	 s 	 ure 	 	,	that	 th 	 is 	 	plastic	bag	if	I	put	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	 filth 	 y 	 	 pudd 	 le 	 	or	a	stream	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	 coli 	 form 	 s 	 	and	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 disgust 	 ing 	 	stuff	,	that	that	 filth 	 y 	 	water	will	 migr 	 ate 	 	through	the	wall	of	the	bag	by	osmosis	and	end	up	 in 	 side 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	 pur 	 e 	 	,	 pot 	 able 	 	 drink 	 ing 	 	water	.
And	all	of	a	sudden	,	 th 	 is 	 	plastic	bag	was	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	to	me	.
 N 	 ow 	 	I	'm	going	to	ask	you	 aga 	 in 	 	to	 s 	 witch 	 	on	the	 emotion 	 al 	 	bit	.
Would	you	mind	taking	the	brain	out	,	and	I	just	want	you	to	feel	 some 	 thing 	 	.
Look	at	that	.	What	are	you	 feel 	 ing 	 	about	it	?
 I 	 s 	 	it	 beaut 	 iful 	 	?	 I 	 s 	 	it	 excit 	 ing 	 	?
I	'm	 watch 	 ing 	 	your	 face 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 care 	 fully 	 	.
There	's	some	 ra 	 ther 	 	 bor 	 ed 	 - 	 looking 	 	 gentle 	 men 	 	and	some	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	 engag 	 ed 	 - 	 looking 	 	 lad 	 ies 	 	who	are	 pick 	 ing 	 	up	 some 	 thing 	 	off	that	.
 May 	 be 	 	there	's	an	 innoc 	 ence 	 	to	it	.
 N 	 ow 	 	I	'm	going	to	tell	you	what	it	is	.	 A 	 re 	 	you	ready	?
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	last	act	on	 th 	 is 	 	Earth	of	a	little	girl	 call 	 ed 	 	 He 	 idi 	 	,	five	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	before	she	 di 	 ed 	 	of	cancer	to	the	 s 	 pine 	 	.
It	's	the	last	thing	she	did	,	the	last	physical	act	.
Look	at	that	picture	.
Look	at	the	 innoc 	 ence 	 	.	Look	at	the	 beaut 	 y 	 	in	it	.
 I 	 s 	 	it	 beaut 	 iful 	 	now	?
 S 	 top 	 	.	 S 	 top 	 	.	How	do	you	feel	?
Where	are	you	 feel 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	?
I	'm	 feel 	 ing 	 	it	here	.	I	feel	it	here	.
And	I	'm	 watch 	 ing 	 	your	 face 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	your	 face 	 s 	 	are	 tell 	 ing 	 	me	 some 	 thing 	 	.
The	 lad 	 y 	 	over	there	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 cry 	 ing 	 	,	by	the	way	.
But	what	are	you	 do 	 ing 	 	?
I	watch	what	people	do	.
I	watch	 face 	 s 	 	.
I	watch	 react 	 ions 	 	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	I	have	to	know	how	people	react	to	 thing 	 s 	 	.
And	one	of	the	most	common	 face 	 s 	 	on	 some 	 thing 	 	 face 	 d 	 	with	 beaut 	 y 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	 stupefy 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 delic 	 ious 	 	,	is	what	I	call	the	 O 	 MG 	 	.
And	by	the	way	,	there	's	no	pleasure	in	that	face	.
It	's	not	a	``	 th 	 is 	 	is	 wonder 	 ful 	 	!	''
The	 eye 	 brow 	 s 	 	are	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	the	 eye 	 s 	 	are	 de 	 focused 	 	,	and	the	mouth	is	 hang 	 ing 	 	open	.
That	's	not	the	 express 	 ion 	 	of	joy	.
There	's	 some 	 thing 	 	else	in	that	.
There	's	 some 	 thing 	 	weird	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
So	pleasure	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	 temper 	 ed 	 	by	a	whole	 s 	 eries 	 	of	different	 thing 	 s 	 	coming	in	.
 Poign 	 ancy 	 	is	a	word	I	love	 a 	 s 	 	a	 design 	 er 	 	.
It	 mean 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 trigger 	 ing 	 	a	big	 emotion 	 al 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	,	often	 quit 	 e 	 	a	 s 	 ad 	 	 emotion 	 al 	 	 respons 	 e 	 	,	but	it	's	part	of	what	we	do	.
It	is	n't	just	about	nice	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	dilemma	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	paradox	,	of	 beaut 	 y 	 	.
 Sen 	 s 	 or 	 ily 	 	,	we	're	taking	in	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	--	 mix 	 ture 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	good	,	bad	,	 excit 	 ing 	 	,	 frighten 	 ing 	 	--	to	come	up	with	that	 sensor 	 ial 	 	 expo 	 s 	 ure 	 	,	that	 sens 	 ation 	 	of	what	's	going	on	.
 Path 	 os 	 	 appear 	 s 	 	 obvious 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	part	of	what	you	just	saw	in	that	little	girl	's	 draw 	 ing 	 	.
And	 al 	 so 	 	triumph	,	 th 	 is 	 	sense	of	 transcend 	 ence 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	``	I	never	 k 	 new 	 	that	.	Ah	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	new	.	''
And	that	's	 pack 	 ed 	 	in	there	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
And	 a 	 s 	 	we	assemble	these	 tool 	 s 	 	,	from	a	design	point	of	view	,	I	get	 terr 	 ibly 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	these	are	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	've	 al 	 ready 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	they	're	 arriv 	 ing 	 	at	the	brain	,	it	would	seem	,	before	cognition	,	before	we	can	 manipul 	 ate 	 	them	--	 electro 	 chemical 	 	party	 trick 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	what	I	'm	 al 	 so 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	is	:	 I 	 s 	 	it	possible	to	 separat 	 e 	 	intrinsic	and	 extr 	 in 	 s 	 ic 	 	 beaut 	 y 	 	?
By	that	,	I	mean	 intrinsic 	 ally 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	just	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	 exquisite 	 ly 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	that	's	 universal 	 ly 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
 Ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	find	.	 May 	 be 	 	you	've	got	some	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	it	.
 Ver 	 y 	 	hard	to	find	 some 	 thing 	 	that	,	to	 every 	 body 	 	,	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	thing	,	 with 	 out 	 	a	certain	amount	of	information	 pack 	 ed 	 	in	there	before	.
So	a	lot	of	it	 tend 	 s 	 	to	be	 extr 	 in 	 s 	 ic 	 	.
It	's	 mediate 	 d 	 	by	information	before	the	 comprehens 	 ion 	 	.
Or	the	information	's	 add 	 ed 	 	on	at	the	back	,	like	that	little	girl	's	 draw 	 ing 	 	that	I	 show 	 ed 	 	you	.
 N 	 ow 	 	when	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 beaut 	 y 	 	you	ca	n't	get	away	from	the	fact	that	a	lot	 experiment 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 d 	 one 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	with	 face 	 s 	 	and	what	have	you	.
And	one	of	the	most	 ted 	 ious 	 	 one 	 s 	 	,	I	think	,	was	 say 	 ing 	 	that	 beaut 	 y 	 	was	about	symmetry	.
Well	it	 obvious 	 ly 	 	is	n't	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	one	where	half	 face 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 show 	 n 	 	to	some	people	,	and	then	to	add	them	 in 	 to 	 	a	list	of	most	 beaut 	 iful 	 	to	 l 	 east 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	and	then	 ex 	 posing 	 	a	full	face	.
And	they	found	that	it	was	 al 	 most 	 	exact	 co 	 incidence 	 	.
So	it	was	n't	about	symmetry	.
In	fact	,	 th 	 is 	 	 lad 	 y 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 a 	 symmetric 	 al 	 	face	,	of	which	both	 side 	 s 	 	are	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
But	they	're	both	different	.
And	 a 	 s 	 	a	 design 	 er 	 	,	I	ca	n't	help	 meddl 	 ing 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	,	so	I	 pull 	 ed 	 	it	to	bits	and	sort	of	did	stuff	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	understand	what	the	individual	 element 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	,	but	 feel 	 ing 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	I	go	.
 N 	 ow 	 	I	can	feel	a	 sens 	 ation 	 	of	 de 	 light 	 	and	 beaut 	 y 	 	if	I	look	at	that	eye	.
I	'm	not	 get 	 ting 	 	it	off	the	 eye 	 brow 	 	.
And	the	 ear 	 hole 	 	is	n't	 do 	 ing 	 	it	to	me	at	all	.
So	I	do	n't	know	how	much	 th 	 is 	 	is	 help 	 ing 	 	me	,	but	it	's	 help 	 ing 	 	to	guide	me	to	the	 place 	 s 	 	where	the	 signal 	 s 	 	are	coming	off	.
And	 a 	 s 	 	I	say	,	I	'm	not	a	 neuro 	 scientist 	 	,	but	to	understand	how	I	can	start	to	assemble	 thing 	 s 	 	that	will	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	bypass	 th 	 is 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	part	and	get	me	to	the	 enjoy 	 able 	 	 pre 	 cognitive 	 	 element 	 s 	 	.
 Ana 	 is 	 	Nin	and	the	 Tal 	 mud 	 	have	told	us	time	and	time	 aga 	 in 	 	that	we	see	 thing 	 s 	 	not	 a 	 s 	 	they	are	,	but	 a 	 s 	 	we	are	.
So	I	'm	going	to	 shame 	 lessly 	 	 ex 	 pose 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	to	you	,	which	is	 beaut 	 iful 	 	to	me	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 F 	 1 	 	 M 	 V 	 	 Agus 	 ta 	 	.
 A 	 hhhh 	 	.
It	is	 re 	 ally 	 	--	I	mean	,	I	ca	n't	express	to	you	how	exquisite	 th 	 is 	 	object	is	.
But	I	 al 	 so 	 	know	why	it	's	exquisite	to	me	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	a	palimpsest	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
It	's	 masse 	 s 	 	and	 masse 	 s 	 	of	 layer 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	just	the	bit	that	 protr 	 ude 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	our	physical	dimension	.
It	's	 some 	 thing 	 	much	 big 	 ger 	 	.
 Lay 	 er 	 	after	layer	of	legend	,	 s 	 port 	 	,	 detail 	 s 	 	that	 reson 	 ate 	 	.
I	mean	,	if	I	just	go	through	some	of	them	now	--	I	know	about	 lam 	 in 	 ar 	 	flow	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	 air 	 - 	 pierc 	 ing 	 	 object 	 s 	 	,	and	that	 do 	 es 	 	it	 consum 	 mate 	 ly 	 	well	,	you	can	see	it	can	.
So	that	's	 get 	 ting 	 	me	 excit 	 ed 	 	.
And	I	feel	that	here	.
 Th 	 is 	 	bit	,	the	big	secret	of	 auto 	 motive 	 	design	--	 reflect 	 ion 	 	management	.
It	's	not	about	the	 shape 	 s 	 	,	it	's	how	the	 shape 	 s 	 	reflect	light	.
 N 	 ow 	 	that	thing	,	light	 flick 	 ers 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	you	move	,	so	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	 kine 	 tic 	 	object	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	it	's	 stand 	 ing 	 	still	--	 manage 	 d 	 	by	how	 brilli 	 ant 	 ly 	 	that	's	 d 	 one 	 	on	the	 reflect 	 ion 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	little	relief	on	the	 foot 	 plate 	 	,	by	the	way	,	to	a	rider	 mean 	 s 	 	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	going	on	 under 	 neath 	 	it	--	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	a	drive	chain	running	at	300	 mile 	 s 	 	and	hour	 prob 	 ably 	 	,	taking	the	power	from	the	engine	.

I	ca	n't	tell	you	how	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	.
That	's	how	you	stop	the	nuts	coming	off	at	high	speed	on	the	wheel	.
I	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	now	.
And	of	course	,	a	 rac 	 ing 	 	bike	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	a	prop	stand	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	one	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	a	road	bike	,	it	all	 go 	 es 	 	away	and	it	 fold 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	little	gap	.
So	it	 disappear 	 s 	 	.
And	then	I	ca	n't	tell	you	how	hard	it	is	to	do	that	 radi 	 ator 	 	,	which	is	 curv 	 ed 	 	.
Why	would	you	do	that	?
 Be 	 cause 	 	I	know	we	need	to	 br 	 ing 	 	the	wheel	 far 	 ther 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 aero 	 dynamic 	 s 	 	.
So	it	's	more	expensive	,	but	it	's	 wonder 	 ful 	 	.
And	to	cap	it	all	,	brand	 royal 	 ty 	 	--	 Agus 	 ta 	 	,	Count	 Agus 	 ta 	 	,	from	the	great	 histo 	 ries 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	.

There	's	so	little	 com 	 promise 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	,	you	ca	n't	see	it	.
But	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	the	 like 	 s 	 	of	me	and	people	that	are	like	me	have	to	deal	with	 com 	 promise 	 	all	the	time	with	 beaut 	 y 	 	.
We	have	to	deal	with	it	.
So	I	have	to	work	with	a	supply	chain	,	and	I	've	got	to	work	with	the	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	and	I	've	got	to	work	with	 every 	 thing 	 	else	all	the	time	,	and	so	 com 	 promise 	 s 	 	start	to	fit	 in 	 to 	 	it	.
And	so	look	at	her	.
I	've	had	to	make	a	bit	of	a	 com 	 promise 	 	there	.
I	've	had	to	move	that	part	 a 	 cross 	 	,	but	 on 	 ly 	 	a	millimeter	.
No	one	's	 notice 	 d 	 	,	have	they	yet	?
Did	you	see	what	I	did	?
I	 move 	 d 	 	three	 thing 	 s 	 	by	a	millimeter	.
 Pre 	 tty 	 	?	Yes	.
 Beau 	 ti 	 ful 	 	?	 May 	 be 	 	 less 	 er 	 	.
But	then	,	of	course	,	the	consumer	 say 	 s 	 	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	matter	.
So	that	's	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	is	n't	it	?
 An 	 other 	 	millimeter	?
No	one	's	going	to	notice	 t 	 hose 	 	split	lines	and	 change 	 s 	 	.
It	's	that	easy	to	lose	 beaut 	 y 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 beaut 	 y 	 	's	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	difficult	to	do	.
And	 on 	 ly 	 	a	few	people	can	do	it	.
And	a	focus	group	can	not	do	it	.
And	a	team	 rare 	 ly 	 	can	do	it	.
It	 take 	 s 	 	a	central	cortex	,	if	you	like	,	to	be	able	to	 orchestra 	 te 	 	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 element 	 s 	 	at	the	same	time	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	water	bottle	--	some	of	you	know	of	it	--	 d 	 one 	 	by	Ross	 Love 	 grove 	 	,	the	 design 	 er 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	close	to	intrinsic	 beaut 	 y 	 	.	 Th 	 is 	 	one	,	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	you	know	what	water	is	like	then	you	can	experience	 th 	 is 	 	.
It	's	 love 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	an	 embodi 	 ment 	 	of	 some 	 thing 	 	 re 	 fresh 	 ing 	 	and	 delic 	 ious 	 	.
I	might	like	it	more	than	you	like	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	I	know	how	 blood 	 y 	 	hard	it	is	to	do	it	.
It	's	 stupefy 	 ing 	 ly 	 	difficult	to	make	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 re 	 fract 	 s 	 	light	like	that	,	that	 come 	 s 	 	out	of	the	tool	 correct 	 ly 	 	,	that	 go 	 es 	 	down	the	line	 with 	 out 	 	 fall 	 ing 	 	over	.
 Under 	 neath 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	like	the	story	of	the	 s 	 wan 	 	,	is	a	million	 thing 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	to	do	.
So	all	hail	to	that	.
It	's	a	fantastic	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	a	simple	object	.
And	the	one	I	 show 	 ed 	 	you	before	was	,	of	course	,	a	 massive 	 ly 	 	complex	one	.
And	they	're	 work 	 ing 	 	in	 beaut 	 y 	 	in	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	different	ways	 be 	 cause 	 	of	it	.
You	all	,	I	guess	,	like	me	,	enjoy	 watch 	 ing 	 	a	ballet	 danc 	 er 	 	dance	.
And	part	of	the	joy	of	it	is	,	you	know	the	 difficult 	 y 	 	.
You	 al 	 so 	 	may	be	taking	 in 	 to 	 	account	the	fact	that	it	's	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 pain 	 ful 	 	.
 Any 	 body 	 	 s 	 een 	 	a	ballet	 danc 	 er 	 	's	 to 	 es 	 	when	they	come	out	of	the	 point 	 s 	 	?
 Whi 	 le 	 	she	's	 do 	 ing 	 	these	 grace 	 ful 	 	 arabesque 	 s 	 	and	plies	and	what	have	you	,	 some 	 thing 	 	 horr 	 ible 	 	's	going	on	down	here	.
The	 comprehens 	 ion 	 	of	it	 lead 	 s 	 	us	to	a	 great 	 er 	 	and	 height 	 ened 	 	sense	of	the	 beaut 	 y 	 	of	what	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	going	on	.
 N 	 ow 	 	I	'm	using	 micro 	 second 	 s 	 	 wrong 	 ly 	 	here	,	so	 pleas 	 e 	 	 ignor 	 e 	 	me	.
But	what	I	have	to	do	now	,	 feel 	 ing 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	,	what	I	've	got	to	do	is	to	be	able	to	supply	 en 	 ough 	 	of	these	 enzyme 	 s 	 	,	of	these	 trigger 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	early	on	in	the	process	,	that	you	pick	it	up	,	not	through	your	 think 	 ing 	 	,	but	through	your	 feel 	 ing 	 	.
So	we	're	going	to	have	a	little	experiment	.
Right	,	are	you	ready	?	I	'm	going	to	show	you	 some 	 thing 	 	for	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	brief	moment	.
 A 	 re 	 	you	ready	?	 Oka 	 y 	 	.
Did	you	think	that	was	a	 bi 	 cycle 	 	when	I	 show 	 ed 	 	it	to	you	at	the	first	flash	?
It	's	not	.
Tell	me	 some 	 thing 	 	,	did	you	think	it	was	quick	when	you	first	saw	it	?	Yes	you	did	.
Did	you	think	it	was	modern	?	Yes	you	did	.
That	 bli 	 p 	 	,	that	information	,	shot	 in 	 to 	 	you	before	that	.
And	 be 	 cause 	 	your	brain	 start 	 er 	 	motor	 beg 	 an 	 	there	,	now	it	's	got	to	deal	with	it	.
And	the	great	thing	is	,	 th 	 is 	 	 motor 	 cycle 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 styl 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	way	 specific 	 ally 	 	to	 en 	 gender 	 	a	sense	that	it	's	green	technology	and	it	's	good	for	you	and	it	's	light	and	it	's	all	part	of	the	future	.
So	is	that	wrong	?
Well	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	it	is	n't	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 eco 	 logically 	 - 	 sound 	 	piece	of	technology	.
But	you	're	a	slave	of	that	first	flash	.
We	are	 slave 	 s 	 	to	the	first	few	 fraction 	 s 	 	of	a	second	--	and	that	's	where	much	of	my	work	 ha 	 s 	 	to	win	or	lose	,	on	a	shelf	in	a	shop	.
It	 win 	 s 	 	or	 lose 	 s 	 	at	that	point	.
You	may	see	50	,	100	,	200	 thing 	 s 	 	on	a	shelf	 a 	 s 	 	you	walk	down	it	,	but	I	have	to	work	 with 	 in 	 	that	domain	,	to	ensure	that	it	 get 	 s 	 	you	there	first	.
And	 final 	 ly 	 	,	the	layer	that	I	love	,	of	knowledge	.
Some	of	you	,	I	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	,	will	be	familiar	with	 th 	 is 	 	.
What	's	 in 	 credible 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	the	way	I	love	to	come	back	to	it	,	is	 th 	 is 	 	is	taking	 some 	 thing 	 	that	you	hate	or	 bore 	 s 	 	you	,	 fold 	 ing 	 	 clothe 	 s 	 	,	and	if	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	 th 	 is 	 	--	who	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	 th 	 is 	 	?	 Any 	 body 	 	try	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	?
Yeah	?
It	's	fantastic	,	is	n't	it	?
Look	at	that	.	Do	you	want	to	see	it	 aga 	 in 	 	?
No	time	.	It	 say 	 s 	 	I	have	two	 minute 	 s 	 	left	,	so	we	ca	n't	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
But	just	go	to	the	Web	,	YouTube	,	pull	it	down	,	``	 fold 	 ing 	 	 T 	 - 	 shirt 	 	.	''
That	's	how	 under 	 paid 	 	 young 	 er 	 - 	 aged 	 	people	have	to	fold	your	 T 	 - 	 shirt 	 	.
You	did	n't	 may 	 be 	 	know	it	.
But	how	do	you	feel	about	it	?
It	 feel 	 s 	 	fantastic	when	you	do	it	,	you	look	forward	to	 do 	 ing 	 	it	,	and	when	you	tell	 some 	 body 	 	else	about	it	--	like	you	 prob 	 ably 	 	have	--	you	look	 re 	 ally 	 	smart	.
The	knowledge	bubble	that	 s 	 it 	 s 	 	around	the	 out 	 side 	 	,	the	stuff	that	 cost 	 s 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	knowledge	is	free	--	 bundl 	 e 	 	that	together	and	where	do	we	come	out	?
Form	 follow 	 s 	 	function	?
 On 	 ly 	 	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	.	 On 	 ly 	 	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	.
Form	is	function	.	Form	is	function	.
It	 inform 	 s 	 	,	it	 tell 	 s 	 	us	,	it	 suppli 	 es 	 	us	 answer 	 s 	 	before	we	've	even	thought	about	it	.
And	so	I	've	 stop 	 ped 	 	using	 word 	 s 	 	like	``	form	,	''	and	I	've	 stop 	 ped 	 	using	 word 	 s 	 	like	``	function	''	 a 	 s 	 	a	 design 	 er 	 	.
What	I	try	to	pursue	now	is	the	 emotion 	 al 	 	 functional 	 ity 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	if	I	can	get	that	right	,	I	can	make	them	 wonder 	 ful 	 	,	and	I	can	make	them	 repeat 	 ed 	 ly 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	.
And	you	know	what	 t 	 hose 	 	 product 	 s 	 	and	 service 	 s 	 	are	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	own	some	of	them	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	'd	snatch	if	the	house	was	on	fire	.
 Form 	 ing 	 	the	 emotion 	 al 	 	bond	between	 th 	 is 	 	thing	and	you	is	an	 electro 	 chemical 	 	party	trick	that	 happen 	 s 	 	before	you	even	think	about	it	.
Thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.

 A 	 lain 	 	de	 Bot 	 ton 	 	:	 A 	 theism 	 	2.0
One	of	the	most	common	ways	of	 divid 	 ing 	 	the	world	is	 in 	 to 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	who	 believ 	 e 	 	and	 t 	 hose 	 	who	do	n't	--	 in 	 to 	 	the	religious	and	the	 atheist 	 s 	 	.
And	for	the	last	decade	or	so	,	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	clear	what	 be 	 ing 	 	an	atheist	 mean 	 s 	 	.
There	have	 be 	 en 	 	some	 ver 	 y 	 	vocal	 atheist 	 s 	 	who	've	 point 	 ed 	 	out	,	not	just	that	 relig 	 ion 	 	is	wrong	,	but	that	it	's	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	people	,	 man 	 y 	 	of	whom	have	lived	in	North	Oxford	,	have	 argu 	 ed 	 	--	they	've	 argu 	 ed 	 	that	 believ 	 ing 	 	in	God	is	 a 	 kin 	 	to	 believ 	 ing 	 	in	 fair 	 ies 	 	and	 essential 	 ly 	 	that	the	whole	thing	is	a	 child 	 ish 	 	game	.
 N 	 ow 	 	I	think	it	's	too	easy	.
I	think	it	's	too	easy	to	dismiss	the	whole	of	 relig 	 ion 	 	that	way	.
And	it	's	 a 	 s 	 	easy	 a 	 s 	 	 shoot 	 ing 	 	fish	in	a	barrel	.
And	what	I	'd	like	to	 inaugu 	 rate 	 	 to 	 day 	 	is	a	new	way	of	 be 	 ing 	 	an	atheist	--	if	you	like	,	a	new	version	of	 a 	 theism 	 	we	could	call	 A 	 theism 	 	2.0	.
 N 	 ow 	 	what	is	 A 	 theism 	 	2.0	?
Well	it	 start 	 s 	 	from	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 bas 	 ic 	 	 pre 	 mise 	 	:	of	course	,	there	's	no	God	.
Of	course	,	there	are	no	 de 	 ities 	 	or	 super 	 natural 	 	 spirit 	 s 	 	or	 angel 	 s 	 	,	etc	.
 N 	 ow 	 	let	's	move	on	;	that	's	not	the	end	of	the	story	,	that	's	the	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 begin 	 ning 	 	.
I	'm	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	the	kind	of	 constit 	 uency 	 	that	 think 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 a 	 long 	 	these	lines	:	that	 think 	 s 	 	,	``	I	ca	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	in	any	of	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	.
I	ca	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	in	the	 doctri 	 nes 	 	.
I	do	n't	think	these	 doctri 	 nes 	 	are	right	.
But	,	''	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	but	,	``	I	love	 Christ 	 ma 	 s 	 	 car 	 ol 	 s 	 	.
I	 re 	 ally 	 	like	the	art	of	 Man 	 teg 	 na 	 	.
I	 re 	 ally 	 	like	looking	at	old	 church 	 es 	 	.
I	 re 	 ally 	 	like	 turn 	 ing 	 	the	 page 	 s 	 	of	the	Old	 T 	 esta 	 ment 	 	.	''
 What 	 ever 	 	it	may	be	,	you	know	the	kind	of	thing	I	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	--	people	who	are	 attract 	 ed 	 	to	the	 ritual 	 istic 	 	side	,	the	 moral 	 istic 	 	,	 commun 	 al 	 	side	of	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	but	ca	n't	bear	the	 doctri 	 ne 	 	.
 Un 	 til 	 	now	,	these	people	have	 face 	 d 	 	a	 ra 	 ther 	 	 un 	 pleas 	 ant 	 	choice	.
It	's	 al 	 most 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	either	you	accept	the	 doctri 	 ne 	 	and	then	you	can	have	all	the	nice	stuff	,	or	you	reject	the	 doctri 	 ne 	 	and	you	're	living	in	some	kind	of	spiritual	 waste 	 land 	 	under	the	 gui 	 dance 	 	of	CNN	and	 Wal 	 mar 	 t 	 	.
So	that	's	a	sort	of	tough	choice	.
I	do	n't	think	we	have	to	make	that	choice	.
I	think	there	is	an	 alter 	 native 	 	.
I	think	there	are	ways	--	and	I	'm	 be 	 ing 	 	both	 ver 	 y 	 	 respect 	 ful 	 	and	 complete 	 ly 	 	 imp 	 ious 	 	--	of	 steal 	 ing 	 	from	 relig 	 ions 	 	.
If	you	do	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	in	a	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	wrong	with	 pick 	 ing 	 	and	 mix 	 ing 	 	,	with	taking	out	the	best	 side 	 s 	 	of	 relig 	 ion 	 	.
And	for	me	,	 a 	 theism 	 	2.0	is	about	both	,	 a 	 s 	 	I	say	,	a	 respect 	 ful 	 	and	an	 imp 	 ious 	 	way	of	going	through	 relig 	 ions 	 	and	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	What	here	could	we	use	?	''
The	secular	world	is	full	of	 hole 	 s 	 	.
We	have	 secular 	 ized 	 	 bad 	 ly 	 	,	I	would	 argu 	 e 	 	.
And	a	thorough	 stud 	 y 	 	of	 relig 	 ion 	 	could	give	us	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 in 	 sight 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 area 	 s 	 	of	life	that	are	not	going	too	well	.
And	I	'd	like	to	run	through	a	few	of	these	 to 	 day 	 	.
I	'd	like	to	kick	off	by	looking	at	education	.
 N 	 ow 	 	education	is	a	field	the	secular	world	 re 	 ally 	 	 believ 	 es 	 	in	.
When	we	think	about	how	we	're	going	to	make	the	world	a	better	place	,	we	think	education	;	that	's	where	we	put	a	lot	of	money	.
 Educ 	 ation 	 	is	going	to	give	us	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	commercial	 skill 	 s 	 	,	industrial	 skill 	 s 	 	,	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	going	to	make	us	better	people	.
You	know	the	kind	of	thing	a	 commen 	 cement 	 	address	is	,	and	 gradu 	 ation 	 	 ceremoni 	 es 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 lyric 	 al 	 	 claim 	 s 	 	that	education	,	the	process	of	education	--	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 high 	 er 	 	education	--	will	make	us	 in 	 to 	 	 noble 	 r 	 	and	better	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
That	's	a	 love 	 ly 	 	idea	.
 Inter 	 est 	 ing 	 	where	it	came	from	.
In	the	early	19th	century	,	church	 attend 	 ance 	 	in	Western	 Euro 	 pe 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	 slid 	 ing 	 	down	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 sharp 	 ly 	 	,	and	people	 panic 	 ked 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	question	.
 The 	 y 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	where	are	people	going	to	find	the	 moral 	 ity 	 	,	where	are	they	going	to	find	 gui 	 dance 	 	,	and	where	are	they	going	to	find	 source 	 s 	 	of	 consol 	 ation 	 	?
And	 in 	 fluent 	 ial 	 	 voice 	 s 	 	came	up	with	one	answer	.
 The 	 y 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	culture	.
It	's	to	culture	that	we	should	look	for	 gui 	 dance 	 	,	for	 consol 	 ation 	 	,	for	 moral 	 ity 	 	.
Let	's	look	to	the	 play 	 s 	 	of	Shakespeare	,	the	 dia 	 logues 	 	of	Plato	,	the	 novel 	 s 	 	of	Jane	 Au 	 sten 	 	.
In	there	,	we	'll	find	a	lot	of	the	 truth 	 s 	 	that	we	might	 previous 	 ly 	 	have	found	in	the	Gospel	of	Saint	John	.
 N 	 ow 	 	I	think	that	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	idea	and	a	 ver 	 y 	 	true	idea	.
 The 	 y 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	replace	 script 	 ure 	 	with	culture	.
And	that	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	plausible	idea	.
It	's	 al 	 so 	 	an	idea	that	we	have	 for 	 gotten 	 	.
If	you	went	to	a	top	university	--	let	's	say	you	went	to	Harvard	or	Oxford	or	 Cam 	 bridge 	 	--	and	you	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	I	've	come	here	 be 	 cause 	 	I	'm	in	search	of	 moral 	 ity 	 	,	 gui 	 dance 	 	and	 consol 	 ation 	 	;	I	want	to	know	how	to	live	,	''	they	would	show	you	the	way	to	the	 insan 	 e 	 	asylum	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 simpl 	 y 	 	not	what	our	 grand 	 est 	 	and	best	 institute 	 s 	 	of	 high 	 er 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	are	in	the	business	of	.
Why	?	 The 	 y 	 	do	n't	think	we	need	it	.
 The 	 y 	 	do	n't	think	we	are	in	an	 urge 	 nt 	 	need	of	 assist 	 ance 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	see	us	 a 	 s 	 	 adult 	 s 	 	,	rational	 adult 	 s 	 	.
What	we	need	is	information	.
We	need	data	,	we	do	n't	need	help	.
 N 	 ow 	 	 relig 	 ions 	 	start	from	a	 ver 	 y 	 	different	place	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	.
All	 relig 	 ions 	 	,	all	major	 relig 	 ions 	 	,	at	 vari 	 ous 	 	 point 	 s 	 	call	us	children	.
And	like	children	,	they	 believ 	 e 	 	that	we	are	in	severe	need	of	 assist 	 ance 	 	.
We	're	 on 	 ly 	 	just	 hold 	 ing 	 	it	together	.
 Per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	me	,	 may 	 be 	 	you	.
But	 any 	 way 	 	,	we	're	 on 	 ly 	 	just	 hold 	 ing 	 	it	together	.
And	we	need	help	.	Of	course	,	we	need	help	.
And	so	we	need	 gui 	 dance 	 	and	we	need	 did 	 act 	 ic 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	.
You	know	,	in	the	18th	century	in	the	 U. 	 K. 	 	,	the	 great 	 est 	 	 preach 	 er 	 	,	 great 	 est 	 	religious	 preach 	 er 	 	,	was	a	man	 call 	 ed 	 	John	 We 	 s 	 ley 	 	,	who	went	up	and	down	 th 	 is 	 	country	 deliver 	 ing 	 	 sermon 	 s 	 	,	 ad 	 vis 	 ing 	 	people	how	they	could	live	.
He	 deliver 	 ed 	 	 sermon 	 s 	 	on	the	 du 	 ties 	 	of	 parent 	 s 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	children	and	children	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	,	the	 du 	 ties 	 	of	the	rich	to	the	poor	and	the	poor	to	the	rich	.
He	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	tell	people	how	they	should	live	through	the	medium	of	 sermon 	 s 	 	,	the	classic	medium	of	 deliver 	 y 	 	of	 relig 	 ions 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	we	've	 give 	 n 	 	up	with	the	idea	of	 sermon 	 s 	 	.
If	you	 s 	 aid 	 	to	a	modern	liberal	 individual 	 ist 	 	,	``	Hey	,	how	about	a	sermon	?	''
they	'd	go	,	``	No	,	no	.	I	do	n't	need	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	.
I	'm	an	 in 	 dependent 	 	,	individual	person	.	''
What	's	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	a	sermon	and	our	modern	,	secular	mode	of	 deliver 	 y 	 	,	the	 lectur 	 e 	 	?
Well	a	sermon	 want 	 s 	 	to	change	your	life	and	a	 lectur 	 e 	 	 want 	 s 	 	to	give	you	a	bit	of	information	.
And	I	think	we	need	to	get	back	to	that	sermon	tradition	.
The	tradition	of	 sermon 	 izing 	 	is	 huge 	 ly 	 	 valu 	 able 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	are	in	need	of	 gui 	 dance 	 	,	 moral 	 ity 	 	and	 consol 	 ation 	 	--	and	 relig 	 ions 	 	know	that	.
 An 	 other 	 	point	about	education	:	we	tend	to	 believ 	 e 	 	in	the	modern	secular	world	that	if	you	tell	 some 	 one 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	once	,	they	'll	remember	it	.
Sit	them	in	a	 class 	 room 	 	,	tell	them	about	Plato	at	the	age	of	20	,	 s 	 end 	 	them	out	for	a	 care 	 er 	 	in	management	 consult 	 ancy 	 	for	40	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	that	 less 	 on 	 	will	stick	with	them	.
 Religion 	 s 	 	go	,	``	 Non 	 sense 	 	.
You	need	to	keep	 repeat 	 ing 	 	the	 less 	 on 	 	10	 time 	 s 	 	a	day	.
So	get	on	your	 knee 	 s 	 	and	repeat	it	.	''
That	's	what	all	 relig 	 ions 	 	tell	us	:	``	Get	on	you	 knee 	 s 	 	and	repeat	it	10	or	20	or	15	 time 	 s 	 	a	day	.	''
 Other 	 wise 	 	our	 mind 	 s 	 	are	like	 sieve 	 s 	 	.
So	 relig 	 ions 	 	are	 culture 	 s 	 	of	 re 	 petition 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	circle	the	great	 truth 	 s 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	and	 aga 	 in 	 	and	 aga 	 in 	 	.
We	associate	 re 	 petition 	 	with	 bore 	 dom 	 	.
``	 G 	 ive 	 	us	the	new	,	''	we	're	 al 	 ways 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	.
``	The	new	is	better	than	the	old	.	''
If	I	 s 	 aid 	 	to	you	,	``	 Oka 	 y 	 	,	we	're	not	going	to	have	new	TED	.
We	're	just	going	to	run	through	all	the	old	 one 	 s 	 	and	watch	them	five	 time 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	so	true	.
We	're	going	to	watch	Elizabeth	 Gil 	 bert 	 	five	 time 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	what	she	 say 	 s 	 	is	so	clever	,	''	you	'd	feel	 cheat 	 ed 	 	.
Not	so	if	you	're	 adopt 	 ing 	 	a	religious	 mind 	 set 	 	.
The	other	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 relig 	 ions 	 	do	is	to	arrange	time	.
All	the	major	 relig 	 ions 	 	give	us	 calendar 	 s 	 	.
What	is	a	calendar	?
A	calendar	is	a	way	of	making	 s 	 ure 	 	that	 a 	 cross 	 	the	year	you	will	bump	 in 	 to 	 	certain	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	.
In	the	Catholic	 chrono 	 logy 	 	,	Catholic	calendar	,	at	the	end	of	 Mar 	 ch 	 	you	will	think	about	 St 	 . 	 	 Jer 	 ome 	 	and	his	 qual 	 ities 	 	of	 humil 	 ity 	 	and	 good 	 ness 	 	and	his	 gene 	 ros 	 ity 	 	to	the	poor	.
You	wo	n't	do	that	by	accident	;	you	will	do	that	 be 	 cause 	 	you	are	 guide 	 d 	 	to	do	that	.
 N 	 ow 	 	we	do	n't	think	that	way	.
In	the	secular	world	we	think	,	``	If	an	idea	is	 import 	 ant 	 	,	I	'll	bump	 in 	 to 	 	it	.
I	'll	just	come	 a 	 cross 	 	it	.	''
 Non 	 sense 	 	,	 say 	 s 	 	the	religious	world	view	.
 Re 	 lig 	 ious 	 	view	 say 	 s 	 	we	need	 calendar 	 s 	 	,	we	need	to	structure	time	,	we	need	to	 synchron 	 ize 	 	 en 	 counter 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 come 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	 al 	 so 	 	in	the	way	in	which	 relig 	 ions 	 	set	up	 ritual 	 s 	 	around	 import 	 ant 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
Take	the	 Mo 	 on 	 	.	It	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	look	at	the	 Mo 	 on 	 	.
You	know	,	when	you	look	at	the	 Mo 	 on 	 	,	you	think	,	``	I	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	small	.	What	are	my	 problem 	 s 	 	?	''
It	 set 	 s 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	,	 etc 	 . 	 	,	etc	.
We	should	all	look	at	the	 Mo 	 on 	 	a	bit	more	often	.	We	do	n't	.
Why	do	n't	we	?	Well	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	tell	us	,	``	Look	at	the	 Mo 	 on 	 	.	''
But	if	you	're	a	Zen	Buddhist	in	the	middle	of	September	,	you	will	be	 order 	 ed 	 	out	of	your	home	,	made	to	stand	on	a	 can 	 on 	 ical 	 	platform	and	made	to	 celebr 	 ate 	 	the	 fest 	 ival 	 	of	Tsukimi	,	where	you	will	be	 give 	 n 	 	 poem 	 s 	 	to	read	in	honor	of	the	 Mo 	 on 	 	and	the	 pass 	 age 	 	of	time	and	the	 f 	 rail 	 ty 	 	of	life	that	it	should	 re 	 mind 	 	us	of	.
You	'll	be	 hand 	 ed 	 	rice	 cake 	 s 	 	.
And	the	 Mo 	 on 	 	and	the	 reflect 	 ion 	 	on	the	 Mo 	 on 	 	will	have	a	secure	place	in	your	heart	.
That	's	 ver 	 y 	 	good	.
The	other	thing	that	 relig 	 ions 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	aware	of	is	:	speak	well	--	I	'm	not	 do 	 ing 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	good	job	of	 th 	 is 	 	here	--	but	 or 	 atory 	 	,	 or 	 atory 	 	is	 absolute 	 ly 	 	key	to	 relig 	 ions 	 	.
In	the	secular	world	,	you	can	come	through	the	university	system	and	be	a	 lous 	 y 	 	speaker	and	still	have	a	great	 care 	 er 	 	.
But	the	religious	world	 do 	 es 	 	n't	think	that	way	.
What	you	're	 say 	 ing 	 	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	 back 	 ed 	 	up	by	a	 re 	 ally 	 	convincing	way	of	 say 	 ing 	 	it	.
So	if	you	go	to	an	African	American	 Pent 	 e 	 cost 	 alist 	 	church	in	the	American	South	and	you	listen	to	how	they	talk	,	my	 good 	 ness 	 	,	they	talk	well	.
After	every	convincing	point	,	people	will	go	,	``	 A 	 men 	 	,	 a 	 men 	 	,	 a 	 men 	 	.	''
At	the	end	of	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 r 	 ous 	 ing 	 	 para 	 graph 	 	,	they	'll	all	stand	up	,	and	they	'll	go	,	``	Thank	you	 Je 	 s 	 us 	 	,	thank	you	Christ	,	thank	you	 Sav 	 ior 	 	.	''
If	we	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	it	like	they	do	it	--	let	's	not	do	it	,	but	if	we	 we 	 re 	 	to	do	it	--	I	would	tell	you	 some 	 thing 	 	like	,	``	 Cultur 	 e 	 	should	replace	 script 	 ure 	 	.	''
And	you	would	go	,	``	 A 	 men 	 	,	 a 	 men 	 	,	 a 	 men 	 	.	''
And	at	the	end	of	my	talk	,	you	would	all	stand	up	and	you	would	go	,	``	Thank	you	Plato	,	thank	you	Shakespeare	,	thank	you	Jane	 Au 	 sten 	 	.	''
And	we	'd	know	that	we	had	a	real	rhythm	going	.
All	right	,	all	right	.	We	're	 get 	 ting 	 	there	.	We	're	 get 	 ting 	 	there	.
The	other	thing	that	 relig 	 ions 	 	know	is	we	're	not	just	 brain 	 s 	 	,	we	are	 al 	 so 	 	bodies	.
And	when	they	teach	us	a	 less 	 on 	 	,	they	do	it	via	the	body	.
So	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	take	the	 Jew 	 ish 	 	idea	of	 forgive 	 ness 	 	.
 Jew 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 forgive 	 ness 	 	and	how	we	should	start	 a 	 new 	 	and	start	 a 	 fresh 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	do	n't	just	deliver	us	 sermon 	 s 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	do	n't	just	give	us	 book 	 s 	 	or	 word 	 s 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	tell	us	to	have	a	bath	.
So	in	 Ortho 	 dox 	 	 Jew 	 ish 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	,	every	 Frida 	 y 	 	you	go	to	a	Mikveh	.
You	 immers 	 e 	 	 your 	 self 	 	in	the	water	,	and	a	physical	action	 back 	 s 	 	up	a	 philosoph 	 ical 	 	idea	.
We	do	n't	tend	to	do	that	.
Our	 idea 	 s 	 	are	in	one	area	and	our	behavior	with	our	bodies	is	in	 an 	 other 	 	.
 Religion 	 s 	 	are	 fasci 	 nating 	 	in	the	way	they	try	and	combine	the	two	.
Let	's	look	at	art	now	.
 N 	 ow 	 	art	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	in	the	secular	world	,	we	think	 ver 	 y 	 	 high 	 ly 	 	of	.	We	think	art	is	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
A	lot	of	our	 sur 	 plus 	 	wealth	 go 	 es 	 	to	 museum 	 s 	 	,	etc	.
We	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	hear	it	 s 	 aid 	 	that	 museum 	 s 	 	are	our	new	 cat 	 hedral 	 s 	 	,	or	our	new	 church 	 es 	 	.
You	've	heard	that	 say 	 ing 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	I	think	that	the	potential	is	there	,	but	we	've	 complete 	 ly 	 	let	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	down	.
And	the	reason	we	've	let	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	down	is	that	we	're	not	 proper 	 ly 	 	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	how	 relig 	 ions 	 	handle	art	.
The	two	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	 idea 	 s 	 	that	are	 hover 	 ing 	 	in	the	modern	world	that	inhibit	our	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	draw	strength	from	art	:	The	first	idea	is	that	art	should	be	for	art	's	sake	--	a	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	idea	--	an	idea	that	art	should	live	in	a	 her 	 me 	 tic 	 	bubble	and	should	not	try	to	do	 any 	 thing 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	 trouble 	 d 	 	world	.
I	could	n't	disagree	more	.
The	other	thing	that	we	 believ 	 e 	 	is	that	art	should	n't	explain	 it 	 self 	 	,	that	 artist 	 s 	 	should	n't	say	what	they	're	up	to	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	they	 s 	 aid 	 	it	,	it	might	destroy	the	spell	and	we	might	find	it	too	easy	.
That	's	why	a	 ver 	 y 	 	common	 feel 	 ing 	 	when	you	're	in	a	museum	--	let	's	admit	it	--	is	,	``	I	do	n't	know	what	 th 	 is 	 	is	about	.	''
But	if	we	're	serious	people	,	we	do	n't	admit	to	that	.
But	that	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	 puzzl 	 ement 	 	is	structural	to	 con 	 tempor 	 ary 	 	art	.
 N 	 ow 	 	 relig 	 ions 	 	have	a	much	 s 	 an 	 er 	 	attitude	to	art	.
 The 	 y 	 	have	no	trouble	 tell 	 ing 	 	us	what	art	is	about	.
Art	is	about	two	 thing 	 s 	 	in	all	the	major	 faith 	 s 	 	.
 First 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 re 	 mind 	 	you	of	what	there	is	to	love	.
And	 second 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 re 	 mind 	 	you	of	what	there	is	to	fear	and	to	hate	.
And	that	's	what	art	is	.
Art	is	a	visceral	 en 	 counter 	 	with	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	of	your	faith	.
So	 a 	 s 	 	you	walk	around	a	church	,	or	a	mosque	or	a	 cat 	 hedral 	 	,	what	you	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 imbib 	 e 	 	,	what	you	're	 imbib 	 ing 	 	is	,	through	your	 eye 	 s 	 	,	through	your	 sense 	 s 	 	,	 truth 	 s 	 	that	have	 other 	 wise 	 	come	to	you	through	your	mind	.
 Essential 	 ly 	 	it	's	 propag 	 and 	 a 	 	.
 Rem 	 brand 	 t 	 	is	a	 propag 	 and 	 ist 	 	in	the	 Christ 	 ian 	 	view	.
 N 	 ow 	 	the	word	``	 propag 	 and 	 a 	 	''	 set 	 s 	 	off	alarm	 bell 	 s 	 	.
We	think	of	 Hit 	 ler 	 	,	we	think	of	Stalin	.	Do	n't	,	 necess 	 arily 	 	.
 Pro 	 pagan 	 da 	 	is	a	manner	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 did 	 act 	 ic 	 	in	honor	of	 some 	 thing 	 	.
And	if	that	thing	is	good	,	there	's	no	problem	with	it	at	all	.
My	view	is	that	 museum 	 s 	 	should	take	a	leaf	out	of	the	book	of	 relig 	 ions 	 	.
And	they	should	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	when	you	walk	 in 	 to 	 	a	museum	--	if	I	was	a	museum	 cur 	 ator 	 	,	I	would	make	a	room	for	love	,	a	room	for	 gene 	 ros 	 ity 	 	.
All	 work 	 s 	 	of	art	are	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	us	about	 thing 	 s 	 	.
And	if	we	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	arrange	 space 	 s 	 	where	we	could	come	 a 	 cross 	 	 work 	 s 	 	where	we	would	be	told	,	use	these	 work 	 s 	 	of	art	to	cement	these	 idea 	 s 	 	in	your	mind	,	we	would	get	a	lot	more	out	of	art	.
Art	would	pick	up	the	duty	that	it	used	to	have	and	that	we	've	 neglect 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	certain	 mis 	 - 	 found 	 ed 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	.
Art	should	be	one	of	the	 tool 	 s 	 	by	which	we	improve	our	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
Art	should	be	 did 	 act 	 ic 	 	.
Let	's	think	of	 some 	 thing 	 	else	.
The	people	in	the	modern	world	,	in	the	secular	world	,	who	are	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 matter 	 s 	 	of	the	spirit	,	in	 matter 	 s 	 	of	the	mind	,	in	 high 	 er 	 	 soul 	 - 	 like 	 	 concern 	 s 	 	,	tend	to	be	 isolate 	 d 	 	 individual 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	 poet 	 s 	 	,	they	're	 philosoph 	 ers 	 	,	they	're	 photograph 	 ers 	 	,	they	're	 film 	 makers 	 	.
And	they	tend	to	be	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	our	cottage	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	.	 The 	 y 	 	are	 vulner 	 able 	 	,	single	people	.
And	they	get	 depress 	 ed 	 	and	they	get	 s 	 ad 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	.
And	they	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	change	much	.
 N 	 ow 	 	think	about	 relig 	 ions 	 	,	think	about	 organize 	 d 	 	 relig 	 ions 	 	.
What	do	 organize 	 d 	 	 relig 	 ions 	 	do	?
 The 	 y 	 	group	together	,	they	form	 institution 	 s 	 	.
And	that	 ha 	 s 	 	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 advantage 	 s 	 	.
First	of	all	,	scale	,	might	.
The	Catholic	Church	 pull 	 ed 	 	in	97	billion	 dollar 	 s 	 	last	year	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	the	Wall	Street	Journal	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	massive	 machine 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	 collabor 	 ative 	 	,	they	're	 brand 	 ed 	 	,	they	're	 multi 	 national 	 	,	and	they	're	 high 	 ly 	 	 discipline 	 d 	 	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	all	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 qual 	 ities 	 	.
We	 recogn 	 ize 	 	them	in	relation	to	 corporation 	 s 	 	.
And	 corporation 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	like	 relig 	 ions 	 	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	they	're	right	down	at	the	bottom	of	the	pyramid	of	 need 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	selling	us	 shoe 	 s 	 	and	 car 	 s 	 	.
 Where 	 a 	 s 	 	the	people	who	are	selling	us	the	 high 	 er 	 	stuff	--	the	 therapist 	 s 	 	,	the	 poet 	 s 	 	--	are	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	and	they	have	no	power	,	they	have	no	might	.
So	 relig 	 ions 	 	are	the	 fore 	 most 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	an	institution	that	is	 fight 	 ing 	 	for	the	 thing 	 s 	 	of	the	mind	.
 N 	 ow 	 	we	may	not	agree	with	what	 relig 	 ions 	 	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	teach	us	,	but	we	can	admire	the	 institution 	 al 	 	way	in	which	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
 Book 	 s 	 	 al 	 one 	 	,	 book 	 s 	 	written	by	lone	 individual 	 s 	 	,	are	not	going	to	change	 any 	 thing 	 	.
We	need	to	group	together	.
If	you	want	to	change	the	world	,	you	have	to	group	together	,	you	have	to	be	 collabor 	 ative 	 	.
And	that	's	what	 relig 	 ions 	 	do	.
 The 	 y 	 	are	 multi 	 national 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	I	say	,	they	are	 brand 	 ed 	 	,	they	have	a	clear	 ident 	 ity 	 	,	so	they	do	n't	get	lost	in	a	 bus 	 y 	 	world	.
That	's	 some 	 thing 	 	we	can	learn	from	.
I	want	to	conclude	.
 Re 	 ally 	 	what	I	want	to	say	is	for	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	who	are	 oper 	 ating 	 	in	a	range	of	different	 field 	 s 	 	,	there	is	 some 	 thing 	 	to	learn	from	the	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	 relig 	 ion 	 	--	even	if	you	do	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	any	of	it	.
If	you	're	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 any 	 thing 	 	that	's	 commun 	 al 	 	,	that	 involve 	 s 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	people	 get 	 ting 	 	together	,	there	are	 thing 	 s 	 	for	you	in	 relig 	 ion 	 	.
If	you	're	 involve 	 d 	 	,	say	,	in	a	travel	industry	in	any	way	,	look	at	 pil 	 grim 	 age 	 	.
Look	 ver 	 y 	 	 close 	 ly 	 	at	 pil 	 grim 	 age 	 	.
We	have	n't	 beg 	 un 	 	to	scratch	the	surface	of	what	travel	could	be	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	n't	 look 	 ed 	 	at	what	 relig 	 ions 	 	do	with	travel	.
If	you	're	in	the	art	world	,	look	at	the	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	what	 relig 	 ions 	 	are	 do 	 ing 	 	with	art	.
And	if	you	're	an	 educ 	 ator 	 	in	any	way	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	look	at	how	 relig 	 ions 	 	are	 spread 	 ing 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	.
You	may	not	agree	with	the	 idea 	 s 	 	,	but	my	 good 	 ness 	 	,	they	're	 high 	 ly 	 	effective	 mechan 	 ism 	 s 	 	for	 do 	 ing 	 	so	.
So	 re 	 ally 	 	my	 con 	 clud 	 ing 	 	point	is	you	may	not	agree	with	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	but	at	the	end	of	the	day	,	 relig 	 ions 	 	are	so	subtle	,	so	 complic 	 ated 	 	,	so	intelligent	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	that	they	're	not	fit	to	be	 abandon 	 ed 	 	to	the	religious	 al 	 one 	 	;	they	're	for	all	of	us	.
Thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
Chris	 And 	 er 	 son 	 	:	 N 	 ow 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 courage 	 ous 	 	talk	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	're	kind	of	setting	up	 your 	 self 	 	in	some	ways	to	be	 ridicul 	 ed 	 	in	some	 quarter 	 s 	 	.
AB	:	You	can	get	shot	by	both	 side 	 s 	 	.
You	can	get	shot	by	the	 hard 	 - 	 headed 	 	 atheist 	 s 	 	,	and	you	can	get	shot	by	 t 	 hose 	 	who	fully	 believ 	 e 	 	.
CA	:	 In 	 coming 	 	 mis 	 s 	 ile 	 s 	 	from	North	Oxford	at	any	moment	.
AB	:	 In 	 de 	 ed 	 	.
CA	:	But	you	left	out	one	 a 	 spect 	 	of	 relig 	 ion 	 	that	a	lot	of	people	might	say	your	agenda	could	borrow	from	,	which	is	 th 	 is 	 	sense	--	that	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	to	 any 	 one 	 	who	's	religious	--	of	spiritual	experience	,	of	some	kind	of	 connect 	 ion 	 	with	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	 big 	 ger 	 	than	you	are	.
 I 	 s 	 	there	any	room	for	that	experience	in	 A 	 theism 	 	2.0	?
AB	:	 Absolute 	 ly 	 	.	I	,	like	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	,	meet	people	who	say	 thing 	 s 	 	like	,	``	But	is	n't	there	 some 	 thing 	 	 big 	 ger 	 	than	us	,	And	I	say	,	``	Of	course	.	''	And	they	say	,	``	So	are	n't	you	sort	of	religious	?	''
And	I	go	,	``	No	.	''	Why	 do 	 es 	 	that	sense	of	 myster 	 y 	 	,	that	sense	of	the	 dizzy 	 ing 	 	scale	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	need	to	be	 accompani 	 ed 	 	by	a	 mystic 	 al 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	?
Science	and	just	 observ 	 ation 	 	 give 	 s 	 	us	that	 feel 	 ing 	 	 with 	 out 	 	it	,	so	I	do	n't	feel	the	need	.
The	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	large	and	we	are	 tin 	 y 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	the	need	for	further	religious	 super 	 structure 	 	.
So	one	can	have	 so 	 - 	 call 	 ed 	 	spiritual	 moment 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	belief	in	the	spirit	.
CA	:	 Actu 	 ally 	 	,	let	me	just	ask	a	question	.
How	 man 	 y 	 	people	here	would	say	that	 relig 	 ion 	 	is	 import 	 ant 	 	to	them	?
 I 	 s 	 	there	an	 equi 	 valent 	 	process	by	which	there	's	a	sort	of	bridge	between	what	you	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	and	what	you	would	say	to	them	?
AB	:	I	would	say	that	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 gap 	 s 	 	in	secular	life	and	these	can	be	 plug 	 ged 	 	.
It	's	not	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	I	try	to	suggest	,	it	's	not	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	either	you	have	 relig 	 ion 	 	and	then	you	have	to	accept	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	,	or	you	do	n't	have	 relig 	 ion 	 	and	then	you	're	cut	off	from	all	these	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 thing 	 s 	 	.
It	's	so	 s 	 ad 	 	that	we	 constant 	 ly 	 	say	,	``	I	do	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	so	I	ca	n't	have	community	,	so	I	'm	cut	off	from	 moral 	 ity 	 	,	so	I	ca	n't	go	on	a	 pil 	 grim 	 age 	 	.	''
One	 want 	 s 	 	to	say	,	``	 Non 	 sense 	 	.	Why	not	?	''
And	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	the	spirit	of	my	talk	.
There	's	so	much	we	can	absorb	.
 A 	 theism 	 	should	n't	cut	 it 	 self 	 	off	from	the	rich	 source 	 s 	 	of	 relig 	 ion 	 	.
CA	:	It	 seem 	 s 	 	to	me	that	there	's	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	people	in	the	TED	community	who	are	 atheist 	 s 	 	.
But	 prob 	 ably 	 	most	people	in	the	community	 certain 	 ly 	 	do	n't	think	that	 relig 	 ion 	 	is	going	away	any	time	soon	and	want	to	find	the	language	to	have	a	 construct 	 ive 	 	 dial 	 ogue 	 	and	to	feel	like	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	talk	to	each	other	and	at	 l 	 east 	 	share	some	 thing 	 s 	 	in	common	.
 A 	 re 	 	we	 fool 	 ish 	 	to	be	 optimist 	 ic 	 	about	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	a	world	where	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 relig 	 ion 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	the	great	 r 	 ally 	 ing 	 	cry	of	divide	and	war	,	that	there	could	be	 brid 	 ging 	 	?
AB	:	No	,	we	need	to	be	polite	about	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	.
 Poli 	 te 	 ness 	 	is	a	 much 	 - 	 overlook 	 ed 	 	virtue	.
It	's	 s 	 een 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 hypo 	 cri 	 s 	 y 	 	.
But	we	need	to	get	to	a	stage	when	you	're	an	atheist	and	 some 	 one 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	Well	you	know	,	I	did	pray	the	other	day	,	''	you	 polite 	 ly 	 	 ignor 	 e 	 	it	.
You	move	on	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	you	've	 agree 	 d 	 	on	90	percent	of	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	have	a	 share 	 d 	 	view	on	so	 man 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	you	 polite 	 ly 	 	differ	.
And	I	think	that	's	what	the	religious	 war 	 s 	 	of	late	have	 ignor 	 ed 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	've	 ignor 	 ed 	 	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	 harmon 	 ious 	 	 disagree 	 ment 	 	.
CA	:	And	 final 	 ly 	 	,	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	new	thing	that	you	're	 pro 	 posing 	 	that	's	not	a	 relig 	 ion 	 	but	 some 	 thing 	 	else	,	 do 	 es 	 	it	need	a	 lead 	 er 	 	,	and	are	you	 volunteer 	 ing 	 	to	be	the	 pop 	 e 	 	?
AB	:	Well	,	one	thing	that	we	're	all	 ver 	 y 	 	suspicious	of	is	individual	 lead 	 ers 	 	.
It	 do 	 es 	 	n't	need	it	.
What	I	've	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	lay	out	is	a	 frame 	 work 	 	and	I	'm	 hop 	 ing 	 	that	people	can	just	fill	it	in	.
I	've	 sketch 	 ed 	 	a	sort	of	broad	 frame 	 work 	 	.
But	 where 	 ver 	 	you	are	,	 a 	 s 	 	I	say	,	if	you	're	in	the	travel	industry	,	do	that	travel	bit	.
If	you	're	in	the	 commun 	 al 	 	industry	,	look	at	 relig 	 ion 	 	and	do	the	 commun 	 al 	 	bit	.
So	it	's	a	wiki	project	.

Can	you	tell	 every 	 body 	 	your	name	?
Einstein	:	Einstein	.
 S 	 W 	 	:	 Th 	 is 	 	is	Einstein	.	Can	you	tell	 every 	 one 	 	``	hi	''	?
E	:	 Hell 	 o 	 	.
 S 	 W 	 	:	That	's	nice	.	Can	you	be	polite	?
E	:	Hi	,	 sweet 	 heart 	 	.
 S 	 W 	 	:	 M 	 uch 	 	better	.	Well	,	Einstein	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 honor 	 ed 	 	to	be	here	at	TED	2006	,	 among 	 st 	 	all	you	 modern 	 - 	 day 	 	 Einstein 	 s 	 	.	In	fact	,	she	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	.
E	:	 Wo 	 o 	 	.
 S 	 W 	 	:	Yeah	.
Since	we	've	 arriv 	 ed 	 	,	there	's	 be 	 en 	 	a	constant	buzz	about	all	the	 excit 	 ing 	 	 speaker 	 s 	 	here	for	the	 con 	 ference 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	we	've	heard	a	lot	of	 whisper 	 s 	 	about	Tom	 Reil 	 ly 	 	's	 wrap 	 - 	 up 	 	on	Saturday	.	Einstein	,	did	you	hear	 whisper 	 s 	 	?
E	:	[	Squawks	]	 S 	 W 	 	:	Yeah	.
Einstein	's	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 Pen 	 elope 	 	's	talk	.
A	lot	of	her	research	 go 	 es 	 	on	in	 cave 	 s 	 	,	which	can	get	 pre 	 tty 	 	 dust 	 y 	 	.
E	:	 Ac 	 hoo 	 	!
 S 	 W 	 	:	It	could	make	her	 sneez 	 e 	 	.	But	more	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	her	research	could	help	Einstein	find	a	cure	for	her	 never 	 - 	 end 	 ing 	 	 scratch 	 y 	 	throat	.
Einstein	:	[	 C 	 ough 	 s 	 	]	 S 	 W 	 	:	Yeah	.
Well	,	Bob	 Rus 	 sell 	 	was	 tell 	 ing 	 	us	about	his	work	on	 nano 	 tube 	 s 	 	in	his	research	at	the	 micro 	 scopic 	 	level	.
Well	,	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	cool	,	but	what	Einstein	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 hop 	 ing 	 	is	that	 may 	 be 	 	he	'll	 genetic 	 ally 	 	engineer	a	 five 	 - 	 pound 	 	peanut	.
E	:	Oh	,	my	God	!	My	God	!	My	God	!
 S 	 W 	 	:	Yeah	.	She	would	get	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	.
That	is	one	big	peanut	.	Since	Einstein	is	a	bird	,	she	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 thing 	 s 	 	that	fly	.
She	 think 	 s 	 	 Bur 	 t 	 	 Ru 	 tan 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 impress 	 ive 	 	.
E	:	Ooh	.
 S 	 W 	 	:	Yeah	.	She	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 like 	 s 	 	his	 lat 	 est 	 	 achiev 	 ement 	 	,	 Space 	 Ship 	 One 	 	.
Einstein	,	would	you	like	to	ride	in	 Bur 	 t 	 	's	 space 	 ship 	 	?
E	:	[	 Space 	 ship 	 	noise	]	 S 	 W 	 	:	Even	if	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	a	laser	?
E	:	[	 La 	 s 	 er 	 	noise	]	 S 	 W 	 	:	Yeah	,	 yea 	 h 	 	.	That	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	funny	,	Einstein	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	Einstein	 al 	 so 	 	 think 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	 work 	 ing 	 	in	 cave 	 s 	 	and	 travel 	 ling 	 	through	space	--	it	's	all	 ver 	 y 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	 job 	 s 	 	.
It	would	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	if	you	fell	down	.
E	:	Wheeeeeee	!	[	 S 	 plat 	 	]	 S 	 W 	 	:	Yeah	.
 Li 	 ttle 	 	 s 	 plat 	 	at	the	end	there	.	Einstein	,	did	that	hurt	?
E	:	Ow	,	ow	,	ow	.
 S 	 W 	 	:	Yeah	.	It	's	all	a	lot	of	hard	work	.
E	:	[	Squawks	]	 S 	 W 	 	:	Yeah	.	It	can	get	a	bird	like	Einstein	 frust 	 rated 	 	.
E	:	[	Squawks	]	 S 	 W 	 	:	Yeah	,	it	 s 	 ure 	 	can	.	But	when	Einstein	 need 	 s 	 	to	relax	from	her	job	 educ 	 ating 	 	the	public	,	she	 love 	 s 	 	to	take	in	the	 art 	 s 	 	.
If	the	children	of	the	Uganda	need	 an 	 other 	 	dance	partner	,	Einstein	could	 s 	 ure 	 	fit	the	bill	,	 be 	 cause 	 	she	 love 	 s 	 	to	dance	.
Can	you	get	down	?
E	:	[	 Bob 	 bing 	 	head	]	 S 	 W 	 	:	Let	's	get	down	for	 every 	 body 	 	.	Come	on	now	.
She	's	going	to	make	me	do	it	,	too	.	Ooh	,	ooh	.
Einstein	:	Ooh	,	ooh	,	ooh	,	ooh	.
 S 	 W 	 	:	Do	your	head	now	.
E	:	Ooh	,	ooh	,	ooh	,	ooh	,	ooh	.
 S 	 W 	 	:	Or	 may 	 be 	 	 Siren 	 a 	 	 Hu 	 ang 	 	would	like	to	learn	some	 aria 	 s 	 	on	her	 viol 	 in 	 	,	and	Einstein	can	 s 	 ing 	 	 a 	 long 	 	with	some	opera	?
E	:	[	 Opera 	 tic 	 	squawk	]	 S 	 W 	 	:	 Ver 	 y 	 	good	.
Or	 may 	 be 	 	Stu	just	 need 	 s 	 	 an 	 other 	 	 back 	 up 	 	 s 	 ing 	 er 	 	?
Einstein	,	can	you	 al 	 so 	 	 s 	 ing 	 	?
I	know	,	you	need	to	get	rid	of	that	seed	first	.	Can	you	 s 	 ing 	 	?
E	:	La	,	la	.
 S 	 W 	 	:	There	you	go	.	And	,	of	course	,	if	all	else	 fail 	 s 	 	,	you	can	just	run	off	and	enjoy	a	 f 	 un 	 	 fi 	 esta 	 	.
E	:	[	Squawks	]	 S 	 W 	 	:	All	right	.	Well	,	Einstein	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	 embarrass 	 ed 	 	to	admit	 th 	 is 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	,	but	she	was	 tell 	 ing 	 	me	 back 	 stage 	 	that	she	had	a	problem	.
E	:	What	's	the	matter	?
 S 	 W 	 	:	No	,	I	do	n't	have	a	problem	.	You	have	the	problem	,	remember	?
You	 we 	 re 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	that	you	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 embarrass 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	're	in	love	with	a	pirate	?
E	:	 Ya 	 r 	 	.
 S 	 W 	 	:	There	you	go	.	And	what	do	 pirate 	 s 	 	like	to	drink	?
E	:	 Be 	 er 	 	.
 S 	 W 	 	:	Yeah	,	that	's	right	.	But	you	do	n't	like	to	drink	beer	,	Einstein	.
You	like	to	drink	water	.
E	:	[	Water	sound	]	 S 	 W 	 	:	 Ver 	 y 	 	good	.	 N 	 ow 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	she	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	nervous	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	one	of	her	 favor 	 ite 	 	 folk 	 s 	 	from	back	home	is	here	,	and	she	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	nervous	to	meet	him	.
She	 think 	 s 	 	Al	 Go 	 re 	 	is	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 good 	 - 	 looking 	 	man	.
What	do	you	say	to	a	 good 	 - 	 looking 	 	man	?
E	:	Hey	,	baby	.
 S 	 W 	 	:	And	so	do	all	the	 folk 	 s 	 	back	home	in	 Ten 	 ness 	 ee 	 	.
E	:	Yee	haw	.
 S 	 W 	 	:	And	since	she	's	 s 	 uch 	 	a	big	fan	,	she	 know 	 s 	 	that	his	 birth 	 day 	 	is	coming	up	at	the	end	of	 Mar 	 ch 	 	.
And	we	did	n't	think	he	'd	be	in	town	then	,	so	Einstein	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	special	for	him	.
So	let	's	see	if	Einstein	will	 s 	 ing 	 	``	 H 	 app 	 y 	 	 Birth 	 day 	 	''	to	Al	 Go 	 re 	 	.
Can	you	 s 	 ing 	 	``	 H 	 app 	 y 	 	 Birth 	 day 	 	''	to	him	?
E	:	 H 	 app 	 y 	 	 birth 	 day 	 	to	you	.
 S 	 W 	 	:	 Aga 	 in 	 	.
E	:	 H 	 app 	 y 	 	 birth 	 day 	 	to	you	.

E	:	 H 	 app 	 y 	 	 birth 	 day 	 	to	you	.
 S 	 W 	 	:	Good	job	!
Well	,	before	we	wrap	it	up	,	she	would	like	to	give	a	shout	out	to	all	our	animal	 friend 	 s 	 	back	at	the	 K 	 nox 	 ville 	 	Zoo	.
Einstein	,	do	you	want	to	say	``	hi	''	to	all	the	 owl 	 s 	 	?
E	:	 Wo 	 o 	 	,	 wo 	 o 	 	,	 wo 	 o 	 	.
 S 	 W 	 	:	What	about	the	other	 bird 	 s 	 	?
E	:	Tweet	,	tweet	,	tweet	.
 S 	 W 	 	:	And	the	penguin	?

Tim	 Fer 	 ris 	 s 	 	:	 S 	 mash 	 	fear	,	learn	 any 	 thing 	 
 Th 	 is 	 	is	Tim	 Fer 	 ris 	 s 	 	circa	1979	 A. 	 D. 	 	Age	two	.
You	can	tell	by	the	power	squat	,	I	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	confident	boy	--	and	not	 with 	 out 	 	reason	.
I	had	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 charm 	 ing 	 	routine	at	the	time	,	which	was	to	wait	 un 	 til 	 	late	in	the	 even 	 ing 	 	when	my	 parent 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 de 	 compress 	 ing 	 	from	a	hard	day	's	work	,	 do 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 cross 	 word 	 	 puzzl 	 es 	 	,	 watch 	 ing 	 	 tele 	 vision 	 	.
I	would	run	 in 	 to 	 	the	living	room	,	jump	up	on	the	couch	,	rip	the	 cushion 	 s 	 	off	,	throw	them	on	the	floor	,	 s 	 cream 	 	at	the	top	of	my	 lung 	 s 	 	and	run	out	 be 	 cause 	 	I	was	the	 In 	 credible 	 	 Hu 	 lk 	 	.
 Obvious 	 ly 	 	,	you	see	the	 re 	 semblance 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	routine	went	on	for	some	time	.
When	I	was	seven	I	went	to	summer	camp	.
My	 parent 	 s 	 	found	it	 necess 	 ary 	 	for	peace	of	mind	.
And	at	noon	each	day	the	 camp 	 ers 	 	would	go	to	a	pond	,	where	they	had	 float 	 ing 	 	 dock 	 s 	 	.
You	could	jump	off	the	end	 in 	 to 	 	the	deep	end	.
I	was	born	 pre 	 mature 	 	.	I	was	 al 	 ways 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	small	.
My	left	lung	had	 collapse 	 d 	 	when	I	was	born	.
And	I	've	 al 	 ways 	 	had	 buoy 	 ancy 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	.
So	water	was	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 scar 	 ed 	 	me	to	begin	with	.
But	I	would	go	in	on	occasion	.
And	on	one	 part 	 icular 	 	day	,	the	 camp 	 ers 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 jump 	 ing 	 	through	inner	 tube 	 s 	 	,	 The 	 y 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 div 	 ing 	 	through	inner	 tube 	 s 	 	.	And	I	thought	 th 	 is 	 	would	be	great	 f 	 un 	 	.
So	I	dove	through	the	inner	tube	,	and	the	 bull 	 y 	 	of	the	camp	 grab 	 bed 	 	my	 ankle 	 s 	 	.
And	I	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	come	up	for	air	,	and	my	lower	back	hit	the	bottom	of	the	inner	tube	.
And	I	went	wild	eyed	and	thought	I	was	going	to	die	.
A	camp	 counsel 	 or 	 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	came	over	and	 separat 	 ed 	 	us	.
From	that	point	 on 	 ward 	 	I	was	 terr 	 ified 	 	of	 swimm 	 ing 	 	.
That	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	I	did	not	get	over	.
My	 in 	 ability 	 	to	swim	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	one	of	my	 great 	 est 	 	 humil 	 iation 	 s 	 	and	 embarrass 	 ments 	 	.
That	is	when	I	 real 	 ized 	 	that	I	was	not	the	 In 	 credible 	 	 Hu 	 lk 	 	.
But	there	is	a	happy	 end 	 ing 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	story	.
At	age	31	--	that	's	my	age	now	--	in	 Au 	 gust 	 	I	took	two	 week 	 s 	 	to	 re 	 - 	 examine 	 	 swimm 	 ing 	 	,	and	question	all	the	of	the	obvious	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	of	 swimm 	 ing 	 	.
And	went	from	 swimm 	 ing 	 	one	lap	--	so	20	 yard 	 s 	 	--	like	a	 drown 	 ing 	 	monkey	,	at	about	200	 beat 	 s 	 	per	minute	heart	rate	--	I	 measur 	 ed 	 	it	--	to	going	to	 Mon 	 tau 	 k 	 	on	Long	Island	,	close	to	where	I	grew	up	,	and	 jump 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	ocean	and	 swimm 	 ing 	 	one	kilometer	in	open	water	,	 get 	 ting 	 	out	and	 feel 	 ing 	 	better	than	when	I	went	in	.
And	I	came	out	,	in	my	 Speed 	 os 	 	,	European	style	,	 feel 	 ing 	 	like	the	 In 	 credible 	 	 Hu 	 lk 	 	.
And	that	's	what	I	want	 every 	 one 	 	in	here	to	feel	like	,	the	 In 	 credible 	 	 Hu 	 lk 	 	,	at	the	end	of	 th 	 is 	 	 present 	 ation 	 	.
 Mo 	 re 	 	 specific 	 ally 	 	,	I	want	you	to	feel	like	you	're	 cap 	 able 	 	of	 be 	 coming 	 	an	 excel 	 lent 	 	 long 	 - 	 distance 	 	 swimm 	 er 	 	,	a	 world 	 - 	 class 	 	language	 learn 	 er 	 	,	and	a	 tan 	 go 	 	champion	.
And	I	would	like	to	share	my	art	.
If	I	have	an	art	,	it	's	 de 	 construct 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 care 	 	the	living	hell	out	of	me	.
So	,	moving	 on 	 ward 	 	.
 Swimm 	 ing 	 	,	first	 principle 	 s 	 	.
First	 principle 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
I	find	that	the	best	 result 	 s 	 	in	life	are	often	held	back	by	false	 construct 	 s 	 	and	 un 	 tested 	 	 assumption 	 s 	 	.
And	the	 turn 	 around 	 	in	 swimm 	 ing 	 	came	when	a	friend	of	mine	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	I	will	go	a	year	 with 	 out 	 	any	 stimul 	 ants 	 	''	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 six 	 - 	 double 	 - 	 espresso 	 - 	 per 	 - 	 day 	 	type	of	guy	--	``	if	you	can	complete	a	one	kilometer	open	water	race	.	''
So	the	clock	 start 	 ed 	 	 tick 	 ing 	 	.
I	 start 	 ed 	 	seeking	out	 tri 	 athlete 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	I	found	that	 life 	 long 	 	 swimm 	 ers 	 	often	could	n't	teach	what	they	did	.
I	 tri 	 ed 	 	 kick 	 board 	 s 	 	.
My	feet	would	slice	through	the	water	like	 razor 	 s 	 	,	I	would	n't	even	move	.	I	would	 leav 	 e 	 	 de 	 moralize 	 d 	 	,	 star 	 ing 	 	at	my	feet	.
Hand	 padd 	 les 	 	,	 every 	 thing 	 	.
Even	did	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	with	 Olymp 	 ians 	 	--	 noth 	 ing 	 	 help 	 ed 	 	.
And	then	Chris	Sacca	,	who	is	now	a	dear	friend	mine	,	had	 complete 	 d 	 	an	 Ir 	 on 	 	Man	with	103	degree	temperature	,	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	I	have	the	answer	to	your	 pray 	 ers 	 	.	''
And	he	 introduc 	 ed 	 	me	to	the	work	of	a	man	named	 Terr 	 y 	 	 Laugh 	 lin 	 	who	is	the	founder	of	Total	 Im 	 mer 	 s 	 ion 	 	 Swimm 	 ing 	 	.
That	set	me	on	the	road	to	 exa 	 min 	 ing 	 	 bio 	 mechanic 	 s 	 	.
So	here	are	the	new	 rule 	 s 	 	of	 swimm 	 ing 	 	,	if	any	of	you	are	 af 	 raid 	 	of	 swimm 	 ing 	 	,	or	not	good	at	it	.
The	first	is	,	forget	about	 kick 	 ing 	 	.	 Ver 	 y 	 	 counter 	 intuitive 	 	.
So	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	 pro 	 pulsion 	 	is	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	the	problem	.
 Kick 	 ing 	 	 hard 	 er 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	solve	the	problem	 be 	 cause 	 	the	average	 swimm 	 er 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	 transfer 	 s 	 	about	three	percent	of	 the 	 ir 	 	energy	 expend 	 iture 	 	 in 	 to 	 	forward	motion	.
The	problem	is	 hydro 	 dynamic 	 s 	 	.
So	what	you	want	to	focus	on	 in 	 stead 	 	is	 allow 	 ing 	 	your	lower	body	to	draft	 be 	 hind 	 	your	upper	body	,	much	like	a	small	car	 be 	 hind 	 	a	big	car	on	the	 high 	 way 	 	.
And	you	do	that	by	 maintain 	 ing 	 	a	 horizon 	 tal 	 	body	position	.
The	 on 	 ly 	 	way	you	can	do	that	is	to	not	swim	on	top	of	the	water	.
The	body	is	 den 	 s 	 er 	 	than	water	.	95	percent	of	it	would	be	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	,	 sub 	 merge 	 d 	 	 natural 	 ly 	 	.
So	you	end	up	,	number	three	,	not	 swimm 	 ing 	 	,	in	the	case	of	 free 	 style 	 	,	on	your	stomach	,	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	people	think	,	 reach 	 ing 	 	on	top	of	the	water	.
But	 actual 	 ly 	 	 rot 	 ating 	 	from	 stream 	 lined 	 	right	to	 stream 	 lined 	 	left	,	 maintain 	 ing 	 	that	 fuse 	 l 	 age 	 	position	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	possible	.
So	let	's	look	at	some	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	.	 Th 	 is 	 	is	 Terr 	 y 	 	.
And	you	can	see	that	he	's	 extend 	 ing 	 	his	right	arm	 be 	 low 	 	his	head	and	far	in	front	.
And	so	his	entire	body	 re 	 ally 	 	is	 under 	 water 	 	.
The	arm	is	 extend 	 ed 	 	 be 	 low 	 	the	head	.
The	head	is	held	in	line	with	the	 s 	 pine 	 	,	so	that	you	use	 strat 	 egic 	 	water	pressure	to	raise	your	 leg 	 s 	 	up	--	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	for	people	with	lower	body	fat	.
 He 	 re 	 	is	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	the	stroke	.
So	you	do	n't	kick	.	But	you	do	use	a	small	flick	.
You	can	see	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	left	 extens 	 ion 	 	.
 Th 	 en 	 	you	see	his	left	leg	.
Small	flick	,	and	the	 on 	 ly 	 	purpose	of	that	is	to	 rot 	 ate 	 	his	 hip 	 s 	 	so	he	can	get	to	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	side	.
And	the	entry	point	for	his	right	hand	--	notice	 th 	 is 	 	,	he	's	not	 reach 	 ing 	 	in	front	and	 catch 	 ing 	 	the	water	.
 Ra 	 ther 	 	,	he	is	 enter 	 ing 	 	the	water	at	a	45-degree	angle	with	his	 fore 	 arm 	 	,	and	then	 propel 	 ling 	 	 him 	 self 	 	by	 stream 	 lining 	 	--	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
 In 	 correct 	 	,	above	,	which	is	what	 al 	 most 	 	every	 swimm 	 ing 	 	coach	will	teach	you	.
Not	 the 	 ir 	 	fault	,	 honest 	 ly 	 	.
And	I	'll	get	to	 im 	 plicit 	 	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	 ex 	 plicit 	 	in	a	moment	.
 Be 	 low 	 	is	what	most	 swimm 	 ers 	 	will	find	 en 	 able 	 s 	 	them	to	do	what	I	did	,	which	is	going	from	21	 stroke 	 s 	 	per	20-yard	length	to	11	 stroke 	 s 	 	in	two	 work 	 out 	 s 	 	with	no	coach	,	no	video	 monitor 	 ing 	 	.
And	now	I	love	 swimm 	 ing 	 	.	I	ca	n't	wait	to	go	 swimm 	 ing 	 	.
I	'll	be	 do 	 ing 	 	a	 swimm 	 ing 	 	 less 	 on 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	for	 my 	 self 	 	,	if	 any 	 one 	 	 want 	 s 	 	to	join	me	.
Last	thing	,	 breath 	 ing 	 	.	A	problem	a	lot	of	us	have	,	 certain 	 ly 	 	,	when	you	're	 swimm 	 ing 	 	.
In	 free 	 style 	 	,	 eas 	 iest 	 	way	to	 re 	 med 	 y 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	to	turn	with	body	roll	,	and	just	to	look	at	your	 re 	 cover 	 y 	 	hand	 a 	 s 	 	it	 enter 	 s 	 	the	water	.
And	that	will	get	you	 ver 	 y 	 	far	.
That	's	it	.	That	's	 re 	 ally 	 	all	you	need	to	know	.
 Language 	 s 	 	.	Material	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	method	.
I	,	like	 man 	 y 	 	people	,	came	to	the	 con 	 clusion 	 	that	I	was	 terr 	 ible 	 	at	 language 	 s 	 	.
I	 suffer 	 ed 	 	through	 Spa 	 nish 	 	for	 juni 	 or 	 	high	,	first	year	of	high	school	,	and	the	sum	total	of	my	knowledge	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	,	``	 Don 	 de 	 	esta	el	 ban 	 o 	 	?	''
And	I	would	n't	even	catch	the	 respons 	 e 	 	.	A	 s 	 ad 	 	state	of	 af 	 fair 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 en 	 	I	 transfer 	 red 	 	to	a	different	school	 s 	 op 	 homo 	 re 	 	year	,	and	I	had	a	choice	of	other	 language 	 s 	 	.	 Mo 	 st 	 	of	my	 friend 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	taking	 Japan 	 ese 	 	.
So	I	thought	why	not	punish	 my 	 self 	 	?	I	'll	do	 Japan 	 ese 	 	.
Six	 month 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	I	had	the	chance	to	go	to	Japan	.
My	 teacher 	 s 	 	 assur 	 ed 	 	me	,	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Do	n't	worry	.
You	'll	have	 Japan 	 ese 	 	language	 class 	 es 	 	every	day	to	help	you	cope	.
It	will	be	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	experience	.	''	My	first	 over 	 sea 	 s 	 	experience	in	fact	.
So	my	 parent 	 s 	 	 encourag 	 ed 	 	me	to	do	it	.	I	left	.
I	 arriv 	 ed 	 	in	 To 	 kyo 	 	.	 Amaz 	 ing 	 	.
I	could	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	I	was	on	the	other	side	of	the	world	.
I	met	my	host	family	.	 Th 	 ing 	 s 	 	went	 quit 	 e 	 	well	I	think	,	all	 thing 	 s 	 	 consider 	 ed 	 	.
My	first	 even 	 ing 	 	,	before	my	first	day	of	school	,	I	 s 	 aid 	 	to	my	mother	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 polite 	 ly 	 	,	``	 P 	 lease 	 	wake	me	up	at	eight	a.m	.	''
So	,	But	I	did	n't	say	.	I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	.	 Pre 	 tty 	 	close	.
But	I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 P 	 lease 	 	rape	me	at	eight	a.m	.	''
You	've	never	 s 	 een 	 	a	more	 con 	 fused 	 	 Japan 	 ese 	 	woman	.
I	 walk 	 ed 	 	in	to	school	.
And	a	teacher	came	up	to	me	and	 hand 	 ed 	 	me	a	piece	of	paper	.
I	could	n't	read	any	of	it	--	hieroglyphics	,	it	could	have	 be 	 en 	 	--	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	Kanji	,	 Chi 	 nese 	 	 character 	 s 	 	 adapt 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 Japan 	 ese 	 	language	.
 Ask 	 ed 	 	him	what	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	.
And	he	 go 	 es 	 	,	``	 Ah 	 h 	 	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	eehto	,	World	 Hi 	 story 	 	,	ehh	,	 Calcul 	 us 	 	,	 Tradition 	 al 	 	 Japan 	 ese 	 	.	''	And	so	on	.
And	so	it	came	to	me	in	 wave 	 s 	 	.
There	had	 be 	 en 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	lost	in	 transl 	 ation 	 	.
The	 Japan 	 ese 	 	 class 	 es 	 	 we 	 re 	 	not	 Japan 	 ese 	 	 instruct 	 ion 	 	 class 	 es 	 	,	per	 s 	 e 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	 we 	 re 	 	the	normal	high	school	curriculum	for	 Japan 	 ese 	 	 student 	 s 	 	--	the	other	4,999	 student 	 s 	 	in	the	school	,	who	 we 	 re 	 	 Japan 	 ese 	 	,	 be 	 side 	 s 	 	the	American	.
And	that	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	my	 respons 	 e 	 	.
And	that	set	me	on	 th 	 is 	 	panic	driven	search	for	the	perfect	language	method	.
I	 tri 	 ed 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	.	I	went	to	Kinokuniya	.
I	 tri 	 ed 	 	every	possible	book	,	every	possible	CD	.
 No 	 thing 	 	 work 	 ed 	 	 un 	 til 	 	I	found	 th 	 is 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	 Jo 	 yo 	 	Kanji	.	 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	 T 	 able 	 t 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	,	or	a	 post 	 er 	 	of	the	1,945	 common 	 - 	 use 	 	 character 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 determine 	 d 	 	by	the	 Mini 	 stry 	 	of	 Educ 	 ation 	 	in	1981	.
 Man 	 y 	 	of	the	 public 	 ations 	 	in	Japan	limit	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	to	these	 character 	 s 	 	,	to	facilitate	 liter 	 acy 	 	--	some	are	 requir 	 ed 	 	to	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 came 	 	my	 Ho 	 ly 	 	 G 	 rail 	 	,	my	 Rose 	 tta 	 	Stone	.
 A 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	I	focused	on	 th 	 is 	 	material	,	I	took	off	.
I	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	read	 Asa 	 hi 	 	 Shin 	 bu 	 	,	 Asa 	 hi 	 	 news 	 paper 	 	,	about	six	 month 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	--	so	a	total	of	11	 month 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	--	and	went	from	 Japan 	 ese 	 	I	to	 Japan 	 ese 	 	 V 	 I 	 	.
 End 	 ed 	 	up	 do 	 ing 	 	 transl 	 ation 	 	work	at	age	16	when	I	 return 	 ed 	 	to	the	U.S.	,	and	have	 continu 	 ed 	 	to	 app 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	material	over	method	approach	to	close	to	a	dozen	 language 	 s 	 	now	.
 Some 	 one 	 	who	was	 terr 	 ible 	 	at	 language 	 s 	 	,	and	at	any	 give 	 n 	 	time	,	speak	,	read	and	write	five	or	six	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	us	to	the	point	,	which	is	,	it	's	 often 	 time 	 s 	 	what	you	do	,	not	how	you	do	it	,	that	is	the	 determi 	 ning 	 	factor	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	 be 	 ing 	 	effective	--	 do 	 ing 	 	the	right	 thing 	 s 	 	--	and	 be 	 ing 	 	efficient	--	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	well	 whet 	 her 	 	or	not	they	're	 import 	 ant 	 	.
You	can	 al 	 so 	 	do	 th 	 is 	 	with	 gram 	 mar 	 	.
I	came	up	with	these	six	 sentence 	 s 	 	after	much	 experiment 	 ation 	 	.
 Hav 	 ing 	 	a	native	speaker	allow	you	to	 de 	 construct 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 gram 	 mar 	 	,	by	 transl 	 ating 	 	these	 sentence 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	past	,	present	,	future	,	will	show	you	subject	,	object	,	verb	,	placement	of	 in 	 direct 	 	,	direct	 object 	 s 	 	,	gender	and	so	forth	.
From	that	point	,	you	can	then	,	if	you	want	to	,	 acquir 	 e 	 	 multi 	 ple 	 	 language 	 s 	 	,	alternate	them	so	there	is	no	 inter 	 ference 	 	.
We	can	talk	about	that	if	 any 	 one 	 	in	 interest 	 ed 	 	.
And	now	I	love	 language 	 s 	 	.
So	 ball 	 room 	 	 danc 	 ing 	 	,	 im 	 plicit 	 	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	 ex 	 plicit 	 	--	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
You	might	look	at	me	and	say	,	``	That	guy	must	be	a	 ball 	 room 	 	 danc 	 er 	 	.	''
But	no	,	you	'd	be	wrong	 be 	 cause 	 	my	body	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 poor 	 ly 	 	designed	for	most	 thing 	 s 	 	--	 pre 	 tty 	 	well	designed	for	 lift 	 ing 	 	heavy	 rock 	 s 	 	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	.
I	used	to	be	much	 big 	 ger 	 	,	much	more	 mus 	 cular 	 	.
And	so	I	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 walk 	 ing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
I	 look 	 ed 	 	a	lot	like	an	orangutan	,	our	close	 cousin 	 s 	 	,	or	the	 In 	 credible 	 	 Hu 	 lk 	 	.
Not	 ver 	 y 	 	good	for	 ball 	 room 	 	 danc 	 ing 	 	.
I	found	 my 	 self 	 	in	 Argentin 	 a 	 	in	2005	,	 decide 	 d 	 	to	watch	a	 tan 	 go 	 	class	--	had	no	 intent 	 ion 	 	of	 particip 	 ating 	 	.
 W 	 ent 	 	in	,	paid	my	ten	 peso 	 s 	 	,	 walk 	 ed 	 	up	--	10	women	two	 guy 	 s 	 	,	 usual 	 ly 	 	a	good	ratio	.
The	 instruct 	 or 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	You	are	 particip 	 ating 	 	.	''
 Im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	:	death	sweat	.
 Fight 	 - 	 or 	 - 	 flight 	 	fear	sweat	,	 be 	 cause 	 	I	 tri 	 ed 	 	 ball 	 room 	 	 danc 	 ing 	 	in	college	--	 steppe 	 d 	 	on	the	girl	's	foot	with	my	heel	.	She	 s 	 cream 	 ed 	 	.
I	was	so	 concern 	 ed 	 	with	her	 per 	 ception 	 	of	what	I	was	 do 	 ing 	 	,	that	it	 explode 	 d 	 	in	my	face	,	never	to	return	to	the	 ball 	 room 	 	 danc 	 ing 	 	club	.
She	 come 	 s 	 	up	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	was	her	approach	,	the	teacher	.
``	 Oka 	 y 	 	,	come	on	,	grab	me	.	''
 Gorge 	 ous 	 	 assist 	 ant 	 	 instruct 	 or 	 	.
She	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 piss 	 ed 	 	off	that	I	had	 pull 	 ed 	 	her	from	her	 advance 	 d 	 	practice	.
So	I	did	my	best	.	I	did	n't	know	where	to	put	my	 hand 	 s 	 	.
And	she	 pull 	 ed 	 	back	,	threw	down	her	 arm 	 s 	 	,	put	them	on	her	 hip 	 s 	 	,	 turn 	 ed 	 	around	and	 yell 	 ed 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	room	,	``	 Th 	 is 	 	guy	is	built	like	a	 god 	 - 	 damn 	 ed 	 	mountain	of	muscle	,	and	he	's	 grab 	 bing 	 	me	like	a	 fuck 	 ing 	 	 French 	 man 	 	,	''	which	I	found	 encourag 	 ing 	 	.
 Every 	 one 	 	burst	 in 	 to 	 	laughter	.	I	was	 humil 	 iated 	 	.
She	came	back	.	She	 go 	 es 	 	,	``	Come	on	.	I	do	n't	have	all	day	.	''
 A 	 s 	 	 some 	 one 	 	who	 wrestl 	 ed 	 	since	age	eight	,	I	 proceed 	 ed 	 	to	crush	her	,	``	Of	 M 	 ice 	 	and	Men	''	style	.
And	she	 look 	 ed 	 	up	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 N 	 ow 	 	that	's	better	.	''
So	I	 b 	 ought 	 	a	month	's	worth	of	 class 	 es 	 	.
And	 proceed 	 ed 	 	to	look	at	--	I	 want 	 ed 	 	to	set	 com 	 petition 	 	so	I	'd	have	a	 dead 	 line 	 	--	Parkinson	's	Law	,	the	 perceive 	 d 	 	 complex 	 ity 	 	of	a	task	will	expand	to	fill	the	time	you	 al 	 lot 	 	it	.
So	I	had	a	 ver 	 y 	 	short	 dead 	 line 	 	for	a	 com 	 petition 	 	.
I	got	a	female	 instruct 	 or 	 	first	,	to	teach	me	the	female	role	,	the	follow	,	 be 	 cause 	 	I	 want 	 ed 	 	to	understand	the	 sensitiv 	 ities 	 	and	abilities	that	the	follow	 need 	 ed 	 	to	develop	,	so	I	would	n't	have	a	repeat	of	college	.
And	then	I	took	an	 inventor 	 y 	 	of	the	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 long 	 	with	her	,	of	the	of	the	 cap 	 abilities 	 	and	 element 	 s 	 	of	different	 danc 	 ers 	 	who	'd	won	 champion 	 ship 	 s 	 	.
I	 interview 	 ed 	 	these	people	 be 	 cause 	 	they	all	taught	in	 Bueno 	 s 	 	 Air 	 es 	 	.
I	 compar 	 ed 	 	the	two	 list 	 s 	 	,	and	what	you	find	is	that	there	is	 ex 	 plicit 	 ly 	 	,	 expert 	 ise 	 	they	 recommend 	 ed 	 	,	certain	training	 method 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 en 	 	there	 we 	 re 	 	 im 	 plicit 	 	 common 	 al 	 ities 	 	that	 non 	 e 	 	of	them	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	be	 p 	 rac 	 tic 	 ing 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	the	 protect 	 ion 	 ism 	 	of	 Argentin 	 e 	 	dance	 teacher 	 s 	 	 a 	 side 	 	,	I	found	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.	So	I	 decide 	 d 	 	to	focus	on	three	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 common 	 al 	 ities 	 	.
Long	 step 	 s 	 	.	So	a	lot	of	 milo 	 ngueros 	 	--	the	 tan 	 go 	 	 danc 	 ers 	 	will	use	 ver 	 y 	 	short	 step 	 s 	 	.
I	found	that	 long 	 er 	 	 step 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	much	more	elegant	.
So	you	can	have	--	and	you	can	do	it	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	space	in	fact	.
 Second 	 ly 	 	,	different	 type 	 s 	 	of	 pivot 	 s 	 	.
 Thir 	 d 	 ly 	 	,	 vari 	 ation 	 	in	tempo	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	be	the	three	 area 	 s 	 	that	I	could	exploit	to	compete	if	I	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 com 	 pt 	 ete 	 	against	people	who	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 p 	 rac 	 tic 	 ing 	 	for	20	to	30	 year 	 s 	 	.
That	photo	is	of	the	 semi 	 - 	 final 	 s 	 	of	the	 Bueno 	 s 	 	 Air 	 es 	 	 champion 	 ship 	 s 	 	,	four	 month 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	.
 Th 	 en 	 	one	month	 lat 	 er 	 	,	went	to	the	world	 champion 	 ship 	 s 	 	,	made	it	to	the	 semi 	 - 	 final 	 	.	And	then	set	a	world	record	,	 follow 	 ing 	 	that	,	two	 week 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	.
I	want	you	to	see	part	of	what	I	 practice 	 d 	 	.
I	'm	going	to	jump	forward	here	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	 instruct 	 or 	 	that	 Ali 	 cia 	 	and	I	chose	for	the	male	lead	.
 Hi 	 s 	 	name	is	Gabriel	 Miss 	 e 	 	.
One	of	the	most	elegant	 danc 	 ers 	 	of	his	generation	,	known	for	his	long	 step 	 s 	 	,	and	his	tempo	 change 	 s 	 	and	his	 pivot 	 s 	 	.
 Ali 	 cia 	 	,	in	her	own	right	,	 ver 	 y 	 	famous	.
So	I	think	you	'll	agree	,	they	look	 quit 	 e 	 	good	together	.
 N 	 ow 	 	what	I	like	about	 th 	 is 	 	video	is	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	video	of	the	first	time	they	ever	 danc 	 ed 	 	together	 be 	 cause 	 	of	his	lead	.	He	had	a	strong	lead	.
He	did	n't	lead	with	his	chest	,	which	 requir 	 es 	 	you	lean	forward	.
I	could	n't	develop	the	 attribut 	 es 	 	in	my	 to 	 es 	 	,	the	strength	in	my	feet	,	to	do	that	.
So	he	uses	a	lead	that	 focus 	 es 	 	on	his	shoulder	 gird 	 le 	 	and	his	arm	.
So	he	can	lift	the	woman	to	break	her	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
That	's	just	one	benefit	of	that	.
So	then	we	broke	it	down	.
 Th 	 is 	 	would	be	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	one	pivot	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	back	step	pivot	.
There	are	 man 	 y 	 	different	 type 	 s 	 	.
I	have	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 hour 	 s 	 	of	 foot 	 age 	 	--	all	 categor 	 ized 	 	,	much	like	George	 Carl 	 in 	 	 categor 	 ized 	 	his	 come 	 dy 	 	.
So	using	my	 arch 	 - 	 nemesis 	 	,	 Spa 	 nish 	 	,	no	less	,	to	learn	 tan 	 go 	 	.
So	fear	is	your	friend	.	Fear	is	an	 indic 	 ator 	 	.
 Some 	 time 	 s 	 	it	 show 	 s 	 	you	what	you	should	n't	do	.
 Mo 	 re 	 	often	than	not	it	 show 	 s 	 	you	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	you	should	do	.
And	the	best	 result 	 s 	 	that	I	've	had	in	life	,	the	most	 enjoy 	 able 	 	 time 	 s 	 	,	have	all	 be 	 en 	 	from	 ask 	 ing 	 	a	simple	question	:	what	's	the	worst	that	can	happen	?
 E 	 special 	 ly 	 	with	 fear 	 s 	 	you	 gain 	 ed 	 	when	you	 we 	 re 	 	a	child	.
Take	the	 analytic 	 al 	 	 frame 	 work 	 s 	 	,	the	 cap 	 abilities 	 	you	have	,	 app 	 ly 	 	them	to	old	 fear 	 s 	 	.
 App 	 ly 	 	them	to	 ver 	 y 	 	big	 dream 	 s 	 	.
And	when	I	think	of	what	I	fear	now	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	.
When	I	imagine	my	life	,	what	my	life	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	like	 with 	 out 	 	the	 education 	 al 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	that	I	had	,	it	 make 	 s 	 	me	wonder	.
I	've	 s 	 pent 	 	the	last	two	 year 	 s 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 de 	 construct 	 	the	American	public	school	system	,	to	either	fix	it	or	replace	it	.
And	have	 d 	 one 	 	 experiment 	 s 	 	with	about	50,000	 student 	 s 	 	thus	far	--	built	,	I	'd	say	,	about	a	half	dozen	 school 	 s 	 	,	my	 read 	 ers 	 	,	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	.
And	if	any	of	you	are	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	that	,	I	would	love	to	speak	with	you	.
I	know	 noth 	 ing 	 	.	I	'm	a	 beg 	 inner 	 	.
But	I	ask	a	lot	of	 question 	 s 	 	,	and	I	would	love	your	 ad 	 vice 	 	.
Thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.

 Geo 	 ff 	 	 Mul 	 gan 	 	:	A	short	intro	to	the	Studio	School
What	I	want	to	talk	about	 to 	 day 	 	is	one	idea	.
It	's	an	idea	for	a	new	kind	of	school	,	which	 turn 	 s 	 	on	 it 	 s 	 	head	much	of	our	 convention 	 al 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	what	 school 	 s 	 	are	for	and	how	they	work	.
And	it	might	just	be	coming	to	a	 neighbor 	 hood 	 	near	you	soon	.
Where	it	 come 	 s 	 	from	is	an	 organ 	 ization 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	Young	 Found 	 ation 	 	,	which	,	over	 man 	 y 	 	 decade 	 s 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	come	up	with	 man 	 y 	 	 innov 	 ations 	 	in	education	,	like	the	Open	 Univers 	 ity 	 	and	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 Ex 	 tend 	 ed 	 	 School 	 s 	 	,	 School 	 s 	 	for	 So 	 cial 	 	Entrepreneurs	,	 Summ 	 er 	 	 Univers 	 ities 	 	and	the	School	of	 Every 	 thing 	 	.
And	about	five	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	we	 ask 	 ed 	 	what	was	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	need	for	 innov 	 ation 	 	in	 school 	 ing 	 	here	in	the	 U. 	 K 	 	.
And	we	felt	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 prior 	 ity 	 	was	to	 br 	 ing 	 	together	two	 set 	 s 	 	of	 problem 	 s 	 	.
One	was	large	 number 	 s 	 	of	 bor 	 ed 	 	 teenager 	 s 	 	who	just	did	n't	like	school	,	could	n't	see	any	relationship	between	what	they	 learn 	 ed 	 	in	school	and	future	 job 	 s 	 	.
And	 employ 	 ers 	 	who	 ke 	 pt 	 	 complain 	 ing 	 	that	the	 kid 	 s 	 	coming	out	of	school	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	ready	for	real	work	,	did	n't	have	the	right	 attitude 	 s 	 	and	experience	.
And	so	we	try	to	ask	:	What	kind	of	school	would	have	the	 teenager 	 s 	 	 fight 	 ing 	 	to	get	in	,	not	 fight 	 ing 	 	to	stay	out	?
And	after	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 conversation 	 s 	 	with	 teenager 	 s 	 	and	 teacher 	 s 	 	and	 parent 	 s 	 	and	 employ 	 ers 	 	and	 school 	 s 	 	from	 Parag 	 uay 	 	to	Australia	,	and	looking	at	some	of	the	academic	research	,	which	 show 	 ed 	 	the	 import 	 ance 	 	of	what	's	now	 call 	 ed 	 	 non 	 - 	 cognitive 	 	 skill 	 s 	 	--	the	 skill 	 s 	 	of	 motiv 	 ation 	 	,	 resili 	 ence 	 	--	and	that	these	are	 a 	 s 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	cognitive	 skill 	 s 	 	--	 form 	 al 	 	academic	 skill 	 s 	 	--	we	came	up	with	an	answer	,	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	answer	in	a	way	,	which	we	 call 	 ed 	 	the	Studio	School	.
And	we	 call 	 ed 	 	it	a	studio	school	to	go	back	to	the	original	idea	of	a	studio	in	the	 Ren 	 aiss 	 ance 	 	where	work	and	 learn 	 ing 	 	are	 integrate 	 d 	 	.
You	work	by	 learn 	 ing 	 	,	and	you	learn	by	 work 	 ing 	 	.
And	the	design	we	came	up	with	had	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	.
First	of	all	,	we	 want 	 ed 	 	small	 school 	 s 	 	--	about	300	,	400	 pupil 	 s 	 	--	14	to	19	 year 	 - 	 olds 	 	,	and	 critical 	 ly 	 	,	about	80	percent	of	the	curriculum	 d 	 one 	 	not	through	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	in	 class 	 rooms 	 	,	but	through	 real 	 - 	 life 	 	,	practical	 project 	 s 	 	,	 work 	 ing 	 	on	commission	to	 business 	 es 	 	,	 NG 	 O 	 	's	and	 other 	 s 	 	.
That	every	pupil	would	have	a	coach	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	 teacher 	 s 	 	,	who	would	have	 time 	 table 	 s 	 	much	more	like	a	work	environment	in	a	business	.
And	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	will	be	 d 	 one 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	public	system	,	funded	by	public	money	,	but	 in 	 dependent 	 ly 	 	run	.
And	all	at	no	extra	cost	,	no	 s 	 election 	 	,	and	 allow 	 ing 	 	the	 pupil 	 s 	 	the	route	 in 	 to 	 	university	,	even	if	 man 	 y 	 	of	them	would	want	to	 be 	 come 	 	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	and	have	manual	 job 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
 Under 	 ly 	 ing 	 	it	was	some	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 idea 	 s 	 	that	large	 number 	 s 	 	of	 teenager 	 s 	 	learn	best	by	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	they	learn	best	in	 team 	 s 	 	and	they	learn	best	by	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	for	real	--	all	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	of	what	 main 	 stream 	 	 school 	 ing 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 do 	 es 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	that	was	a	nice	idea	,	so	we	 move 	 d 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	rapid	 proto 	 ty 	 ping 	 	phase	.
We	 tri 	 ed 	 	it	out	,	first	in	 Lu 	 ton 	 	--	famous	for	 it 	 s 	 	 air 	 port 	 	and	not	much	else	,	I	fear	--	and	in	 Black 	 pool 	 	--	famous	for	 it 	 s 	 	 beach 	 es 	 	and	leisure	.
And	what	we	found	--	and	we	got	 quit 	 e 	 	a	lot	of	 thing 	 s 	 	wrong	and	then	 improv 	 ed 	 	them	--	but	we	found	that	the	young	people	 love 	 d 	 	it	.
 The 	 y 	 	found	it	much	more	 motiv 	 ation 	 al 	 	,	much	more	 excit 	 ing 	 	than	 tradition 	 al 	 	education	.
And	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	most	 import 	 ant 	 	of	all	,	two	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	when	the	 ex 	 am 	 	 result 	 s 	 	came	through	,	the	 pupil 	 s 	 	who	had	 be 	 en 	 	put	on	these	field	 trial 	 s 	 	who	 we 	 re 	 	in	the	 low 	 est 	 	 perform 	 ing 	 	 group 	 s 	 	had	 jump 	 ed 	 	right	to	the	top	--	in	fact	,	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	at	the	top	 dec 	 ile 	 	of	performance	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	GCSE	's	,	which	is	the	 Brit 	 ish 	 	 mark 	 ing 	 	system	.
 N 	 ow 	 	not	 surprising 	 ly 	 	,	that	 influence 	 d 	 	some	people	to	think	we	 we 	 re 	 	onto	 some 	 thing 	 	.
The	 mini 	 ster 	 	of	education	down	south	in	London	 de 	 scribed 	 	 him 	 self 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	``	big	fan	.	''
And	the	business	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	thought	we	 we 	 re 	 	onto	 some 	 thing 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	a	way	of	 pre 	 par 	 ing 	 	children	much	better	for	 real 	 - 	 life 	 	work	 to 	 day 	 	.
And	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	the	head	of	the	 Chamber 	 s 	 	of	 Comm 	 er 	 ce 	 	is	now	the	 chair 	 man 	 	of	the	Studio	 School 	 s 	 	Trust	and	 help 	 ing 	 	it	,	not	just	with	big	 business 	 es 	 	,	but	small	 business 	 es 	 	all	over	the	country	.
We	 start 	 ed 	 	with	two	 school 	 s 	 	.
That	's	grown	 th 	 is 	 	year	to	about	10	.
And	next	year	,	we	're	 expect 	 ing 	 	about	35	 school 	 s 	 	open	 a 	 cross 	 	 Eng 	 land 	 	,	and	 an 	 other 	 	40	 area 	 s 	 	want	to	have	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 school 	 s 	 	 open 	 ing 	 	--	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	rapid	spread	of	 th 	 is 	 	idea	.
 Inter 	 est 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	 al 	 most 	 	 entire 	 ly 	 	 with 	 out 	 	media	 cover 	 age 	 	.
It	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	 al 	 most 	 	 entire 	 ly 	 	 with 	 out 	 	big	money	 be 	 hind 	 	it	.
It	spread	 al 	 most 	 	 entire 	 ly 	 	through	word	of	mouth	,	 viral 	 ly 	 	,	 a 	 cross 	 	 teacher 	 s 	 	,	 parent 	 s 	 	,	people	 involve 	 d 	 	in	education	.
And	it	spread	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	power	of	an	idea	--	so	the	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	idea	about	 turn 	 ing 	 	education	on	 it 	 s 	 	head	and	 put 	 ting 	 	the	 thing 	 s 	 	which	 we 	 re 	 	marginal	,	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 work 	 ing 	 	in	 team 	 s 	 	,	 do 	 ing 	 	practical	 project 	 s 	 	,	and	 put 	 ting 	 	them	right	at	the	heart	of	 learn 	 ing 	 	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	on	the	 edge 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	there	's	a	whole	set	of	new	 school 	 s 	 	 open 	 ing 	 	up	 th 	 is 	 	 aut 	 umn 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	one	from	 York 	 s 	 hire 	 	where	,	in	fact	,	my	nephew	,	I	hope	,	will	be	able	to	attend	it	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	one	is	focused	on	creative	and	media	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	.
Other	 one 	 s 	 	have	a	focus	on	health	care	,	 tour 	 ism 	 	,	 engineer 	 ing 	 	and	other	 field 	 s 	 	.
We	think	we	're	onto	 some 	 thing 	 	.
It	's	not	perfect	yet	,	but	we	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	idea	which	can	transform	the	 live 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	,	possibly	 million 	 s 	 	,	of	 teenager 	 s 	 	who	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 bor 	 ed 	 	by	 school 	 ing 	 	.
It	 do 	 es 	 	n't	animate	them	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	not	like	all	of	you	who	can	 s 	 it 	 	in	 row 	 s 	 	and	hear	 thing 	 s 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	to	you	for	hour	after	hour	.
 The 	 y 	 	want	to	do	 thing 	 s 	 	,	they	want	to	get	 the 	 ir 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	 dirt 	 y 	 	,	they	want	education	to	be	for	real	.
And	my	hope	is	that	some	of	you	out	there	may	be	able	to	help	us	.
We	feel	we	're	on	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	a	journey	of	experiment	and	 improve 	 ment 	 	to	turn	the	Studio	School	idea	 in 	 to 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	which	is	present	,	not	 a 	 s 	 	a	universal	answer	for	every	child	,	but	at	 l 	 east 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	answer	for	some	children	in	every	part	of	the	world	.
And	I	hope	that	a	few	of	you	at	 l 	 east 	 	can	help	us	make	that	happen	.
Thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.

 Jim 	 my 	 	 Wal 	 es 	 	on	the	birth	of	Wikipedia
In	1962	,	 Char 	 les 	 	Van	 Do 	 ren 	 	,	who	was	 lat 	 er 	 	a	senior	editor	of	 Brit 	 annica 	 	,	 s 	 aid 	 	the	ideal	encyclopedia	should	be	radical	--	it	should	stop	 be 	 ing 	 	safe	.
But	if	you	know	 any 	 thing 	 	about	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 Brit 	 annica 	 	since	1962	,	it	was	 any 	 thing 	 	but	radical	:	still	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	safe	,	stodgy	type	of	encyclopedia	.
Wikipedia	,	on	the	other	hand	,	 begin 	 s 	 	with	a	 ver 	 y 	 	radical	idea	,	and	that	's	for	all	of	us	to	imagine	a	world	in	which	every	single	person	on	the	planet	is	 give 	 n 	 	free	access	to	the	sum	of	all	human	knowledge	.
And	that	's	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	.	So	Wikipedia	--	you	just	saw	the	little	 demonst 	 ration 	 	of	it	--	it	's	a	 free 	 ly 	 	 licens 	 ed 	 	encyclopedia	.	It	's	written	by	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 volunteer 	 s 	 	all	over	the	world	in	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 language 	 s 	 	.
It	's	written	using	Wiki	 soft 	 ware 	 	--	which	is	the	type	of	 soft 	 ware 	 	he	just	 demonst 	 rated 	 	--	so	 any 	 one 	 	can	 quick 	 ly 	 	edit	and	 s 	 ave 	 	,	and	it	 go 	 es 	 	live	on	the	Internet	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	.
And	 every 	 thing 	 	about	Wikipedia	is	 manage 	 d 	 	by	 virtual 	 ly 	 	an	 all 	 - 	 volunteer 	 	staff	.
So	when	 Yo 	 chai 	 	is	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	new	 method 	 s 	 	of	 organ 	 ization 	 	,	he	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	 de 	 s 	 crib 	 ing 	 	Wikipedia	.	And	what	I	'm	going	to	do	 to 	 day 	 	is	tell	you	a	little	bit	more	about	how	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 work 	 s 	 	on	the	 in 	 side 	 	.
So	Wikipedia	's	owned	by	the	 Wiki 	 media 	 	 Found 	 ation 	 	,	which	I	 found 	 ed 	 	,	a	 non 	 profit 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 	.	And	our	goal	,	the	core	aim	of	the	 Wiki 	 media 	 	 Found 	 ation 	 	,	is	to	get	a	free	encyclopedia	to	every	single	person	on	the	planet	.
And	so	if	you	think	about	what	that	 mean 	 s 	 	,	it	 mean 	 s 	 	a	lot	more	than	just	building	a	cool	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	.
We	're	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	all	the	 issue 	 s 	 	of	the	digital	divide	,	poverty	 world 	 wide 	 	,	 empower 	 ing 	 	people	 every 	 where 	 	to	have	the	information	that	they	need	to	make	good	 decision 	 s 	 	.
And	so	we	're	going	to	have	to	do	a	lot	of	work	that	 go 	 es 	 	beyond	just	the	Internet	.
And	so	that	's	a	big	part	of	why	we	've	 chose 	 n 	 	the	free	 licens 	 ing 	 	model	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	 empower 	 s 	 	local	 entrepreneur 	 s 	 	--	or	 any 	 one 	 	who	 want 	 s 	 	to	,	can	take	our	content	and	do	 any 	 thing 	 	they	like	with	it	--	you	can	copy	it	,	 re 	 distribut 	 e 	 	it	and	you	can	do	it	 commercial 	 ly 	 	or	 non 	 - 	 commercial 	 ly 	 	.
So	there	's	a	lot	of	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	that	are	going	to	arise	around	Wikipedia	all	over	the	world	.
We	're	funded	by	 don 	 ations 	 	from	the	public	,	and	one	of	the	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	about	that	is	how	little	money	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 take 	 s 	 	to	run	Wikipedia	.
So	 Yo 	 chai 	 	 show 	 ed 	 	you	the	graph	of	what	the	cost	of	a	 print 	 ing 	 	press	was	.
And	I	'm	going	to	tell	you	what	the	cost	of	Wikipedia	is	,	but	first	I	'll	show	you	how	big	it	is	.
So	we	've	got	over	600,000	 article 	 s 	 	in	English	.
We	've	got	two	million	total	 article 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	different	 language 	 s 	 	.
The	 big 	 gest 	 	 language 	 s 	 	are	German	,	 Japan 	 ese 	 	,	French	--	all	the	Western	European	 language 	 s 	 	are	 quit 	 e 	 	big	.
But	 on 	 ly 	 	around	 one 	 - 	 third 	 	of	all	of	our	traffic	to	our	web	 cluster 	 s 	 	to	the	English	Wikipedia	,	which	is	surprising	to	a	lot	of	people	.
A	lot	of	people	think	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 English 	 - 	 centric 	 	way	on	the	Internet	,	but	for	us	,	we	're	 tru 	 ly 	 	global	.	We	're	in	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 language 	 s 	 	.
How	popular	we	've	gotten	to	be	--	we	're	a	top	50	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	and	we	're	more	popular	than	the	New	York	 Time 	 s 	 	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	we	get	to	 Yo 	 chai 	 	's	 discuss 	 ion 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 show 	 s 	 	the	growth	of	Wikipedia	--	we	're	the	blue	line	there	--	and	then	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	New	York	 Time 	 s 	 	over	there	.
And	what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	New	York	 Time 	 s 	 	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	is	a	huge	,	enormous	corporate	operation	with	--	I	have	no	idea	how	 man 	 y 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 employ 	 ees 	 	.
We	have	 exact 	 ly 	 	one	 employ 	 ee 	 	,	and	that	 employ 	 ee 	 	is	our	lead	 soft 	 ware 	 	 develop 	 er 	 	.
And	he	's	 on 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	our	 employ 	 ee 	 	since	 Jan 	 uary 	 	2005	,	all	the	other	growth	before	that	.
So	the	 serv 	 ers 	 	are	 manage 	 d 	 	by	a	 rag 	 - 	 tag 	 	band	of	 volunteer 	 s 	 	;	all	the	 edit 	 ing 	 	is	 d 	 one 	 	by	 volunteer 	 s 	 	.
And	the	way	that	we	're	 organize 	 d 	 	is	not	like	any	 tradition 	 al 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 	you	can	imagine	.
People	are	 al 	 ways 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	,	``	Well	,	who	's	in	charge	of	 th 	 is 	 	?	''
or	``	Who	 do 	 es 	 	that	?	''	And	the	answer	is	:	 any 	 body 	 	who	 want 	 s 	 	to	pitch	in	.
It	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 usual 	 	and	chaotic	thing	.
We	've	got	over	90	 serv 	 ers 	 	now	in	three	 location 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	 manage 	 d 	 	by	volunteer	system	 administr 	 ators 	 	who	are	 on 	 line 	 	.
I	can	go	 on 	 line 	 	any	time	of	the	day	or	night	and	see	eight	to	10	people	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	me	to	ask	a	question	or	 some 	 thing 	 	,	 any 	 thing 	 	about	the	 serv 	 ers 	 	.
You	could	never	afford	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	in	a	company	.
You	could	never	afford	to	have	a	 stand 	 by 	 	crew	of	people	24	 hour 	 s 	 	a	day	and	do	what	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	at	Wikipedia	.
So	we	're	 do 	 ing 	 	around	1.4	billion	page	 view 	 s 	 	 month 	 ly 	 	,	so	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	gotten	to	be	a	huge	thing	.
And	 every 	 thing 	 	is	 manage 	 d 	 	by	the	 volunteer 	 s 	 	.
And	the	total	 month 	 ly 	 	cost	for	our	 band 	 width 	 	is	about	5,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
And	that	's	 essential 	 ly 	 	our	main	cost	.
We	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	 with 	 out 	 	the	 employ 	 ee 	 	.	We	 actual 	 ly 	 	--	we	 hire 	 d 	 	 Br 	 ian 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	he	was	 work 	 ing 	 	 part 	 - 	 time 	 	for	two	 year 	 s 	 	and	 full 	 - 	 time 	 	at	Wikipedia	,	so	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	 hire 	 d 	 	him	so	he	could	get	a	life	and	go	to	the	 movie 	 s 	 	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	.
So	the	big	question	when	you	've	got	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	chaotic	 organ 	 ization 	 	is	,	why	is	n't	it	all	 rub 	 b 	 ish 	 	?	Why	is	the	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	 a 	 s 	 	good	 a 	 s 	 	it	is	?
First	of	all	,	how	good	is	it	?	Well	,	it	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	.	It	is	n't	perfect	,	but	it	's	much	,	much	better	than	you	would	expect	,	 give 	 n 	 	our	 complete 	 ly 	 	chaotic	model	.
So	when	you	saw	him	make	a	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	edit	to	the	page	about	me	,	you	think	,	oh	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 obvious 	 ly 	 	just	going	to	 de 	 generate 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 rub 	 b 	 ish 	 	.
But	when	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	quality	 test 	 s 	 	--	and	there	have	n't	 be 	 en 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	of	these	yet	and	I	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 encourag 	 ing 	 	people	to	do	more	,	 compar 	 ing 	 	Wikipedia	to	 tradition 	 al 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	--	we	win	 hand 	 s 	 	down	.
So	a	German	magazine	 compar 	 ed 	 	German	Wikipedia	,	which	is	 re 	 ally 	 	much	,	much	 small 	 er 	 	than	English	,	to	 Micro 	 soft 	 	 En 	 cart 	 a 	 	and	to	 Broc 	 kh 	 au 	 s 	 	 Multi 	 media 	 	,	and	we	won	 a 	 cross 	 	the	board	.
 The 	 y 	 	 hire 	 d 	 	 expert 	 s 	 	to	come	and	look	at	 article 	 s 	 	and	 compar 	 e 	 	the	quality	,	and	we	 we 	 re 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 pleas 	 ed 	 	with	that	result	.
So	a	lot	of	people	have	heard	about	the	Wikipedia	 Bush 	 - 	 Ker 	 ry 	 	 contr 	 over 	 s 	 y 	 	.
The	media	 ha 	 s 	 	 cover 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 some 	 what 	 	 extens 	 ively 	 	.
It	 start 	 ed 	 	out	with	an	article	in	Red	 Her 	 ring 	 	.
The	 report 	 ers 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	me	up	and	they	--	I	mean	,	I	have	to	say	they	 spell 	 ed 	 	my	name	right	,	but	they	 re 	 ally 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	say	,	the	 Bush 	 - 	 Ker 	 ry 	 	election	is	so	 content 	 ious 	 	,	it	's	 tear 	 ing 	 	 a 	 part 	 	the	Wikipedia	community	.	And	so	they	quote	me	 a 	 s 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	 The 	 y 	 	're	the	most	 content 	 ious 	 	in	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	Wikipedia	.	''
What	I	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	is	,	they	're	not	 content 	 ious 	 	at	all	.
So	it	's	a	 s 	 light 	 	 mis 	 quote 	 	.	The	 article 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 edit 	 ed 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 heav 	 ily 	 	.
And	it	is	true	that	we	did	have	to	lock	the	 article 	 s 	 	on	a	couple	of	 occasion 	 s 	 	.
Time	magazine	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 report 	 ed 	 	that	``	Extreme	action	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	taken	,	and	 Wal 	 es 	 	 lock 	 ed 	 	the	 ent 	 ries 	 	on	 Ker 	 ry 	 	and	Bush	for	most	of	2004	.	''
 Th 	 is 	 	came	after	I	told	the	 report 	 er 	 	that	we	had	to	lock	it	for	--	 occasion 	 ally 	 	a	little	bit	here	and	there	.
So	the	truth	in	general	is	that	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 contr 	 over 	 s 	 ies 	 	that	you	would	 prob 	 ably 	 	think	we	have	 with 	 in 	 	the	Wikipedia	community	are	not	 re 	 ally 	 	 contr 	 over 	 s 	 ies 	 	at	all	.
 Article 	 s 	 	on	controversial	 top 	 ic 	 s 	 	are	 edit 	 ed 	 	a	lot	,	but	they	do	n't	cause	much	 contr 	 over 	 s 	 y 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	community	.
And	the	reason	for	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	most	people	understand	the	need	for	 neutral 	 ity 	 	.
The	real	struggle	is	not	between	the	right	and	the	left	--	that	's	where	most	people	 assum 	 e 	 	--	but	it	's	between	the	party	of	the	 thought 	 ful 	 	and	the	party	of	the	 jerk 	 s 	 	.
And	no	side	of	the	 politic 	 al 	 	spectrum	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 monopol 	 y 	 	on	either	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 qual 	 ities 	 	.
The	actual	truth	about	the	specific	 Bush 	 - 	 Ker 	 ry 	 	incident	is	that	the	 Bush 	 - 	 Ker 	 ry 	 	 article 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 lock 	 ed 	 	less	than	one	percent	of	the	time	in	2004	,	and	it	was	n't	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 content 	 ious 	 	;	it	was	just	 be 	 cause 	 	there	was	routine	 van 	 d 	 al 	 ism 	 	--	which	 happen 	 s 	 	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	even	on	stage	,	people	--	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	even	 report 	 ers 	 	have	 report 	 ed 	 	to	me	that	they	vandalize	Wikipedia	and	 we 	 re 	 	 amaz 	 ed 	 	that	it	was	 fix 	 ed 	 	so	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
And	I	 s 	 aid 	 	--	you	know	,	I	 al 	 ways 	 	say	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	do	n't	do	that	;	that	's	not	a	good	thing	.
So	how	do	we	do	 th 	 is 	 	?
How	do	we	manage	the	quality	control	?
How	 do 	 es 	 	it	work	?
So	there	's	a	few	 element 	 s 	 	,	 most 	 ly 	 	social	 poli 	 cies 	 	and	some	 element 	 s 	 	of	the	 soft 	 ware 	 	.
So	the	 big 	 gest 	 	and	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	is	our	neutral	 point 	 - 	 of 	 - 	 view 	 	policy	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	I	set	down	from	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	core	principle	of	the	community	that	's	 complete 	 ly 	 	not	 de 	 bat 	 able 	 	.
It	's	a	social	 con 	 cept 	 	of	 co 	 operation 	 	,	so	we	do	n't	talk	a	lot	about	truth	and	 object 	 ivity 	 	.
The	reason	for	 th 	 is 	 	is	if	we	say	we	're	 on 	 ly 	 	going	to	write	the	``	truth	''	about	some	 top 	 ic 	 	,	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	do	us	a	damn	bit	of	good	of	 figur 	 ing 	 	out	what	to	write	,	 be 	 cause 	 	I	do	n't	agree	with	you	about	what	's	the	truth	.
But	we	have	 th 	 is 	 	 jar 	 gon 	 	term	of	 neutral 	 ity 	 	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	own	long	 histo 	 ry 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	community	,	which	 bas 	 ically 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	any	time	there	's	a	controversial	issue	,	Wikipedia	 it 	 self 	 	should	not	take	a	stand	on	the	issue	.
We	should	 mere 	 ly 	 	report	on	what	 re 	 put 	 able 	 	 part 	 ies 	 	have	 s 	 aid 	 	about	it	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	 neutral 	 ity 	 	policy	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	for	us	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 empower 	 s 	 	a	community	that	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 divers 	 e 	 	to	come	together	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	get	some	work	 d 	 one 	 	.
So	we	have	 ver 	 y 	 	 divers 	 e 	 	 contributor 	 s 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 politic 	 al 	 	,	religious	,	cultural	 back 	 ground 	 s 	 	.
By	 hav 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	firm	 neutral 	 ity 	 	policy	,	which	is	 non 	 - 	 negoti 	 able 	 	from	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	,	we	ensure	that	people	can	work	together	and	that	the	 ent 	 ries 	 	do	n't	 be 	 come 	 	 simpl 	 y 	 	a	war	back	and	forth	between	the	left	and	the	right	.
If	you	engage	in	that	type	of	behavior	,	you	'll	be	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	 leav 	 e 	 	the	community	.
So	 real 	 - 	 time 	 	peer	review	.
Every	single	change	on	the	 s 	 ite 	 	 go 	 es 	 	to	the	 re 	 cent 	 	 change 	 s 	 	page	.
So	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	he	made	his	change	,	it	went	to	the	 re 	 cent 	 	 change 	 s 	 	page	.
That	 re 	 cent 	 	 change 	 s 	 	page	was	 al 	 so 	 	fed	 in 	 to 	 	 IR 	 C 	 	channel	,	which	is	an	Internet	chat	channel	that	people	are	 monitor 	 ing 	 	with	 vari 	 ous 	 	 soft 	 ware 	 	 tool 	 s 	 	.
And	people	can	get	 RS 	 S 	 	 feed 	 s 	 	--	they	can	get	 e 	 - 	 mail 	 	 not 	 ification 	 s 	 	of	 change 	 s 	 	.
And	then	 user 	 s 	 	can	set	up	 the 	 ir 	 	own	personal	watch	list	.
So	my	page	is	on	 quit 	 e 	 	a	few	 volunteer 	 s 	 	'	watch	 list 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 vandalize 	 d 	 	.
And	 there 	 fore 	 	,	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	 some 	 one 	 	will	notice	the	change	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	and	then	they	'll	just	 simpl 	 y 	 	 re 	 vert 	 	the	change	.
There	's	a	new	 page 	 s 	 	feed	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	so	you	can	go	to	a	certain	page	of	Wikipedia	and	see	every	new	page	 a 	 s 	 	it	's	 create 	 d 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	a	lot	of	new	 page 	 s 	 	that	get	 create 	 d 	 	are	just	garbage	that	have	to	be	 delet 	 ed 	 	,	you	know	,	 ASDF 	 ASDF 	 	.
But	 al 	 so 	 	that	's	some	of	the	most	 interest 	 ing 	 	and	 f 	 un 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	at	Wikipedia	,	some	of	the	new	 article 	 s 	 	.
People	will	start	an	article	on	some	 interest 	 ing 	 	 top 	 ic 	 	,	other	people	will	find	that	 intrigu 	 ing 	 	and	jump	in	and	help	and	make	it	much	better	.
So	we	do	have	 edit 	 s 	 	by	 anonym 	 ous 	 	 user 	 s 	 	,	which	is	one	of	the	most	controversial	and	 intrigu 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	about	Wikipedia	.
So	Chris	was	able	to	do	his	change	--	he	did	n't	have	to	log	in	or	 any 	 thing 	 	;	he	just	went	on	the	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	and	made	a	change	.
But	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	 on 	 ly 	 	about	18	percent	of	all	the	 edit 	 s 	 	to	the	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	are	 d 	 one 	 	by	 anonym 	 ous 	 	 user 	 s 	 	.
And	that	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	to	understand	,	is	that	the	vast	 major 	 ity 	 	of	the	 edit 	 s 	 	that	go	on	on	the	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	are	from	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 close 	 - 	 knit 	 	community	of	 may 	 be 	 	600	to	1,000	people	who	are	in	constant	communication	.
And	we	have	over	40	 IR 	 C 	 	 channel 	 s 	 	,	40	 mail 	 ing 	 	 list 	 s 	 	.
All	these	people	know	each	other	.	 The 	 y 	 	communicate	;	we	have	 off 	 line 	 	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	the	people	who	are	 do 	 ing 	 	the	bulk	of	the	 s 	 ite 	 	,	and	they	are	,	in	a	sense	,	 semi 	 - 	 professional 	 s 	 	at	what	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	,	that	the	 standard 	 s 	 	we	set	for	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	are	equal	to	or	 high 	 er 	 	than	professional	 standard 	 s 	 	of	quality	.
We	do	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	meet	 t 	 hose 	 	 standard 	 s 	 	,	but	that	's	what	we	're	 striv 	 ing 	 	for	.
And	so	that	tight	community	is	who	 re 	 ally 	 	 care 	 s 	 	for	the	 s 	 ite 	 	,	and	these	are	some	of	the	 smart 	 est 	 	people	I	've	ever	met	.
Of	course	,	it	's	my	job	to	say	that	,	but	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	true	.
The	type	of	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	drawn	to	writing	an	encyclopedia	for	 f 	 un 	 	tend	to	be	 pre 	 tty 	 	smart	people	.
The	 tool 	 s 	 	and	the	 soft 	 ware 	 	:	there	's	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 tool 	 s 	 	that	allow	us	--	allow	us	,	meaning	the	community	--	to	 self 	 - 	 monitor 	 	and	to	monitor	all	the	work	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	a	page	 histo 	 ry 	 	on	``	flat	earth	,	''	and	you	can	see	some	 change 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	made	.
What	's	nice	about	 th 	 is 	 	page	is	you	can	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	take	a	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	and	see	,	oh	 O 	 K 	 	,	I	understand	now	.
When	 some 	 body 	 	 go 	 es 	 	and	 look 	 s 	 	at	--	they	see	that	 some 	 one 	 	,	an	 anonym 	 ous 	 	IP	number	,	made	an	edit	to	my	page	--	that	 sound 	 s 	 	suspicious	--	who	is	 th 	 is 	 	person	?	 Some 	 body 	 	 look 	 s 	 	at	it	--	they	can	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	see	 high 	 light 	 ed 	 	in	red	all	of	the	 change 	 s 	 	that	took	place	,	to	see	,	 O 	 K 	 	,	well	,	these	 word 	 s 	 	have	 change 	 d 	 	,	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
So	that	's	one	tool	that	we	can	use	to	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	monitor	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	a	page	.
 An 	 other 	 	thing	that	we	do	 with 	 in 	 	the	community	is	we	 leav 	 e 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 open 	 - 	 end 	 ed 	 	.
 Mo 	 st 	 	of	the	social	 rule 	 s 	 	and	the	 method 	 s 	 	of	work	are	left	 complete 	 ly 	 	 open 	 - 	 end 	 ed 	 	in	the	 soft 	 ware 	 	.
All	of	that	stuff	is	just	on	Wiki	 page 	 s 	 	.
And	so	there	's	 noth 	 ing 	 	in	the	 soft 	 ware 	 	that	 enforce 	 s 	 	the	 rule 	 s 	 	.
The	 ex 	 ample 	 	I	've	got	up	here	is	a	 Vote 	 s 	 	For	 De 	 let 	 ion 	 	page	.
So	,	I	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	,	people	type	 ASDF 	 ASDF 	 	--	it	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	 delet 	 ed 	 	.	 Case 	 s 	 	like	that	,	the	 administr 	 ators 	 	just	delete	it	.
There	's	no	reason	to	have	a	big	argument	about	it	.
But	you	can	imagine	there	's	a	lot	of	other	 area 	 s 	 	where	the	question	is	,	is	 th 	 is 	 	 not 	 able 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	to	go	in	an	encyclopedia	?
 I 	 s 	 	the	information	 ver 	 ifiable 	 	?	 I 	 s 	 	it	a	hoax	?	 I 	 s 	 	it	true	?	 I 	 s 	 	it	what	?
So	we	 need 	 ed 	 	a	social	method	for	 figur 	 ing 	 	out	the	answer	to	 th 	 is 	 	.
And	so	the	method	that	 a 	 rose 	 	 organ 	 ically 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	community	is	the	 Vote 	 s 	 	For	 De 	 let 	 ion 	 	page	.
And	in	the	 part 	 icular 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	we	have	here	,	it	's	a	film	,	``	 T 	 wist 	 ed 	 	 Issu 	 es 	 	,	''	and	the	first	person	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 N 	 ow 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	 suppose 	 d 	 ly 	 	a	film	.	It	 fail 	 s 	 	the	Google	test	 mis 	 er 	 ably 	 	.	''
The	Google	test	is	,	you	look	in	Google	and	see	if	it	's	there	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	 some 	 thing 	 	's	not	even	in	Google	,	it	 prob 	 ably 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	exist	at	all	.
It	's	not	a	perfect	rule	,	but	it	's	a	nice	 start 	 ing 	 	point	for	quick	research	.
So	 some 	 body 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 Del 	 ete 	 	it	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	.	 Del 	 ete 	 	it	--	it	's	not	 not 	 able 	 	.	''
And	then	 some 	 body 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	Wait	,	wait	,	wait	,	wait	,	I	found	it	.
I	found	it	in	a	book	,	'Film	Threat	 V 	 ideo 	 	 Gui 	 de 	 	:	the	20	 Under 	 ground 	 	 Film 	 s 	 	You	Must	See	.	'	''	Oh	,	 O 	 K 	 	.	So	the	next	 person 	 s 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 C 	 lean 	 	it	up	.	''
 Some 	 body 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	I	've	found	it	on	 IM 	 D 	 B 	 	.	Keep	,	keep	,	keep	.	''
And	what	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	the	 soft 	 ware 	 	is	--	these	 vote 	 s 	 	are	just	--	they	're	just	text	 type 	 d 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	page	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	not	 re 	 ally 	 	a	vote	so	much	 a 	 s 	 	it	is	a	 dial 	 ogue 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	it	is	true	that	at	the	end	of	the	day	an	 administr 	 ator 	 	can	go	through	here	and	take	a	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	and	say	,	 O 	 K 	 	,	18	 delete 	 s 	 	,	two	 keep 	 s 	 	:	we	'll	delete	it	.
But	in	other	 case 	 s 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	could	be	18	 delete 	 s 	 	and	two	 keep 	 s 	 	,	and	we	would	keep	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	 t 	 hose 	 	last	two	 keep 	 s 	 	say	,	``	Wait	a	minute	,	wait	a	minute	.
 No 	 body 	 	else	saw	 th 	 is 	 	but	I	found	it	in	a	book	,	and	I	found	a	link	to	a	page	that	 de 	 scribe 	 s 	 	it	,	and	I	'm	going	to	clean	it	up	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	,	so	 pleas 	 e 	 	do	n't	delete	it	,	''	then	it	would	 surviv 	 e 	 	.
And	it	 al 	 so 	 	 matter 	 s 	 	who	the	people	are	who	are	 vot 	 ing 	 	.
Like	I	say	,	it	's	a	tight	knit	community	.
Down	here	at	the	bottom	,	``	Keep	,	real	movie	,	''	Rick	Kay	.
Rick	Kay	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	famous	 Wikipedia 	 n 	 	who	 do 	 es 	 	an	enormous	amount	of	work	with	 van 	 d 	 al 	 ism 	 	,	 hoax 	 es 	 	and	 vote 	 s 	 	for	 delet 	 ion 	 	.
 Hi 	 s 	 	voice	 car 	 ries 	 	a	lot	of	weight	 with 	 in 	 	the	community	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 know 	 s 	 	what	he	's	 do 	 ing 	 	.
So	how	's	all	 th 	 is 	 	 govern 	 ed 	 	?
People	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	know	about	,	 O 	 K 	 	,	 administr 	 ators 	 	,	 thing 	 s 	 	like	that	.
So	the	Wikipedia	 govern 	 ance 	 	model	,	the	 govern 	 ance 	 	of	the	community	,	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 con 	 fusing 	 	,	but	a	 work 	 able 	 	mix	of	 con 	 sens 	 us 	 	--	meaning	we	try	not	to	vote	on	the	content	of	 article 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 major 	 ity 	 	view	is	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	neutral	.
Some	amount	of	 demo 	 cracy 	 	,	all	of	the	 administr 	 ators 	 	--	these	are	the	people	who	have	the	ability	to	delete	 page 	 s 	 	,	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	that	they	have	the	right	to	delete	 page 	 s 	 	;	they	still	have	to	follow	all	the	 rule 	 s 	 	--	but	they	're	 elect 	 ed 	 	;	they	're	 elect 	 ed 	 	by	the	community	.	 Some 	 time 	 s 	 	people	--	random	 troll 	 s 	 	on	the	Internet	--	like	to	 accus 	 e 	 	me	of	 hand 	 pick 	 ing 	 	the	 administr 	 ators 	 	to	bias	the	content	of	the	encyclopedia	.
I	 al 	 ways 	 	laugh	at	 th 	 is 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	I	have	no	idea	how	they	're	 elect 	 ed 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	.
There	's	a	certain	amount	of	 aristoc 	 racy 	 	.
And	so	you	've	got	a	hint	of	that	when	I	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	,	like	,	Rick	Kay	's	voice	would	carry	a	lot	more	weight	than	 some 	 one 	 	we	do	n't	know	.
I	give	 th 	 is 	 	talk	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	with	 Angel 	 a 	 	,	who	was	just	 re 	 - 	 elect 	 ed 	 	to	the	 Bo 	 ard 	 	from	the	community	--	to	the	 Bo 	 ard 	 	of	the	 Found 	 ation 	 	,	with	more	than	twice	the	 vote 	 s 	 	of	the	person	who	did	n't	make	it	.
And	I	 al 	 ways 	 	embarrass	her	 be 	 cause 	 	I	say	,	well	,	 Angel 	 a 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	could	get	away	with	 do 	 ing 	 	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	 with 	 in 	 	Wikipedia	,	 be 	 cause 	 	she	's	so	 admire 	 d 	 	and	so	 power 	 ful 	 	.
But	the	 iron 	 y 	 	is	,	of	course	,	that	 Angel 	 a 	 	can	do	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	she	's	the	one	person	who	you	know	would	never	,	ever	,	ever	break	any	 rule 	 s 	 	of	Wikipedia	.
And	I	 al 	 so 	 	like	to	say	she	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	person	who	 actual 	 ly 	 	 know 	 s 	 	all	the	 rule 	 s 	 	of	Wikipedia	,	so	...
And	then	there	's	 mon 	 arch 	 y 	 	and	that	's	my	role	on	the	community	,	so	...
I	was	 de 	 s 	 crib 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	in	 Ber 	 lin 	 	once	and	the	next	day	in	the	 news 	 paper 	 	the	 head 	 line 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	I	am	the	Queen	of	 Eng 	 land 	 	.	''
And	that	's	not	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	but	--	the	point	is	my	role	in	the	community	--	 with 	 in 	 	the	free	 soft 	 ware 	 	world	there	's	 be 	 en 	 	a	 long 	 stand 	 ing 	 	tradition	of	the	``	 benevol 	 ent 	 	dictator	''	model	.
So	if	you	look	at	most	of	the	major	free	 soft 	 ware 	 	 project 	 s 	 	,	they	have	one	single	person	in	charge	who	 every 	 one 	 	 agree 	 s 	 	is	the	 benevol 	 ent 	 	dictator	.
Well	,	I	do	n't	like	the	term	``	 benevol 	 ent 	 	dictator	,	''	and	I	do	n't	think	that	it	's	my	job	or	my	role	in	the	world	of	 idea 	 s 	 	to	be	the	dictator	of	the	future	of	all	human	knowledge	 compil 	 ed 	 	by	the	world	.
It	just	is	n't	appropriate	.
But	there	is	a	need	still	for	a	certain	amount	of	 mon 	 arch 	 y 	 	,	a	certain	amount	of	--	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	we	have	to	make	a	decision	,	and	we	do	n't	want	to	get	 bog 	 ged 	 	down	too	 heav 	 ily 	 	in	 form 	 al 	 	 decision 	 - 	 making 	 	 process 	 es 	 	.
So	 a 	 s 	 	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	why	 th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	--	or	how	 th 	 is 	 	can	be	 import 	 ant 	 	:	we	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	had	a	 situ 	 ation 	 	where	a	 neo 	 - 	 Nazi 	 	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	Wikipedia	,	and	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Oh	,	well	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 horr 	 ible 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 Jew 	 ish 	 	 conspi 	 racy 	 	of	a	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	and	we	're	going	to	get	certain	 article 	 s 	 	 delet 	 ed 	 	that	we	do	n't	like	.
And	we	see	they	have	a	 vot 	 ing 	 	process	,	so	we	're	going	to	 s 	 end 	 	--	we	have	40,000	 member 	 s 	 	and	we	're	going	to	 s 	 end 	 	them	over	and	they	're	all	going	to	vote	and	get	these	 page 	 s 	 	 delet 	 ed 	 	.	''
Well	,	they	 manage 	 d 	 	to	get	18	people	to	show	up	.
That	's	 neo 	 - 	 Nazi 	 	math	for	you	.
 The 	 y 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	think	they	've	got	40,000	 member 	 s 	 	when	they	've	got	18	.
But	they	 manage 	 d 	 	to	get	18	people	to	come	and	vote	in	a	 fair 	 ly 	 	absurd	way	to	delete	a	 perfect 	 ly 	 	valid	article	.
Of	course	,	the	vote	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 be 	 ing 	 	about	85	to	18	,	so	there	was	no	real	danger	to	our	 democrat 	 ic 	 	 process 	 es 	 	.
On	the	other	hand	,	people	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	But	what	are	we	going	to	do	?
I	mean	,	 th 	 is 	 	could	happen	and	what	if	some	group	 get 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 serious 	 ly 	 	 organize 	 d 	 	and	 come 	 s 	 	in	and	 want 	 s 	 	to	vote	?	''
 Th 	 en 	 	I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Well	fuck	it	,	we	'll	just	change	the	 rule 	 s 	 	.	''
That	's	my	job	in	the	community	:	to	say	we	wo	n't	allow	our	 open 	 ness 	 	and	 free 	 dom 	 	to	 under 	 mine 	 	the	quality	of	the	content	.
And	so	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	people	trust	me	in	my	role	,	then	that	's	a	valid	place	for	me	.
Of	course	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	free	 licens 	 ing 	 	,	if	I	do	a	bad	job	,	the	 volunteer 	 s 	 	are	more	than	happy	to	take	and	 leav 	 e 	 	--	I	ca	n't	tell	 any 	 one 	 	what	to	do	.
So	the	final	point	here	is	that	to	understand	how	Wikipedia	 work 	 s 	 	,	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	understand	that	our	Wiki	model	is	the	way	we	work	,	but	we	are	not	 fanatic 	 al 	 	web	 anarch 	 ists 	 	.	In	fact	,	we	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 flex 	 ible 	 	about	the	social	 method 	 ology 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 ultimate 	 ly 	 	the	 pass 	 ion 	 	of	the	community	is	for	the	quality	of	the	work	,	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	for	the	process	that	we	use	to	generate	it	.
Thank	you	.
Ben	Saunders	:	Yeah	,	hi	,	Ben	Saunders	.
 Jim 	 my 	 	,	you	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	 im 	 partial 	 ity 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	a	key	to	Wikipedia	's	success	.
It	 strike 	 s 	 	me	that	much	of	the	 text 	 book 	 s 	 	that	are	used	to	 educ 	 ate 	 	our	children	are	 inherent 	 ly 	 	 bias 	 ed 	 	.
 Hav 	 e 	 	you	found	Wikipedia	 be 	 ing 	 	used	by	 teacher 	 s 	 	,	and	how	do	you	see	Wikipedia	changing	education	?
 Jim 	 my 	 	 Wal 	 es 	 	:	Yeah	,	so	,	a	lot	of	 teacher 	 s 	 	are	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	use	Wikipedia	.
There	's	a	media	 story 	 line 	 	about	Wikipedia	,	which	I	think	is	false	.
It	 build 	 s 	 	on	the	 story 	 line 	 	of	 blogger 	 s 	 	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	 news 	 paper 	 s 	 	.
And	the	 story 	 line 	 	is	,	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	crazy	thing	,	Wikipedia	,	but	 academic 	 s 	 	hate	it	and	 teacher 	 s 	 	hate	it	.	And	that	 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	not	be	true	.
The	last	time	I	got	an	 e 	 - 	 mail 	 	from	a	journalist	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	Why	do	 academic 	 s 	 	hate	Wikipedia	?	''
I	 s 	 ent 	 	it	from	my	Harvard	email	address	,	 be 	 cause 	 	I	was	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 ap 	 point 	 ed 	 	a	fellow	there	.
And	I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Well	,	they	do	n't	all	hate	it	.	''
But	I	think	there	's	going	to	be	huge	 impact 	 s 	 	.
And	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	a	project	that	I	'm	 personal 	 ly 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	,	which	is	the	Wiki	 book 	 s 	 	project	,	which	is	an	effort	to	create	 text 	 book 	 s 	 	in	all	the	 language 	 s 	 	.
And	that	's	a	much	 big 	 ger 	 	project	;	it	's	going	to	take	20	 year 	 s 	 	or	so	to	come	to	 fruit 	 ion 	 	.
But	part	of	that	is	to	fulfill	our	mission	of	giving	an	encyclopedia	to	every	single	person	on	the	planet	.
We	do	n't	mean	we	're	going	to	spam	them	with	 AOL 	 - 	 style 	 	 CD 	 s 	 	.
We	mean	we	're	going	to	give	them	a	tool	that	they	can	use	.
And	for	a	lot	of	people	in	the	world	,	if	I	give	you	an	encyclopedia	that	's	written	at	a	university	level	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	do	you	any	good	 with 	 out 	 	a	whole	host	of	 liter 	 acy 	 	 material 	 s 	 	to	build	you	up	to	the	point	where	you	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	use	it	.
And	so	the	Wiki	 book 	 s 	 	project	is	an	effort	to	do	that	.
And	I	think	that	we	're	going	to	 re 	 ally 	 	see	a	huge	--	it	may	not	even	come	from	us	;	there	's	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 innov 	 ation 	 	going	on	.
But	 free 	 ly 	 	 licens 	 ed 	 	 text 	 book 	 s 	 	are	the	next	big	thing	in	education	.

 Br 	 ews 	 ter 	 	Kahle	 build 	 s 	 	a	free	digital	library
We	 re 	 ally 	 	need	to	put	the	best	we	have	to	 off 	 er 	 	 with 	 in 	 	reach	of	our	children	.
If	we	do	n't	do	that	,	we	're	going	to	get	the	generation	we	deserve	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	going	to	learn	from	 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	they	have	around	them	.
And	we	,	 a 	 s 	 	now	the	elite	,	 parent 	 s 	 	,	 librarian 	 s 	 	,	 professional 	 s 	 	,	 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	,	a	bunch	of	our	 activ 	 ities 	 	are	,	in	fact	,	in	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	the	best	we	have	to	 off 	 er 	 	 with 	 in 	 	reach	of	 t 	 hose 	 	around	us	,	or	 a 	 s 	 	 broad 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	can	.
I	'm	going	to	start	and	end	 th 	 is 	 	talk	with	a	couple	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 carv 	 ed 	 	in	stone	.
One	is	what	's	on	the	 Bo 	 s 	 ton 	 	 Pub 	 lic 	 	 Libra 	 ry 	 	.
 Car 	 v 	 ed 	 	above	 the 	 ir 	 	door	is	,	``	Free	to	All	.	''
It	's	kind	of	an	inspiring	 state 	 ment 	 	,	and	I	'll	go	back	at	the	end	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
I	'm	a	librarian	,	and	what	I	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	is	 br 	 ing 	 	all	of	the	 work 	 s 	 	of	knowledge	to	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	people	 a 	 s 	 	want	to	read	it	.
And	the	idea	of	using	technology	is	perfect	for	us	.
I	think	we	have	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	 one 	 - 	 up 	 	the	 Greek 	 s 	 	.
It	's	not	easy	to	 one 	 - 	 up 	 	the	 Greek 	 s 	 	.	But	with	the	 industrious 	 ness 	 	of	the	 Egyptian 	 s 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	build	the	 Libra 	 ry 	 	of	 Alexa 	 nd 	 ria 	 	--	the	idea	of	a	copy	of	every	book	of	all	the	 people 	 s 	 	of	the	world	.
The	problem	was	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	had	to	go	to	 Alexa 	 nd 	 ria 	 	to	go	to	it	.
On	the	other	hand	,	if	you	did	,	then	great	 thing 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
I	think	we	can	 one 	 - 	 up 	 	the	 Greek 	 s 	 	and	 achiev 	 e 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	.
And	I	'm	going	to	try	to	 argu 	 e 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	one	point	 to 	 day 	 	:	that	universal	access	to	all	knowledge	is	 with 	 in 	 	our	grasp	.
So	if	I	'm	 success 	 ful 	 	,	then	you	'll	 actual 	 ly 	 	come	away	 think 	 ing 	 	,	 yea 	 h 	 	,	we	could	 actual 	 ly 	 	 achiev 	 e 	 	the	great	vision	of	 every 	 thing 	 	ever	 publish 	 ed 	 	,	 every 	 thing 	 	that	was	ever	 me 	 ant 	 	for	 distribut 	 ion 	 	,	 avail 	 able 	 	to	 any 	 body 	 	in	the	world	that	's	ever	 want 	 ed 	 	to	have	access	to	it	.
Yes	,	there	's	 issue 	 s 	 	about	how	money	should	be	 distribut 	 ed 	 	,	and	that	's	still	 be 	 ing 	 	 re 	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	.
But	I	'd	say	there	's	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	money	,	and	there	's	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	demand	,	so	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	 achiev 	 e 	 	that	.
But	I	'm	going	to	go	over	the	 techno 	 logical 	 	,	social	and	sort	of	where	are	we	 a 	 s 	 	a	whole	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	to	that	 part 	 icular 	 	vision	.
And	the	way	I	'm	going	to	try	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	is	do	it	like	the	 Amazon 	 .com 	 	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	,	the	 book 	 s 	 	,	music	,	video	and	just	go	step	--	media	type	by	media	type	,	just	go	and	say	,	all	right	,	how	're	we	 do 	 ing 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	?
So	if	we	start	with	 book 	 s 	 	,	you	know	,	sort	of	where	are	we	?
Well	,	first	you	have	to	,	 a 	 s 	 	an	engineer	,	scope	the	problem	.	How	big	is	it	?
If	you	 want 	 ed 	 	to	put	all	of	the	 publish 	 ed 	 	 work 	 s 	 	 on 	 line 	 	so	that	 any 	 body 	 	could	have	it	 avail 	 able 	 	,	well	,	how	big	a	problem	is	it	?
Well	,	we	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	know	,	but	the	largest	print	library	in	the	world	is	the	 Libra 	 ry 	 	of	Congress	.	It	's	26	million	 volume 	 s 	 	,	26	million	 volume 	 s 	 	.
It	is	,	by	far	and	away	,	the	largest	print	library	in	the	world	.
And	a	book	,	if	you	had	a	book	,	is	about	a	 mega 	 byte 	 	,	so	--	you	know	,	if	you	had	it	in	 Micro 	 soft 	 	Word	.
So	a	 mega 	 byte 	 	,	26	million	 mega 	 byte 	 s 	 	is	26	 tera 	 byte 	 s 	 	--	it	 go 	 es 	 	 mega 	 - 	 	,	 giga 	 - 	 	,	 tera 	 - 	 	.	26	 tera 	 byte 	 s 	 	.
26	 tera 	 byte 	 s 	 	 fit 	 s 	 	in	a	computer	system	that	's	about	 th 	 is 	 	big	,	on	 s 	 pinning 	 	Linux	 drive 	 s 	 	,	and	it	 cost 	 s 	 	about	60,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
So	for	the	cost	of	a	house	--	or	around	here	,	a	 gar 	 age 	 	--	you	can	put	,	you	can	have	 s 	 pinning 	 	all	of	the	 word 	 s 	 	in	the	 Libra 	 ry 	 	of	Congress	.
That	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	neat	.
 Th 	 en 	 	the	question	is	,	what	do	you	get	?
You	know	,	is	it	worth	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	there	?
Do	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	want	it	 on 	 line 	 	?
Some	of	the	first	 thing 	 s 	 	that	people	do	is	they	make	book	 read 	 ers 	 	that	allow	you	to	search	 in 	 side 	 	the	 book 	 s 	 	,	and	that	's	kind	of	 f 	 un 	 	.
And	you	can	download	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	look	around	them	in	new	and	different	ways	.
And	you	can	get	at	them	 remote 	 ly 	 	,	if	you	happen	to	have	a	 lap 	 top 	 	.
There	's	 start 	 ing 	 	to	be	some	of	these	sort	of	page	 turn 	 - 	 y 	 	 inter 	 face 	 s 	 	that	look	a	whole	lot	like	 book 	 s 	 	in	certain	ways	,	and	you	can	search	them	,	make	little	 tab 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	kind	of	cute	--	still	 ver 	 y 	 	 book 	 - 	 like 	 	--	on	your	 lap 	 top 	 	.
But	I	do	n't	know	,	 read 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	on	a	 lap 	 top 	 	--	 when 	 ever 	 	I	pull	up	my	 lap 	 top 	 	,	it	 al 	 ways 	 	 feel 	 s 	 	like	work	.
I	think	that	's	one	of	the	 reason 	 s 	 	why	the	 Kind 	 le 	 	is	so	great	.
I	do	n't	have	to	feel	like	I	'm	at	work	to	read	a	 Kind 	 le 	 	.
It	's	 start 	 ing 	 	to	be	a	little	bit	more	 spec 	 ified 	 	.
But	I	have	to	say	that	there	's	 old 	 er 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	that	I	tend	to	like	.
I	like	the	physical	book	.
And	I	think	we	can	go	and	use	our	technology	to	go	and	 digit 	 ize 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	put	them	on	the	Net	,	and	then	download	,	print	them	and	bind	them	,	and	end	up	with	 book 	 s 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.
And	we	sort	of	 s 	 aid 	 	,	well	,	how	hard	is	 th 	 is 	 	?
And	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	not	be	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	.
We	 actual 	 ly 	 	went	off	to	make	a	 book 	 mobile 	 	.
And	a	 book 	 mobile 	 	--	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	a	van	with	a	satellite	dish	,	a	 print 	 er 	 	,	 bind 	 er 	 	and	cutter	,	and	 kid 	 s 	 	make	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 book 	 s 	 	.
It	 cost 	 s 	 	about	three	 dollar 	 s 	 	to	download	,	print	and	bind	a	normal	,	old	book	.
And	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	come	out	kind	of	nice	looking	.
You	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	get	 re 	 ally 	 	 good 	 - 	 looking 	 	 book 	 s 	 	for	on	the	order	of	one	 pen 	 ny 	 	per	page	,	sort	of	the	 part 	 s 	 	cost	for	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
So	the	idea	of	--	 th 	 is 	 	technology	 actual 	 ly 	 	may	end	up	 put 	 ting 	 	 book 	 s 	 	back	in	people	's	 hand 	 s 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.
There	are	some	other	 book 	 mobile 	 s 	 	running	around	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 Er 	 ic 	 	 El 	 d 	 red 	 	making	 book 	 s 	 	at	 Wal 	 den 	 	 Po 	 nd 	 	--	 Th 	 or 	 eau 	 	's	 work 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	just	before	he	got	 kick 	 ed 	 	out	by	the	 Park 	 s 	 	 Service 	 s 	 	,	for	 com 	 pet 	 ing 	 	with	the	 book 	 store 	 	there	.
In	India	,	they	've	got	 an 	 other 	 	couple	 book 	 mobile 	 s 	 	running	around	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 open 	 ing 	 	day	at	the	 Libra 	 ry 	 	of	 Alexa 	 nd 	 ria 	 	,	the	new	 Libra 	 ry 	 	of	 Alexa 	 nd 	 ria 	 	,	in	Egypt	.
It	was	 quit 	 e 	 	 popular 	 ly 	 	 attend 	 ed 	 	.
And	 kid 	 s 	 	 start 	 ing 	 	to	make	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 book 	 s 	 	,	and	a	happy	kid	with	the	first	book	that	he	's	ever	owned	.
So	the	idea	of	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	use	 th 	 is 	 	technology	to	end	up	with	paper	where	I	can	handle	sort	of	 sound 	 s 	 	a	little	retro	,	but	I	think	it	still	 ha 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	place	.
And	 be 	 ing 	 	from	the	Silicon	 Valle 	 y 	 	,	sort	of	 utopia 	 n 	 	sort	of	world	,	we	thought	,	if	we	can	make	 th 	 is 	 	technology	work	in	 r 	 ural 	 	Uganda	,	we	might	have	 some 	 thing 	 	.
So	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	got	some	 fund 	 ing 	 	from	the	World	Bank	to	try	it	out	.
And	we	found	in	about	30	 day 	 s 	 	we	could	go	and	take	a	couple	 folk 	 s 	 	from	Silicon	 Valle 	 y 	 	,	fly	them	to	Uganda	,	buy	a	car	,	set	up	the	first	Internet	 connect 	 ion 	 	at	the	National	 Libra 	 ry 	 	of	Uganda	,	figure	out	what	they	 want 	 ed 	 	,	and	get	a	program	going	making	 book 	 s 	 	in	 r 	 ural 	 	Uganda	.
And	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	--	so	 techno 	 logically 	 	,	it	 work 	 s 	 	.
What	we	found	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	we	did	n't	have	the	right	 book 	 s 	 	.
So	the	 book 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	in	the	library	.	We	could	get	it	to	people	,	if	they	're	 digit 	 ized 	 	,	but	we	did	n't	know	how	to	 quit 	 e 	 	get	them	 digit 	 ized 	 	.
 Every 	 body 	 	thought	the	answer	is	,	 s 	 end 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	to	India	and	China	.
And	so	we	've	 tri 	 ed 	 	that	,	and	I	'll	go	over	that	in	a	moment	.
There	are	some	 new 	 er 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	for	 deliver 	 ing 	 	that	have	 happen 	 ed 	 	that	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
One	is	a	 print 	 - 	 on 	 - 	 demand 	 	machine	that	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	 Ru 	 be 	 	 Gold 	 berg 	 	machine	.
We	have	one	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	now	.	It	's	 complete 	 ly 	 	cool	.
It	's	all	 convey 	 or 	 	belt	,	and	it	 make 	 s 	 	a	book	.
And	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	``	Espresso	Book	Machine	,	''	and	in	about	10	 minute 	 s 	 	,	you	can	press	a	button	and	make	a	book	.
 Some 	 thing 	 	else	I	'm	 quit 	 e 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	in	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	domain	,	beyond	these	sort	of	 kiosk 	 - 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	where	you	can	get	 book 	 s 	 	on	demand	,	is	some	of	these	new	little	 screen 	 s 	 	that	are	coming	out	.
And	one	of	my	 favor 	 ites 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	$	100	 lap 	 top 	 	.
And	I	do	n't	mean	to	steal	any	thunder	here	,	but	we	've	gone	and	used	one	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	to	be	an	 e 	 - 	 book 	 	 read 	 er 	 	.
So	here	's	one	of	the	beta	 unit 	 s 	 	and	you	can	--	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	be	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 good 	 - 	 looking 	 	 e 	 - 	 book 	 	 read 	 er 	 	.
And	we	have	a	quick	hack	that	we	did	to	try	to	put	one	of	our	 book 	 s 	 	on	it	,	and	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	that	200	 dot 	 s 	 	per	inch	 mean 	 s 	 	that	you	can	put	 s 	 can 	 ned 	 	 book 	 s 	 	on	them	that	look	 re 	 ally 	 	good	.
At	200	 dot 	 s 	 	per	inch	,	it	's	kind	of	the	 equi 	 valent 	 	of	a	300	dot	print	laser	 print 	 er 	 	.
We	're	in	good	 en 	 ough 	 	shape	.
You	 actual 	 ly 	 	can	go	and	read	 s 	 can 	 ned 	 	 book 	 s 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 eas 	 ily 	 	.
So	the	idea	of	 electron 	 ic 	 	 book 	 s 	 	is	 start 	 ing 	 	to	come	about	.
But	how	do	you	go	about	 do 	 ing 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 canning 	 	?
So	we	thought	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	well	,	let	's	try	out	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 end 	 	 book 	 s 	 	to	India	thing	.
And	there	was	a	project	with	,	funded	by	the	National	Science	 Found 	 ation 	 	--	 s 	 ent 	 	a	bunch	of	 scanner 	 s 	 	,	and	the	American	 lib 	 r 	 aries 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	 s 	 end 	 	 book 	 s 	 	.
Well	,	they	did	n't	.	 The 	 y 	 	did	n't	want	to	 s 	 end 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 book 	 s 	 	.
So	we	 b 	 ought 	 	100,000	 book 	 s 	 	and	 s 	 ent 	 	them	to	India	.
And	then	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	why	you	do	n't	want	to	 s 	 end 	 	 book 	 s 	 	to	India	.
The	 less 	 on 	 	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	 s 	 can 	 	your	own	 book 	 s 	 	.
If	you	 re 	 ally 	 	care	about	 book 	 s 	 	,	you	're	going	to	 s 	 can 	 	them	better	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	if	they	're	 valu 	 able 	 	 book 	 s 	 	.
If	they	're	new	 book 	 s 	 	and	you	can	just	,	you	know	,	butcher	them	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	could	just	buy	 an 	 other 	 	one	,	that	's	not	 s 	 uch 	 	a	big	deal	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 do 	 ing 	 	 high 	 - 	 quality 	 	 s 	 canning 	 	.
But	do	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	love	.
But	the	 Indian 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 canning 	 	a	lot	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 book 	 s 	 	--	about	300,000	now	--	 do 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	well	.
The	 Chi 	 nese 	 	did	over	a	million	,	and	the	 Egyptian 	 s 	 	are	about	30,000	.
But	we	 s 	 ent 	 	--	thought	,	 O 	 K 	 	,	if	we	're	going	to	need	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	let	's	do	it	 in 	 - 	 library 	 	.
How	do	we	go	and	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	how	do	we	get	it	down	so	that	it	's	a	cost	point	that	we	could	afford	?
And	we	sort	of	 pick 	 ed 	 	the	price	point	of	10	 cent 	 s 	 	a	page	.
If	it	's	 bas 	 ically 	 	the	cost	of	 xerox 	 ing 	 	to	 bas 	 ically 	 	 digit 	 ize 	 	,	OCR	,	package	it	up	,	make	it	so	that	you	could	download	,	print	and	bind	it	--	the	whole	 she 	 bang 	 	--	we	would	have	 achiev 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	.
So	we	 start 	 ed 	 	out	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	.	How	do	we	get	to	10	 cent 	 s 	 	?
And	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	these	robot	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 work 	 ed 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	well	--	sort	of	these	 auto 	 - 	 page 	 - 	 turn 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
If	we	can	have	 Mar 	 s 	 	 R 	 over 	 s 	 	,	you	'd	think	you	could	turn	 page 	 s 	 	.
But	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	be	 pre 	 tty 	 	hard	to	turn	 page 	 s 	 	,	and	the	volume	is	n't	there	.
So	 any 	 way 	 	--	so	we	 end 	 ed 	 	up	making	our	own	book	scanner	,	and	with	two	digital	,	 high 	 - 	 grade 	 	,	professional	digital	 camera 	 s 	 	,	controlled	museum	 light 	 ing 	 	,	so	even	if	it	's	a	black	and	white	book	,	you	can	go	and	get	the	proper	 in 	 ton 	 ation 	 	.
So	you	 bas 	 ically 	 	do	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	 respect 	 ful 	 	job	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	fax	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	--	the	idea	is	to	do	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	job	 a 	 s 	 	you	're	going	through	these	 lib 	 r 	 aries 	 	.
And	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	10	 cent 	 s 	 	a	page	if	we	run	 thing 	 s 	 	in	volume	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	at	the	 Univers 	 ity 	 	of	 Tor 	 onto 	 	.
And	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	it	 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	,	you	know	,	pay	a	living	wage	.
People	seem	to	love	it	.
Yes	,	it	's	a	little	 bor 	 ing 	 	,	but	some	people	kind	of	get	 in 	 to 	 	the	Zen	of	it	.
And	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	if	it	's	kind	of	 interest 	 ing 	 	 book 	 s 	 	that	you	care	about	,	in	 language 	 s 	 	that	you	can	read	.
We	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	do	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	job	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	at	 get 	 ting 	 	10	 cent 	 s 	 	a	page	.
So	10	 cent 	 s 	 	a	page	,	300	 page 	 s 	 	in	your	average	book	,	30	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	book	.
The	 Libra 	 ry 	 	of	Congress	,	if	you	did	the	whole	darn	thing	--	26	million	 book 	 s 	 	--	is	about	750	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	right	?
But	a	million	 book 	 s 	 	,	I	think	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	would	be	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	start	,	and	that	would	cost	30	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	.	That	's	not	that	big	a	bill	.
And	what	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	do	is	get	 in 	 to 	 	 lib 	 r 	 aries 	 	.
We	've	now	got	eight	of	these	 s 	 canning 	 	 center 	 s 	 	in	three	 count 	 ries 	 	,	and	 lib 	 r 	 aries 	 	are	up	for	 hav 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 book 	 s 	 	 s 	 can 	 ned 	 	.
The	 Get 	 ty 	 	here	is	moving	 the 	 ir 	 	 book 	 s 	 	to	the	 UC 	 LA 	 	,	which	is	where	we	have	one	these	 s 	 canning 	 	 center 	 s 	 	,	and	 s 	 canning 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 out 	 - 	 of 	 - 	 copy 	 right 	 	 book 	 s 	 	,	which	is	fabulous	.
So	we	're	 start 	 ing 	 	to	get	the	 institution 	 al 	 	 respons 	 ibility 	 	.
The	thing	we	're	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	is	the	10	 cent 	 s 	 	.
If	we	can	get	the	10	 cent 	 s 	 	,	all	the	rest	of	it	 flow 	 s 	 	.
We	've	 s 	 can 	 ned 	 	about	200,000	 book 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	we	're	 s 	 canning 	 	about	15,000	 book 	 s 	 	a	month	,	and	it	's	 start 	 ing 	 	to	gear	up	 an 	 other 	 	factor	of	two	from	there	.
So	all	in	all	,	that	's	going	 ver 	 y 	 	well	.
And	we	're	 start 	 ing 	 	to	move	out	of	the	just	 out 	 - 	 of 	 - 	 copy 	 right 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 out 	 - 	 of 	 - 	 print 	 	world	.
So	I	think	of	--	we	're	kind	of	going	from	the	 out 	 - 	 of 	 - 	 copy 	 right 	 	,	library	stuff	,	and	 Amazon 	 .com 	 	is	coming	from	the	 in 	 - 	 print 	 	world	.
And	I	think	we	'll	meet	in	the	middle	some	place	,	and	have	the	classic	thing	that	you	have	,	which	is	a	 publish 	 ing 	 	system	and	a	library	system	 work 	 ing 	 	in	parallel	.
And	so	we	're	 start 	 ing 	 	up	a	program	to	do	 out 	 - 	 of 	 - 	 print 	 	 work 	 s 	 	,	but	 loan 	 ing 	 	them	.
 Ex 	 act 	 ly 	 	what	 loan 	 ing 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	,	I	'm	not	 quit 	 e 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	.
But	 any 	 way 	 	,	 loan 	 ing 	 	 out 	 - 	 of 	 - 	 print 	 	 work 	 s 	 	from	the	 Bo 	 s 	 ton 	 	 Pub 	 lic 	 	 Libra 	 ry 	 	,	the	 Wood 	 s 	 	 Hol 	 e 	 	 Ocean 	 o 	 graphic 	 	Institute	and	a	few	other	 lib 	 r 	 aries 	 	that	are	 start 	 ing 	 	to	 particip 	 ate 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	program	,	to	try	out	 th 	 is 	 	model	of	where	 do 	 es 	 	a	library	stop	and	where	 do 	 es 	 	the	 book 	 store 	 	take	over	.
So	all	in	all	,	it	's	possible	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	in	large	scale	.
We	're	 al 	 so 	 	going	back	over	 micro 	 film 	 	and	 get 	 ting 	 	that	 on 	 line 	 	.
So	,	we	can	do	10	 cent 	 s 	 	a	page	,	we	're	going	15,000	 book 	 s 	 	a	month	and	we	've	got	about	250,000	 book 	 s 	 	 on 	 line 	 	,	 count 	 ing 	 	all	the	other	 project 	 s 	 	that	are	 start 	 ing 	 	to	add	in	.
So	what	I	 want 	 ed 	 	to	 argu 	 e 	 	is	,	 book 	 s 	 	are	 with 	 in 	 	our	grasp	.
The	idea	of	taking	on	the	whole	ball	of	wax	is	not	that	big	a	deal	.
Yes	,	it	 cost 	 s 	 	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	,	low	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	,	but	one	time	shot	and	we	've	got	 bas 	 ically 	 	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 print 	 ed 	 	 liter 	 ature 	 	 on 	 line 	 	.
And	then	,	there	's	business	model	 issue 	 s 	 	about	how	to	try	to	 effective 	 ly 	 	market	it	and	get	it	to	people	.
But	it	is	 with 	 in 	 	our	grasp	,	 techno 	 logically 	 	and	 law 	 - 	 wise 	 	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	for	the	out	of	print	and	out	of	 copy 	 right 	 	,	we	suggest	,	to	be	able	to	get	the	whole	darn	thing	 on 	 line 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	let	's	go	for	audio	,	and	I	'm	going	to	go	through	these	.
So	how	much	is	there	?
Well	,	 a 	 s 	 	best	we	can	tell	,	there	are	about	two	to	three	million	 dis 	 k 	 s 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 publish 	 ed 	 	--	so	78s	,	 long 	 - 	 play 	 ing 	 	 record 	 s 	 	and	 CD 	 s 	 	--	or	at	 l 	 east 	 	that	's	the	largest	 archiv 	 es 	 	of	 publish 	 ed 	 	 material 	 s 	 	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	sort	of	point	at	.
It	 cost 	 s 	 	about	10	 dollar 	 s 	 	a	piece	to	go	and	take	a	 dis 	 k 	 	and	put	it	 on 	 line 	 	,	if	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	in	volume	.
But	we	've	found	that	the	 right 	 s 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 thorn 	 y 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	 fair 	 ly 	 	 heav 	 ily 	 	 litig 	 ated 	 	area	,	so	we	've	found	that	there	are	 niche 	 s 	 	in	the	music	world	that	are	n't	 serv 	 ed 	 	 terr 	 ibly 	 	well	by	the	classic	commercial	 publish 	 ing 	 	system	.
And	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 start 	 ing 	 	to	make	these	 avail 	 able 	 	by	going	and	 off 	 er 	 ing 	 	shelf	space	on	the	Net	.
In	the	 Unit 	 ed 	 	 Stat 	 es 	 	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	cost	you	to	give	 some 	 thing 	 	away	.	Right	?
If	you	give	 some 	 thing 	 	to	a	 char 	 ity 	 	or	to	the	public	,	you	get	a	pat	on	the	back	and	a	tax	 don 	 ation 	 	--	 ex 	 cept 	 	on	the	Net	,	where	you	can	go	broke	.
If	you	put	up	a	video	of	your	 gar 	 age 	 	band	,	and	it	 start 	 s 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 heav 	 ily 	 	 access 	 ed 	 	,	you	can	lose	your	 guitar 	 s 	 	or	your	house	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	any	sense	.
So	we	've	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	 un 	 limit 	 ed 	 	 s 	 to 	 rage 	 	,	 un 	 limit 	 ed 	 	 band 	 width 	 	,	 fore 	 ver 	 	,	for	free	,	to	 any 	 body 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	to	share	that	 belong 	 s 	 	in	a	library	.
And	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	a	lot	of	 taker 	 s 	 	.	One	is	the	rock	'n	'	 roller 	 s 	 	.
The	rock	'n	'	 roller 	 s 	 	had	a	tradition	of	sharing	,	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	 no 	 body 	 	made	any	money	.	You	could	--	concert	 record 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	it	's	not	the	commercial	 record 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	but	concert	 record 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	 start 	 ed 	 	by	the	 G 	 rate 	 ful 	 	Dead	.
And	we	get	about	two	or	three	 band 	 s 	 	a	day	 sign 	 ing 	 	up	.
 The 	 y 	 	give	 per 	 mission 	 	,	and	we	get	about	40	or	50	 concert 	 s 	 	a	day	.
We	have	about	40,000	 concert 	 s 	 	,	 every 	 thing 	 	the	 G 	 rate 	 ful 	 	Dead	ever	did	,	up	on	the	Net	,	so	that	people	can	see	it	and	listen	to	 th 	 is 	 	material	.
So	audio	is	possible	to	put	up	,	but	the	 right 	 s 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	 thorn 	 y 	 	.
We	've	got	a	lot	of	 collect 	 ions 	 	now	--	a	couple	hundred	thousand	 item 	 s 	 	--	and	it	's	growing	over	time	.
 Mov 	 ing 	 	 image 	 s 	 	:	if	you	think	of	 the 	 a 	 tric 	 al 	 	 re 	 lease 	 s 	 	,	there	are	not	that	 man 	 y 	 	of	them	.
 A 	 s 	 	best	we	can	tell	,	there	are	about	150,000	to	200,000	 movie 	 s 	 	ever	that	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	for	a	 large 	 - 	 scale 	 	 the 	 a 	 tric 	 al 	 	 distribut 	 ion 	 	.	It	's	just	not	that	 man 	 y 	 	.
But	half	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 we 	 re 	 	Indian	.
But	 any 	 way 	 	,	it	's	 do 	 able 	 	,	but	we	've	 on 	 ly 	 	found	about	a	thousand	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	that	--	to	be	out	of	 copy 	 right 	 	.
So	we	've	 digit 	 ized 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	and	made	 t 	 hose 	 	 avail 	 able 	 	.
But	we	've	found	that	there	's	 lot 	 s 	 	of	other	 type 	 s 	 	of	 movie 	 s 	 	that	have	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	 s 	 een 	 	the	light	of	day	--	 archiv 	 al 	 	 film 	 s 	 	.
We	've	found	,	 al 	 so 	 	,	a	lot	of	 politic 	 al 	 	 film 	 s 	 	,	a	lot	of	amateur	 film 	 s 	 	,	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 bas 	 ically 	 	 need 	 ing 	 	a	home	,	a	permanent	home	.
So	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 start 	 ing 	 	to	make	these	 avail 	 able 	 	and	it	's	grown	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	popular	.
We	're	not	 quit 	 e 	 	a	YouTube	.
We	 tend 	 ed 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 long 	 er 	 - 	 term 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	and	 al 	 so 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	people	can	 re 	 use 	 	and	make	 in 	 to 	 	new	 movie 	 s 	 	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	just	 be 	 en 	 	great	 f 	 un 	 	.
 Tele 	 vision 	 	 come 	 s 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	a	bit	 large 	 r 	 	.
We	 start 	 ed 	 	 record 	 ing 	 	20	 channel 	 s 	 	of	 tele 	 vision 	 	24	 hour 	 s 	 	a	day	.
It	's	sort	of	the	 big 	 gest 	 	TiVo	box	you	've	ever	 s 	 een 	 	.
It	's	about	a	 pet 	 a 	 byte 	 	,	so	far	,	of	 world 	 wide 	 	 tele 	 vision 	 	--	 Russia 	 n 	 	,	 Chi 	 nese 	 	,	 Japan 	 ese 	 	,	 Iraq 	 i 	 	,	Al	Jazeera	,	 BB 	 C 	 	,	CNN	,	 AB 	 C 	 	,	 C 	 B 	 S 	 	,	NBC	--	24	 hour 	 s 	 	a	day	.
We	 on 	 ly 	 	put	one	week	up	,	which	is	 most 	 ly 	 	for	cost	 reason 	 s 	 	,	which	is	the	9/11	,	sort	of	from	9/11/2001	.	For	one	week	,	what	did	the	world	see	?
CNN	was	 say 	 ing 	 	that	 Palestinian 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 danc 	 ing 	 	in	the	 street 	 s 	 	.
 We 	 re 	 	they	?	Let	's	look	at	the	Palestinian	 tele 	 vision 	 	and	find	out	.
How	can	we	have	critical	 think 	 ing 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	quote	and	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	 compar 	 e 	 	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	past	?
And	 tele 	 vision 	 	is	 dread 	 fully 	 	 un 	 record 	 ed 	 	and	 un 	 quo 	 table 	 	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	by	Jon	 Stew 	 art 	 	,	who	 do 	 es 	 	a	fabulous	job	.
So	 any 	 way 	 	,	 tele 	 vision 	 	is	,	I	would	suggest	,	 with 	 in 	 	our	grasp	.
So	15	 dollar 	 s 	 	per	video	hour	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	about	100	 dollar 	 s 	 	to	150	 dollar 	 s 	 	per	 cell 	 ul 	 oid 	 	hour	,	we	're	able	to	go	and	get	 material 	 s 	 	 on 	 line 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 in 	 expensive 	 ly 	 	and	have	them	up	on	the	Net	.
And	we	've	got	,	now	,	a	lot	of	these	 material 	 s 	 	.
So	we	've	got	about	100,000	 piece 	 s 	 	up	there	.
So	 book 	 s 	 	,	music	,	video	,	 soft 	 ware 	 	.	There	's	 on 	 ly 	 	50,000	 title 	 s 	 	of	it	.
 Mo 	 st 	 ly 	 	the	 issue 	 s 	 	there	are	legal	 issue 	 s 	 	and	 break 	 ing 	 	copy	 protect 	 ions 	 	.
But	we	've	 work 	 ed 	 	through	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	,	but	we	've	still	got	real	 problem 	 s 	 	in	 Wash 	 ington 	 	.
Well	,	we	're	best	known	 a 	 s 	 	the	World	Wide	Web	.
We	've	 be 	 en 	 	 archiv 	 ing 	 	the	World	Wide	Web	since	1996	.
We	take	a	 snap 	 shot 	 	of	every	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	and	all	of	the	 page 	 s 	 	on	it	,	every	two	 month 	 s 	 	.
And	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 pioneer 	 ed 	 	by	Alexa	Internet	,	which	 don 	 ates 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 collect 	 ion 	 	to	the	Internet	 Arch 	 ive 	 	.
And	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	growing	 a 	 long 	 	for	the	last	11	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	a	fantastic	resource	.
And	we	've	made	a	 Way 	 back 	 	Machine	that	you	can	then	go	and	see	old	 web 	 s 	 ites 	 	kind	of	the	way	they	 we 	 re 	 	.
If	you	go	and	search	on	 some 	 thing 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	 Google 	 .com 	 	,	the	different	 version 	 s 	 	of	it	that	we	have	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	when	it	was	an	alpha	 re 	 lease 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	 look 	 ed 	 	like	at	 Stan 	 ford 	 	.
So	 any 	 way 	 	,	you	've	got	 bas 	 ically 	 	an	idea	of	where	 thing 	 s 	 	came	from	.
 Mo 	 st 	 ly 	 	,	people	want	to	see	 the 	 ir 	 	old	stuff	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
If	there	's	one	thing	that	we	want	to	learn	from	the	 Libra 	 ry 	 	of	 Alexa 	 nd 	 ria 	 	version	one	,	which	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	best	known	for	 burn 	 ing 	 	,	is	,	do	n't	just	have	one	copy	.
So	we	've	 start 	 ed 	 	to	--	we	've	made	 an 	 other 	 	copy	of	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	and	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	put	it	back	in	the	 Libra 	 ry 	 	of	 Alexa 	 nd 	 ria 	 	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	of	the	Internet	 Arch 	 ive 	 	at	the	 Libra 	 ry 	 	of	 Alexa 	 nd 	 ria 	 	.
And	we	now	have	 al 	 so 	 	 an 	 other 	 	copy	building	up	in	Amsterdam	.
So	,	we	should	put	it	in	the	San	 Andre 	 a 	 s 	 	 F 	 ault 	 	 Lin 	 e 	 	in	San	 Francis 	 co 	 	,	flood	zone	in	Amsterdam	and	in	the	Middle	East	.	Right	,	so	 any 	 way 	 	...
so	we	're	 hedg 	 ing 	 	our	 bet 	 s 	 	here	.
If	we	go	and	put	it	in	a	couple	more	 place 	 s 	 	,	I	think	we	'll	be	in	good	shape	.
There	's	a	 politic 	 al 	 	and	social	question	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
 I 	 s 	 	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	go	digital	,	is	it	going	to	be	public	or	private	?
There	's	some	large	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	that	have	 s 	 een 	 	 th 	 is 	 	vision	,	that	are	 do 	 ing 	 	 large 	 - 	 scale 	 	 digit 	 ization 	 	,	but	they	're	 lock 	 ing 	 	up	the	public	domain	.
The	question	is	,	is	that	the	world	that	we	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	live	in	?
What	's	the	role	of	the	public	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	the	private	 a 	 s 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	go	forward	?
How	do	we	go	and	have	a	world	where	we	both	have	 lib 	 r 	 aries 	 	and	 publish 	 ing 	 	in	the	future	,	just	 a 	 s 	 	we	 bas 	 ically 	 	 benefit 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	growing	up	?

 An 	 il 	 	 Ana 	 nthaswamy 	 	:	What	it	 take 	 s 	 	to	do	 extrem 	 e 	 	 astro 	 physics 	 
I	would	like	to	talk	 to 	 day 	 	about	what	I	think	is	one	of	the	 great 	 est 	 	 adventure 	 s 	 	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	have	 embark 	 ed 	 	 up 	 on 	 	,	which	is	the	quest	to	understand	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	and	our	place	in	it	.
My	own	interest	in	 th 	 is 	 	subject	,	and	my	 pass 	 ion 	 	for	it	,	 beg 	 an 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	 accident 	 ally 	 	.
I	had	 b 	 ought 	 	a	copy	of	 th 	 is 	 	book	,	``	The	 Univers 	 e 	 	and	 Dr 	 . 	 	Einstein	''	--	a	used	 paper 	 back 	 	from	a	 second 	 hand 	 	 book 	 store 	 	in	 Sea 	 ttle 	 	.
A	few	 year 	 s 	 	after	that	,	in	 Bang 	 al 	 ore 	 	,	I	was	 find 	 ing 	 	it	hard	to	fall	 a 	 sleep 	 	one	night	,	and	I	 pick 	 ed 	 	up	 th 	 is 	 	book	,	 think 	 ing 	 	it	would	put	me	to	sleep	in	10	 minute 	 s 	 	.
And	 a 	 s 	 	it	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	I	read	it	from	 mid 	 night 	 	to	five	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	in	one	shot	.
And	I	was	left	with	 th 	 is 	 	 intens 	 e 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	awe	and	 exhila 	 ration 	 	at	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	and	our	own	ability	to	understand	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	we	do	.
And	that	 feel 	 ing 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	left	me	yet	.
That	 feel 	 ing 	 	was	the	trigger	for	me	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	change	my	 care 	 er 	 	--	from	 be 	 ing 	 	a	 soft 	 ware 	 	engineer	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	science	writer	--	so	that	I	could	 par 	 take 	 	in	the	joy	of	science	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	the	joy	of	 commun 	 ic 	 ating 	 	it	to	 other 	 s 	 	.
And	that	 feel 	 ing 	 	 al 	 so 	 	led	me	to	a	 pil 	 grim 	 age 	 	of	 sort 	 s 	 	,	to	go	 liter 	 ally 	 	to	the	 end 	 s 	 	of	the	earth	to	see	 tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	,	 detect 	 ors 	 	,	 instrument 	 s 	 	that	people	are	building	,	or	have	built	,	in	order	to	 prob 	 e 	 	the	 cosmo 	 s 	 	in	 great 	 er 	 	and	 great 	 er 	 	detail	.
So	it	took	me	from	 place 	 s 	 	like	 Chi 	 le 	 	--	the	 A 	 ta 	 cama 	 	Desert	in	 Chi 	 le 	 	--	to	Siberia	,	to	 under 	 ground 	 	 mine 	 s 	 	in	the	 Japan 	 ese 	 	 Al 	 ps 	 	,	in	 North 	 ern 	 	America	,	all	the	way	to	 Antarctic 	 a 	 	and	even	to	the	South	 Pol 	 e 	 	.
And	 to 	 day 	 	I	would	like	to	share	with	you	some	 image 	 s 	 	,	some	 st 	 ories 	 	of	these	 trip 	 s 	 	.
I	have	 be 	 en 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	the	last	few	 year 	 s 	 	 document 	 ing 	 	the	 effort 	 s 	 	of	some	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 in 	 trepid 	 	men	and	women	who	are	 put 	 ting 	 	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	at	 time 	 s 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	at	 s 	 take 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	in	some	 ver 	 y 	 	remote	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 hostil 	 e 	 	 place 	 s 	 	so	that	they	may	gather	the	 faint 	 est 	 	 signal 	 s 	 	from	the	 cosmo 	 s 	 	in	order	for	us	to	understand	 th 	 is 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
And	I	first	begin	with	a	pie	chart	--	and	I	promise	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 on 	 ly 	 	pie	chart	in	the	whole	 present 	 ation 	 	--	but	it	 set 	 s 	 	up	the	state	of	our	knowledge	of	the	 cosmo 	 s 	 	.
All	the	 the 	 ories 	 	in	physics	that	we	have	 to 	 day 	 	 proper 	 ly 	 	explain	what	is	 call 	 ed 	 	normal	matter	--	the	stuff	that	we	're	all	made	of	--	and	that	's	four	percent	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
 Astronomer 	 s 	 	and	 cosmo 	 logists 	 	and	 physicist 	 s 	 	think	that	there	is	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	dark	matter	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	which	 make 	 s 	 	up	23	percent	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	and	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	dark	energy	,	which	 permeate 	 s 	 	the	fabric	of	 space 	 - 	 time 	 	,	that	 make 	 s 	 	up	 an 	 other 	 	73	percent	.
So	if	you	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	pie	chart	,	96	percent	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	in	our	exploration	of	it	,	is	 un 	 known 	 	or	not	well	 under 	 stood 	 	.
And	most	of	the	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	 tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	that	I	went	to	see	are	in	some	way	 address 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	question	,	these	two	 t 	 win 	 	 myster 	 ies 	 	of	dark	matter	and	dark	energy	.
I	will	take	you	first	to	an	 under 	 ground 	 	mine	in	 North 	 ern 	 	Minnesota	where	people	are	looking	for	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	dark	matter	.
And	the	idea	here	is	that	they	are	looking	for	a	sign	of	a	dark	matter	particle	hitting	one	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 detect 	 ors 	 	.
And	the	reason	why	they	have	to	go	 under 	 ground 	 	is	that	,	if	you	did	 th 	 is 	 	experiment	on	the	surface	of	the	Earth	,	the	same	experiment	would	be	 swamp 	 ed 	 	by	 signal 	 s 	 	that	could	be	 create 	 d 	 	by	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 cosm 	 ic 	 	 ray 	 s 	 	,	 ambi 	 ent 	 	radio	activity	,	even	our	own	bodies	.	You	might	not	 believ 	 e 	 	it	,	but	even	our	own	bodies	are	 radio 	 active 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	to	disturb	 th 	 is 	 	experiment	.
So	they	go	deep	 in 	 side 	 	 mine 	 s 	 	to	find	a	kind	of	 environment 	 al 	 	silence	that	will	allow	them	to	hear	the	ping	of	a	dark	matter	particle	hitting	 the 	 ir 	 	 detect 	 or 	 	.
And	I	went	to	see	one	of	these	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	--	you	can	 bare 	 ly 	 	see	it	,	and	the	reason	for	that	is	it	's	 entire 	 ly 	 	dark	in	there	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	cavern	that	was	left	 be 	 hind 	 	by	the	 min 	 ers 	 	who	left	 th 	 is 	 	mine	in	1960	.
And	 physicist 	 s 	 	came	and	 start 	 ed 	 	using	it	 some 	 time 	 	in	the	1980s	.
And	the	 min 	 ers 	 	in	the	early	part	of	the	last	century	 work 	 ed 	 	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	in	 candle 	 light 	 	.
And	 to 	 day 	 	,	you	would	see	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 side 	 	the	mine	,	half	a	mile	 under 	 ground 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	largest	 under 	 ground 	 	 lab 	 s 	 	in	the	world	.
And	,	among	other	 thing 	 s 	 	,	they	're	looking	for	dark	matter	.
There	is	 an 	 other 	 	way	to	search	for	dark	matter	,	which	is	 in 	 direct 	 ly 	 	.
If	dark	matter	 exist 	 s 	 	in	our	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	in	our	 galax 	 y 	 	,	then	these	 particle 	 s 	 	should	be	 s 	 mash 	 ing 	 	together	and	producing	other	 particle 	 s 	 	that	we	know	about	--	one	of	them	 be 	 ing 	 	 neutrino 	 s 	 	.
And	 neutrino 	 s 	 	you	can	detect	by	the	signature	they	 leav 	 e 	 	when	they	hit	water	 molecule 	 s 	 	.
When	a	neutrino	 hit 	 s 	 	a	water	molecule	it	 emit 	 s 	 	a	kind	of	blue	light	,	a	flash	of	blue	light	,	and	by	looking	for	 th 	 is 	 	blue	light	,	you	can	 essential 	 ly 	 	understand	 some 	 thing 	 	about	the	neutrino	and	then	,	 in 	 direct 	 ly 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	about	the	dark	matter	that	might	have	 create 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	neutrino	.
But	you	need	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	large	 volume 	 s 	 	of	water	in	order	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
You	need	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 mega 	 ton 	 s 	 	of	water	--	 al 	 most 	 	a	 giga 	 ton 	 	of	water	--	in	order	to	have	any	chance	of	 catch 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	neutrino	.
And	where	in	the	world	would	you	find	 s 	 uch 	 	water	?
Well	the	 Russia 	 ns 	 	have	a	tank	in	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 back 	 yard 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	Lake	 Bai 	 k 	 al 	 	.
It	is	the	largest	lake	in	the	world	.	It	's	800	km	long	.
It	's	about	40	to	50	km	wide	in	most	 place 	 s 	 	,	and	one	to	two	 kilometer 	 s 	 	deep	.
And	what	the	 Russia 	 ns 	 	are	 do 	 ing 	 	is	they	're	building	these	 detect 	 ors 	 	and	 immers 	 ing 	 	them	about	a	kilometer	 be 	 neath 	 	the	surface	of	the	lake	so	that	they	can	watch	for	these	 flash 	 es 	 	of	blue	light	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	scene	that	 greet 	 ed 	 	me	when	I	 land 	 ed 	 	there	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	Lake	 Bai 	 k 	 al 	 	in	the	peak	of	the	 Siberia 	 n 	 	winter	.
The	lake	is	 entire 	 ly 	 	 froze 	 n 	 	.
And	the	line	of	black	 dot 	 s 	 	that	you	see	in	the	 back 	 ground 	 	,	that	's	the	ice	camp	where	the	 physicist 	 s 	 	are	 work 	 ing 	 	.
The	reason	why	they	have	to	work	in	winter	is	 be 	 cause 	 	they	do	n't	have	the	money	to	work	in	summer	and	spring	,	which	,	if	they	did	that	,	they	would	need	 ship 	 s 	 	and	 submersible 	 s 	 	to	do	 the 	 ir 	 	work	.
So	they	wait	 un 	 til 	 	winter	--	the	lake	is	 complete 	 ly 	 	 froze 	 n 	 	over	--	and	they	use	 th 	 is 	 	 meter 	 - 	 thick 	 	ice	 a 	 s 	 	a	platform	on	which	to	establish	 the 	 ir 	 	ice	camp	and	do	 the 	 ir 	 	work	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 Russia 	 ns 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	the	ice	in	the	peak	of	the	 Siberia 	 n 	 	winter	.
 The 	 y 	 	have	to	drill	 hole 	 s 	 	in	the	ice	,	 d 	 ive 	 	down	 in 	 to 	 	the	water	--	cold	,	cold	water	--	to	get	hold	of	the	instrument	,	 br 	 ing 	 	it	up	,	do	any	 repair 	 s 	 	and	maintenance	that	they	need	to	do	,	put	it	back	and	get	out	before	the	ice	 melt 	 s 	 	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	that	phase	of	solid	ice	 last 	 s 	 	for	two	 month 	 s 	 	and	it	's	full	of	 crack 	 s 	 	.
And	you	have	to	imagine	,	there	's	an	entire	 sea 	 - 	 like 	 	lake	I	still	do	n't	understand	 th 	 is 	 	one	 Russia 	 n 	 	man	 work 	 ing 	 	in	his	bare	chest	,	but	that	 tell 	 s 	 	you	how	hard	he	was	 work 	 ing 	 	.
And	these	people	,	a	 hand 	 ful 	 	of	people	,	have	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	for	20	 year 	 s 	 	,	looking	for	 particle 	 s 	 	that	may	or	may	not	exist	.
And	they	have	 dedicate 	 d 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	to	it	.
And	just	to	give	you	an	idea	,	they	have	 s 	 pent 	 	20	million	over	20	 year 	 s 	 	.
It	's	 ver 	 y 	 	harsh	 condition 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	work	on	a	 shoe 	 string 	 	budget	.
The	 toilet 	 s 	 	there	are	 liter 	 ally 	 	 hole 	 s 	 	in	the	ground	 cover 	 ed 	 	with	a	 wood 	 en 	 	 s 	 hack 	 	.
And	it	's	that	 bas 	 ic 	 	,	but	they	do	 th 	 is 	 	every	year	.
From	Siberia	to	the	 A 	 ta 	 cama 	 	Desert	in	 Chi 	 le 	 	,	to	see	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	The	 Ver 	 y 	 	Large	 Tele 	 scope 	 	.
The	 Ver 	 y 	 	Large	 Tele 	 scope 	 	is	one	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	that	 astronomer 	 s 	 	do	--	they	name	 the 	 ir 	 	 tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	 un 	 imagin 	 ative 	 ly 	 	.
I	can	tell	you	for	a	fact	,	that	the	next	one	that	they	're	 plan 	 ning 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	The	 Extreme 	 ly 	 	Large	 Tele 	 scope 	 	.
And	you	would	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	it	,	but	the	one	after	that	is	going	to	be	 call 	 ed 	 	The	 Over 	 w 	 helm 	 ing 	 ly 	 	Large	 Tele 	 scope 	 	.
But	 non 	 e 	 the 	 less 	 	,	it	's	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	piece	of	 engineer 	 ing 	 	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	four	8.2	meter	 tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	.
And	these	 tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	,	among	other	 thing 	 s 	 	,	they	're	 be 	 ing 	 	used	to	 stud 	 y 	 	how	the	expansion	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	changing	with	time	.
And	the	more	you	understand	that	,	the	better	you	would	understand	what	 th 	 is 	 	dark	energy	that	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	made	of	is	all	about	.
And	one	piece	of	 engineer 	 ing 	 	that	I	want	to	 leav 	 e 	 	you	with	 a 	 s 	 	 regard 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 tele 	 scope 	 	is	the	mirror	.
 E 	 ach 	 	mirror	,	there	are	four	of	them	,	is	made	of	a	single	piece	of	glass	,	a	 monolith 	 ic 	 	piece	of	 high 	 - 	 tech 	 	ceramic	,	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	ground	down	and	 polish 	 ed 	 	to	 s 	 uch 	 	 accu 	 racy 	 	that	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	to	understand	what	that	is	is	[	to	]	imagine	a	city	like	Paris	,	with	all	 it 	 s 	 	 building 	 s 	 	and	the	Eiffel	Tower	,	if	you	grind	down	Paris	to	that	kind	of	 accu 	 racy 	 	,	you	would	be	left	with	 bump 	 s 	 	that	are	one	millimeter	high	.
And	that	's	the	kind	of	 polish 	 ing 	 	that	these	 mirror 	 s 	 	have	 endur 	 ed 	 	.
An	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	set	of	 tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	.
 He 	 re 	 	's	 an 	 other 	 	view	of	the	same	.
The	reason	why	you	have	to	build	these	 tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	in	 place 	 s 	 	like	the	 A 	 ta 	 cama 	 	Desert	is	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	high	altitude	desert	.
The	dry	air	is	 re 	 ally 	 	good	for	 tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	,	the	cloud	cover	is	 be 	 low 	 	the	 summ 	 it 	 	of	these	 mountain 	 s 	 	so	that	the	 tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	have	about	300	 day 	 s 	 	of	clear	 ski 	 es 	 	.
 Fin 	 ally 	 	,	I	want	to	take	you	to	 Antarctic 	 a 	 	.
I	want	to	 s 	 pend 	 	most	of	my	time	on	 th 	 is 	 	part	of	the	world	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 cosmo 	 logy 	 	's	final	 front 	 ier 	 	.
Some	of	the	most	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	some	of	the	most	 extrem 	 e 	 	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 d 	 one 	 	in	 Antarctic 	 a 	 	.
I	was	there	to	view	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	a	 long 	 - 	 dur 	 ation 	 	balloon	flight	,	which	 bas 	 ically 	 	 take 	 s 	 	 tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	and	 instrument 	 s 	 	all	the	way	to	the	upper	atmosphere	,	the	upper	 strato 	 sphere 	 	,	40	km	up	.
And	that	's	where	they	do	 the 	 ir 	 	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	and	then	the	balloon	,	the	 pay 	 load 	 	,	is	 br 	 ought 	 	down	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	is	us	 land 	 ing 	 	on	the	Ross	Ice	 She 	 lf 	 	in	 Antarctic 	 a 	 	.
That	's	an	American	 C 	 - 	 17 	 	 car 	 go 	 	plane	that	flew	us	from	New	Zealand	to	McMurdo	in	 Antarctic 	 a 	 	.
And	here	we	are	about	to	board	our	bus	.
And	I	do	n't	know	if	you	can	read	the	 letter 	 ing 	 	,	but	it	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 I 	 van 	 	the	 Terr 	 ibu 	 s 	 	.	''
And	that	's	taking	us	to	McMurdo	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	scene	that	 greet 	 s 	 	you	in	McMurdo	.
And	you	 bare 	 ly 	 	might	be	able	to	make	out	 th 	 is 	 	hut	here	.
 Th 	 is 	 	hut	was	built	by	 Ro 	 bert 	 	Falcon	Scott	and	his	men	when	they	first	came	to	 Antarctic 	 a 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	first	 exp 	 ed 	 ition 	 	to	go	to	the	South	 Pol 	 e 	 	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	it	's	so	cold	,	the	entire	 content 	 s 	 	of	that	hut	is	still	 a 	 s 	 	they	left	it	,	with	the	 remnant 	 s 	 	of	the	last	meal	they	 cook 	 ed 	 	still	there	.
It	's	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	place	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	McMurdo	 it 	 self 	 	.	 Ab 	 out 	 	a	thousand	people	work	here	in	summer	,	and	about	200	in	winter	when	it	's	 complete 	 ly 	 	dark	for	six	 month 	 s 	 	.
I	was	here	to	see	the	launch	of	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	type	of	instrument	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	 cosm 	 ic 	 	ray	experiment	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 launch 	 ed 	 	all	the	way	to	the	 upper 	 - 	 strato 	 sphere 	 	to	an	altitude	of	40	km	.
What	I	want	you	to	imagine	is	 th 	 is 	 	is	two	 ton 	 s 	 	in	weight	.
So	you	're	using	a	balloon	to	carry	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	two	 ton 	 s 	 	all	the	way	to	an	altitude	of	40	km	.
And	the	 engineer 	 s 	 	,	the	 technician 	 s 	 	,	the	 physicist 	 s 	 	have	all	got	to	assemble	on	the	Ross	Ice	 She 	 lf 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 Antarctic 	 a 	 	--	I	wo	n't	go	 in 	 to 	 	the	 reason 	 s 	 	why	--	but	it	's	one	of	the	most	 favor 	 able 	 	 place 	 s 	 	for	 do 	 ing 	 	these	balloon	 launch 	 es 	 	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	for	the	weather	.
The	weather	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	can	imagine	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	summer	,	and	you	're	 stand 	 ing 	 	on	200	ft	of	ice	.
And	there	's	a	 volcan 	 o 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 glaci 	 ers 	 	at	the	 ver 	 y 	 	top	.
And	what	they	have	to	do	is	they	have	to	assemble	the	entire	balloon	--	the	fabric	,	 parachut 	 e 	 	and	 every 	 thing 	 	--	on	the	ice	and	then	fill	it	up	with	 hel 	 ium 	 	.
And	that	process	 take 	 s 	 	about	two	 hour 	 s 	 	.
And	the	weather	can	change	 a 	 s 	 	they	're	 put 	 ting 	 	together	 th 	 is 	 	whole	 assem 	 bly 	 	.
For	 in 	 stance 	 	,	here	they	are	 lay 	 ing 	 	down	the	balloon	fabric	 be 	 hind 	 	,	which	is	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	going	to	be	 fill 	 ed 	 	up	with	 hel 	 ium 	 	.
 T 	 hose 	 	two	 truck 	 s 	 	you	see	at	the	 ver 	 y 	 	end	carry	12	 tank 	 s 	 	each	of	 compress 	 ed 	 	 hel 	 ium 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	in	case	the	weather	 change 	 s 	 	before	the	launch	,	they	have	to	 actual 	 ly 	 	pack	 every 	 thing 	 	back	up	 in 	 to 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	boxes	and	take	it	out	back	to	McMurdo	 St 	 ation 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	balloon	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	launch	two	 ton 	 s 	 	of	weight	,	is	an	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	huge	balloon	.
The	fabric	 al 	 one 	 	 weigh 	 s 	 	two	 ton 	 s 	 	.
In	order	to	 minim 	 ize 	 	the	weight	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	thin	,	it	's	 a 	 s 	 	thin	 a 	 s 	 	a	sandwich	 wrap 	 per 	 	.
And	if	they	have	to	pack	it	back	,	they	have	to	put	it	 in 	 to 	 	boxes	and	stamp	on	it	so	that	it	 fit 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	box	 aga 	 in 	 	--	 ex 	 cept 	 	,	when	they	did	it	first	,	it	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	 d 	 one 	 	in	Texas	.
 He 	 re 	 	,	they	ca	n't	do	it	with	the	kind	 shoe 	 s 	 	they	're	 wear 	 ing 	 	,	so	they	have	to	take	 the 	 ir 	 	 shoe 	 s 	 	off	,	get	 bare 	 foot 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	boxes	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	cold	,	and	do	that	kind	of	work	.
That	's	the	kind	of	 d 	 ed 	 ic 	 ation 	 	these	people	have	.
 He 	 re 	 	's	the	balloon	 be 	 ing 	 	 fill 	 ed 	 	up	with	 hel 	 ium 	 	,	and	you	can	see	it	's	a	 gorge 	 ous 	 	sight	.
 He 	 re 	 	's	a	scene	that	 show 	 s 	 	you	the	balloon	and	the	 pay 	 load 	 	 end 	 - 	 to 	 - 	 end 	 	.
So	the	balloon	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 fill 	 ed 	 	up	with	 hel 	 ium 	 	on	the	 left 	 - 	 hand 	 	side	,	and	the	fabric	 actual 	 ly 	 	 run 	 s 	 	all	the	way	to	the	middle	where	there	's	a	piece	of	 electron 	 ic 	 s 	 	and	 explosive 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	a	 parachut 	 e 	 	,	and	then	the	 parachut 	 e 	 	is	then	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	the	 pay 	 load 	 	.
And	remember	,	all	 th 	 is 	 	wiring	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 d 	 one 	 	by	people	in	 extrem 	 e 	 	cold	,	in	 sub 	 - 	 zero 	 	 temperature 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	 wear 	 ing 	 	about	15	 k 	 g 	 	of	 cloth 	 ing 	 	and	stuff	,	but	they	have	to	take	 the 	 ir 	 	 glove 	 s 	 	off	in	order	to	do	that	.
And	I	would	like	to	share	with	you	a	launch	.
Radio	:	 Oka 	 y 	 	,	 re 	 lease 	 	the	balloon	,	 re 	 lease 	 	the	balloon	,	 re 	 lease 	 	the	balloon	.
 An 	 il 	 	 Ana 	 nthaswamy 	 	:	And	I	'll	 final 	 ly 	 	like	to	 leav 	 e 	 	you	with	two	 image 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	an	 observ 	 atory 	 	in	the	 Himalaya 	 s 	 	,	in	 Lad 	 a 	 kh 	 	in	India	.
And	the	thing	I	want	you	to	look	at	here	is	the	 tele 	 scope 	 	on	the	 right 	 - 	 hand 	 	side	.
And	on	the	far	left	there	is	a	400	 year 	 - 	 old 	 	Buddhist	 mon 	 aste 	 ry 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	 close 	 - 	 up 	 	of	the	Buddhist	 mon 	 aste 	 ry 	 	.
And	I	was	 s 	 truck 	 	by	the	 juxta 	 position 	 	of	these	two	enormous	 discipline 	 s 	 	that	 human 	 ity 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	.
One	is	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	the	 cosmo 	 s 	 	on	the	 out 	 side 	 	,	and	the	other	one	is	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	our	 in 	 terior 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	.
And	both	 requir 	 e 	 	silence	of	some	sort	.
And	what	 s 	 truck 	 	me	was	every	place	that	I	went	to	to	see	these	 tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	,	the	 astronomer 	 s 	 	and	 cosmo 	 logists 	 	are	in	search	of	a	certain	kind	of	silence	,	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	silence	from	radio	 poll 	 ution 	 	or	light	 poll 	 ution 	 	or	 what 	 ever 	 	.
And	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	obvious	that	,	if	we	destroy	these	silent	 place 	 s 	 	on	Earth	,	we	will	be	 s 	 tuck 	 	on	a	planet	 with 	 out 	 	the	ability	to	look	 out 	 ward 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	will	not	be	able	to	understand	the	 signal 	 s 	 	that	come	from	 out 	 er 	 	space	.

Paul	Stamets	on	6	ways	 mushroom 	 s 	 	can	 s 	 ave 	 	the	world
I	love	a	 challeng 	 e 	 	,	and	saving	the	Earth	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	a	good	one	.
We	all	know	the	Earth	is	in	trouble	.
We	have	now	 enter 	 ed 	 	in	the	6X	,	the	sixth	major	 extinct 	 ion 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	.
I	often	 wonder 	 ed 	 	,	if	there	was	a	 Unit 	 ed 	 	 Organ 	 ization 	 	of	 Organ 	 ism 	 s 	 	--	 other 	 wise 	 	known	 a 	 s 	 	``	 Uh 	 - 	 Oh 	 	''	--	--	and	every	organism	had	a	right	to	vote	,	would	we	be	 vot 	 ed 	 	on	the	planet	,	or	off	the	planet	?
I	think	that	vote	is	 occur 	 ring 	 	right	now	.
I	want	to	present	to	you	a	 suit 	 e 	 	of	six	 myco 	 logical 	 	 solution 	 s 	 	,	using	fungi	,	and	these	 solution 	 s 	 	are	based	on	 mycel 	 ium 	 	.
The	 mycel 	 ium 	 	 in 	 fuse 	 s 	 	all	 land 	 scapes 	 	,	it	 hold 	 s 	 	 s 	 oil 	 s 	 	together	,	it	's	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 ten 	 acious 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 hold 	 s 	 	up	to	30,000	 time 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	mass	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	the	grand	 mole 	 cular 	 	 dis 	 assemble 	 rs 	 	of	nature	--	the	 s 	 oil 	 	 magic 	 ians 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	generate	the	 hum 	 us 	 	 s 	 oil 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	 land 	 masse 	 s 	 	of	Earth	.
We	have	now	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	there	is	a	 multi 	 - 	 direction 	 al 	 	transfer	of	 nutrient 	 s 	 	between	 plant 	 s 	 	,	 mitig 	 ated 	 	by	the	 mcyel 	 ium 	 	--	so	the	 mycel 	 ium 	 	is	the	mother	that	is	giving	 nutrient 	 s 	 	from	 al 	 der 	 	and	 bi 	 rch 	 	 tree 	 s 	 	to	 hem 	 lock 	 s 	 	,	 cedar 	 s 	 	and	Douglas	 fir 	 s 	 	.
 Dust 	 y 	 	and	I	,	we	like	to	say	,	on	 Sun 	 day 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	where	we	go	to	church	.
I	'm	in	love	with	the	 old 	 - 	 growth 	 	forest	,	and	I	'm	a	 patriot 	 ic 	 	American	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	 t 	 hose 	 	.
 Mo 	 st 	 	of	you	are	familiar	with	 Porto 	 bell 	 o 	 	 mushroom 	 s 	 	.
And	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	I	face	a	big	obstacle	.
When	I	 ment 	 ion 	 	 mushroom 	 s 	 	to	 some 	 body 	 	,	they	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	think	 Porto 	 bell 	 os 	 	or	magic	 mushroom 	 s 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	 glaz 	 e 	 	over	,	and	they	think	I	'm	a	little	crazy	.
So	,	I	hope	to	 pierc 	 e 	 	that	prejudice	 fore 	 ver 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	group	.
We	call	it	 myco 	 phobia 	 	,	the	irrational	fear	of	the	 un 	 known 	 	,	when	it	 come 	 s 	 	to	fungi	.
 Mushroom 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	fast	in	 the 	 ir 	 	growth	.
Day	21	,	day	23	,	day	25	.
 Mushroom 	 s 	 	produce	strong	 anti 	 biotic 	 s 	 	.
In	fact	,	we	're	more	 close 	 ly 	 	related	to	fungi	than	we	are	to	any	other	 king 	 dom 	 	.
A	group	of	20	 eukary 	 otic 	 	 micro 	 biologist 	 s 	 	 publish 	 ed 	 	a	paper	two	 year 	 s 	 	ago	 erect 	 ing 	 	opisthokonta	--	a	 super 	 - 	 king 	 dom 	 	that	 join 	 s 	 	 animal 	 ia 	 	and	fungi	together	.
We	share	in	common	the	same	 pathogen 	 s 	 	.
 F 	 un 	 gi 	 	do	n't	like	to	rot	from	bacteria	,	and	so	our	best	 anti 	 biotic 	 s 	 	come	from	fungi	.
But	here	is	a	mushroom	that	's	past	 it 	 s 	 	prime	.
After	they	 sporulat 	 e 	 	,	they	do	rot	.
But	I	 pro 	 pose 	 	to	you	that	the	sequence	of	 micro 	 be 	 s 	 	that	occur	on	 rot 	 ting 	 	 mushroom 	 s 	 	are	essential	for	the	health	of	the	forest	.
 The 	 y 	 	give	rise	to	the	 tree 	 s 	 	,	they	create	the	 deb 	 ris 	 	 field 	 s 	 	that	feed	the	 mycel 	 ium 	 	.
And	so	we	see	a	mushroom	here	 sporulat 	 ing 	 	.
And	the	 s 	 pore 	 s 	 	are	 germ 	 in 	 ating 	 	,	and	the	 mycel 	 ium 	 	 form 	 s 	 	and	 go 	 es 	 	 under 	 ground 	 	.
In	a	single	cubic	inch	of	 s 	 oil 	 	,	there	can	be	more	than	eight	 mile 	 s 	 	of	these	 cell 	 s 	 	.
My	foot	is	 cover 	 ing 	 	 approximate 	 ly 	 	300	 mile 	 s 	 	of	 mycel 	 ium 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 photo 	 micro 	 graph 	 s 	 	from	Nick	Read	and	 Pa 	 trick 	 	 Hic 	 key 	 	.
And	notice	that	 a 	 s 	 	the	 mycel 	 ium 	 	 grow 	 s 	 	,	it	 conquer 	 s 	 	 territ 	 ory 	 	and	then	it	 begin 	 s 	 	the	net	.
I	've	 be 	 en 	 	a	 s 	 canning 	 	electron	 micro 	 scopist 	 	for	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	,	I	have	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	electron	 micro 	 graph 	 s 	 	,	and	when	I	'm	 star 	 ing 	 	at	the	 mycel 	 ium 	 	,	I	 real 	 ize 	 	that	they	are	 micro 	 filtration 	 	 membrane 	 s 	 	.
We	 exhal 	 e 	 	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	,	so	 do 	 es 	 	 mycel 	 ium 	 	.
It	 inhal 	 es 	 	oxygen	,	just	like	we	do	.
But	these	are	 essential 	 ly 	 	 external 	 ized 	 	 stomach 	 s 	 	and	 lung 	 s 	 	.
And	I	present	to	you	a	 con 	 cept 	 	that	these	are	 extend 	 ed 	 	 neuro 	 logical 	 	 membrane 	 s 	 	.
And	in	these	 cav 	 ities 	 	,	these	 micro 	 - 	 cav 	 ities 	 	form	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	they	fuse	 s 	 oil 	 s 	 	,	they	absorb	water	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	little	 well 	 s 	 	.
And	 in 	 side 	 	these	 well 	 s 	 	,	then	 micro 	 bi 	 al 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	begin	to	form	.
And	so	the	spongy	 s 	 oil 	 	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 resist 	 s 	 	 ero 	 s 	 ion 	 	,	but	 set 	 s 	 	up	a	 micro 	 bi 	 al 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 	that	 give 	 s 	 	rise	to	a	 plural 	 ity 	 	of	other	 organism 	 s 	 	.
I	first	 pro 	 posed 	 	,	in	the	early	1990s	,	that	 mycel 	 ium 	 	is	Earth	's	natural	Internet	.
When	you	look	at	the	 mycel 	 ium 	 	,	they	're	 high 	 ly 	 	 branch 	 ed 	 	.
And	if	there	's	one	branch	that	is	broken	,	then	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 nod 	 es 	 	of	 cross 	 ing 	 	--	Internet	 engineer 	 s 	 	 may 	 be 	 	call	them	hot	 point 	 s 	 	--	there	are	 alter 	 native 	 	 path 	 ways 	 	for	 channel 	 ing 	 	 nutrient 	 s 	 	and	information	.
The	 mycel 	 ium 	 	is	 senti 	 ent 	 	.
It	 know 	 s 	 	that	you	are	there	.
When	you	walk	 a 	 cross 	 	 land 	 scapes 	 	,	it	 leap 	 s 	 	up	in	the	 after 	 math 	 	of	your	 foot 	 step 	 s 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	grab	 deb 	 ris 	 	.
So	,	I	 believ 	 e 	 	the	 invent 	 ion 	 	of	the	computer	Internet	is	an	 inevit 	 able 	 	 con 	 sequence 	 	of	a	 previous 	 ly 	 	proven	,	 bio 	 logically 	 	 success 	 ful 	 	model	.
The	Earth	 invent 	 ed 	 	the	computer	Internet	for	 it 	 s 	 	own	benefit	,	and	we	now	,	 be 	 ing 	 	the	top	organism	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	,	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 al 	 locate 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	in	order	to	protect	the	 bio 	 sphere 	 	.
 Go 	 ing 	 	way	out	,	dark	matter	 conform 	 s 	 	to	the	same	 mycel 	 ial 	 	 arche 	 type 	 	.
I	 believ 	 e 	 	matter	 be 	 get 	 s 	 	life	;	life	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	single	 cell 	 s 	 	;	single	 cell 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 string 	 s 	 	;	 string 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 chain 	 s 	 	;	 chain 	 s 	 	network	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	paradigm	that	we	see	 through 	 out 	 	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
 Mo 	 st 	 	of	you	may	not	know	that	fungi	 we 	 re 	 	the	first	 organism 	 s 	 	to	come	to	land	.
 The 	 y 	 	came	to	land	1.3	billion	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	and	 plant 	 s 	 	 follow 	 ed 	 	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	hundred	million	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	.
How	is	that	possible	?
It	's	possible	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 mycel 	 ium 	 	 produce 	 s 	 	 oxal 	 ic 	 	 acid 	 s 	 	,	and	 man 	 y 	 	other	 acid 	 s 	 	and	 enzyme 	 s 	 	,	 pock 	 mark 	 ing 	 	rock	and	 grab 	 bing 	 	 calc 	 ium 	 	and	other	 mineral 	 s 	 	and	 form 	 ing 	 	 calc 	 ium 	 	 oxal 	 ates 	 	.
 Make 	 s 	 	the	 rock 	 s 	 	 crumb 	 le 	 	,	and	the	first	step	in	the	generation	of	 s 	 oil 	 	.
Oxalic	acid	is	two	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	 molecule 	 s 	 	 join 	 ed 	 	together	.
So	,	fungi	and	 mycel 	 ium 	 	 sequest 	 er 	 	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	in	the	form	of	 calc 	 ium 	 	 oxal 	 ates 	 	.
And	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	other	 oxal 	 ates 	 	are	 al 	 so 	 	 sequest 	 er 	 ing 	 	carbon	 di 	 oxide 	 	through	the	 mineral 	 s 	 	that	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 form 	 ed 	 	and	taken	out	of	the	rock	 m 	 atrix 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	was	first	 discover 	 ed 	 	in	1859	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	photograph	by	Franz	 Hu 	 e 	 ber 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	photograph	's	taken	1950s	in	Saudi	 Arab 	 ia 	 	.
420	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 th 	 is 	 	organism	 exist 	 ed 	 	.
It	was	 call 	 ed 	 	 Pro 	 to 	 tax 	 ites 	 	.
 Pro 	 to 	 tax 	 ites 	 	,	 lay 	 ing 	 	down	,	was	about	three	feet	tall	.
The	 tall 	 est 	 	 plant 	 s 	 	on	Earth	at	that	time	 we 	 re 	 	less	than	two	feet	.
 Dr 	 . 	 	 Boy 	 ce 	 	,	at	the	 Univers 	 ity 	 	of	 Chi 	 cago 	 	,	 publish 	 ed 	 	an	article	in	the	Journal	of	 Geo 	 logy 	 	 th 	 is 	 	past	year	 determi 	 ning 	 	that	 Pro 	 to 	 tax 	 ites 	 	was	a	giant	fungus	,	a	giant	mushroom	.
 A 	 cross 	 	the	 land 	 scapes 	 	of	Earth	 we 	 re 	 	 dot 	 ted 	 	these	giant	 mushroom 	 s 	 	.
All	 a 	 cross 	 	most	land	 masse 	 s 	 	.
And	these	 exist 	 ed 	 	for	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	we	've	had	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 extinct 	 ion 	 	 event 	 s 	 	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	we	march	forward	--	65	million	 year 	 s 	 	ago	--	most	of	you	know	about	it	--	we	had	an	 a 	 steroid 	 	impact	.
The	Earth	was	 s 	 truck 	 	by	an	 a 	 steroid 	 	,	a	huge	amount	of	 deb 	 ris 	 	was	 jettison 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	atmosphere	.
 Sun 	 light 	 	was	cut	off	,	and	fungi	 inherit 	 ed 	 	the	Earth	.
 T 	 hose 	 	 organism 	 s 	 	that	 pair 	 ed 	 	with	fungi	 we 	 re 	 	 reward 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	fungi	do	not	need	light	.
 Mo 	 re 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	at	Einstein	 Univers 	 ity 	 	,	they	just	 determine 	 d 	 	that	fungi	use	 radi 	 ation 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	source	of	energy	,	much	like	 plant 	 s 	 	use	light	.
So	,	the	prospect	of	fungi	 exist 	 ing 	 	on	other	 planet 	 s 	 	 else 	 where 	 	,	I	think	,	is	a	 for 	 gone 	 	 con 	 clusion 	 	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	in	my	own	mind	.
The	largest	organism	in	the	world	is	in	 East 	 ern 	 	Oregon	.
I	could	n't	 mis 	 s 	 	it	.	It	was	2,200	 acre 	 s 	 	in	 s 	 ize 	 	:	2,200	 acre 	 s 	 	in	 s 	 ize 	 	,	2,000	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
The	largest	organism	on	the	planet	is	a	 mycel 	 ial 	 	mat	,	one	cell	wall	thick	.
How	is	it	that	 th 	 is 	 	organism	can	be	so	large	,	and	yet	be	one	cell	wall	thick	,	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	we	have	five	or	six	skin	 layer 	 s 	 	that	protect	us	?
The	 mycel 	 ium 	 	,	in	the	right	 condition 	 s 	 	,	 produce 	 s 	 	a	mushroom	--	it	 burst 	 s 	 	through	with	 s 	 uch 	 	 fer 	 o 	 city 	 	that	it	can	break	asphalt	.
We	 we 	 re 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	with	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 experiment 	 s 	 	.
I	'm	going	to	show	you	six	,	if	I	can	,	 solution 	 s 	 	for	 help 	 ing 	 	to	 s 	 ave 	 	the	world	.
 Bat 	 tell 	 e 	 	 Labor 	 ator 	 ies 	 	and	I	 join 	 ed 	 	up	in	 Bell 	 ing 	 ham 	 	,	 Wash 	 ington 	 	.
There	 we 	 re 	 	four	 pile 	 s 	 	 saturate 	 d 	 	with	 dies 	 el 	 	and	other	petroleum	waste	:	one	was	a	control	pile	;	one	pile	was	 treat 	 ed 	 	with	 enzyme 	 s 	 	;	one	pile	was	 treat 	 ed 	 	with	bacteria	;	and	our	pile	we	 inocul 	 ated 	 	with	mushroom	 mycel 	 ium 	 	.
The	 mycel 	 ium 	 	 absorb 	 s 	 	the	oil	.
The	 mycel 	 ium 	 	is	producing	 enzyme 	 s 	 	--	 per 	 oxid 	 ase 	 s 	 	--	that	break	 carbon 	 - 	 hydrogen 	 	 bond 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	the	same	 bond 	 s 	 	that	hold	 hydro 	 carbon 	 s 	 	together	.
So	,	the	 mycel 	 ium 	 	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 saturate 	 d 	 	with	the	oil	,	and	then	,	when	we	 return 	 ed 	 	six	 week 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	all	the	 tarp 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	,	all	the	other	 pile 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	dead	,	dark	and	 stink 	 y 	 	.
We	came	back	to	our	pile	,	it	was	 cover 	 ed 	 	with	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 pound 	 s 	 	of	oyster	 mushroom 	 s 	 	,	and	the	color	 change 	 d 	 	to	a	light	form	.
The	 enzyme 	 s 	 	 re 	 manufactur 	 ed 	 	the	 hydro 	 carbon 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 carbohydrate 	 s 	 	--	 f 	 ung 	 al 	 	 sugar 	 s 	 	.
Some	of	these	 mushroom 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	happy	 mushroom 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	 ver 	 y 	 	large	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	 show 	 ing 	 	how	much	nutrition	that	they	could	've	 obtain 	 ed 	 	.
But	 some 	 thing 	 	else	 happen 	 ed 	 	,	which	was	an	 epiph 	 any 	 	in	my	life	.
 The 	 y 	 	 sporulat 	 ed 	 	,	the	 s 	 pore 	 s 	 	attract	 insect 	 s 	 	,	the	 insect 	 s 	 	laid	 egg 	 s 	 	,	 egg 	 s 	 	 be 	 came 	 	 larva 	 e 	 	.
 Bird 	 s 	 	then	came	,	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	in	 seed 	 s 	 	,	and	our	pile	 be 	 came 	 	an	 oa 	 sis 	 	of	life	.
 Where 	 a 	 s 	 	the	other	three	 pile 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	dead	,	dark	and	 stink 	 y 	 	,	and	the	 PA 	 H 	 	's	--	the	 aroma 	 tic 	 	 hydro 	 carbon 	 s 	 	--	went	from	10,000	 part 	 s 	 	per	million	to	less	than	200	in	eight	 week 	 s 	 	.
The	last	image	we	do	n't	have	.
The	entire	pile	was	a	green	berm	of	life	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	 gate 	 way 	 	species	,	 van 	 guard 	 	species	that	open	the	door	for	other	 bio 	 logical 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	.
So	I	 invent 	 ed 	 	 bur 	 lap 	 	 s 	 ack 	 s 	 	,	 bunk 	 er 	 	spawn	--	and	 put 	 ting 	 	the	 mycel 	 ium 	 	--	using	storm	blown	 deb 	 ris 	 	,	you	can	take	these	 bur 	 lap 	 	 s 	 ack 	 s 	 	and	put	them	 down 	 stream 	 	from	a	farm	that	's	producing	E.	coli	,	or	other	 waste 	 s 	 	,	or	a	 factor 	 y 	 	with	chemical	 toxin 	 s 	 	,	and	it	 lead 	 s 	 	to	 habit 	 at 	 	 resto 	 ration 	 	.
So	,	we	set	up	a	 s 	 ite 	 	in	 Ma 	 son 	 	 Count 	 y 	 	,	 Wash 	 ington 	 	,	and	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	a	 dramat 	 ic 	 	 de 	 crease 	 	in	the	amount	of	 coli 	 form 	 s 	 	.
And	I	'll	show	you	a	graph	here	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	 log 	 arithmic 	 	scale	,	10	to	the	eighth	power	.
There	's	more	than	a	100	million	 colon 	 ies 	 	per	gram	,	and	10	to	the	third	power	is	around	1,000	.
In	48	 hour 	 s 	 	to	72	 hour 	 s 	 	,	these	three	mushroom	species	 reduc 	 ed 	 	the	amount	of	 coli 	 form 	 	bacteria	10,000	 time 	 s 	 	.
Think	of	the	 implic 	 ations 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	 space 	 - 	 conserv 	 ative 	 	method	that	uses	storm	 deb 	 ris 	 	--	and	we	can	guarantee	that	we	will	have	 storm 	 s 	 	every	year	.
So	,	 th 	 is 	 	one	mushroom	,	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	drawn	our	interest	over	time	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	my	wife	 Dust 	 y 	 	,	with	a	mushroom	 call 	 ed 	 	Fomitopsis	 off 	 icinalis 	 	--	 Aga 	 rikon 	 	.
It	's	a	mushroom	exclusive	to	the	 old 	 - 	 growth 	 	forest	that	 Diosco 	 ride 	 s 	 	first	 de 	 scribed 	 	in	65	 A. 	 D 	 	.
 a 	 s 	 	a	 treat 	 ment 	 	against	consumption	.
 Th 	 is 	 	mushroom	 grow 	 s 	 	in	 Wash 	 ington 	 	 Stat 	 e 	 	,	Oregon	,	 north 	 ern 	 	California	,	 Brit 	 ish 	 	Columbia	,	now	thought	to	be	extinct	in	 Euro 	 pe 	 	.
May	not	seem	that	large	--	let	's	get	 close 	 r 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	rare	fungus	.
Our	team	--	and	we	have	a	team	of	 expert 	 s 	 	that	go	out	--	we	went	out	20	 time 	 s 	 	in	the	 old 	 - 	 growth 	 	forest	last	year	.
We	found	one	 s 	 ample 	 	to	be	able	to	get	 in 	 to 	 	culture	.
 Pre 	 serv 	 ing 	 	the	genome	of	these	fungi	in	the	 old 	 - 	 growth 	 	forest	I	think	is	 absolute 	 ly 	 	critical	for	human	health	.
I	've	 be 	 en 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	with	the	U.S.	 Defe 	 ns 	 e 	 	Department	 Bio 	 Shield 	 	program	.
We	 submit 	 ted 	 	over	300	 s 	 ample 	 s 	 	of	 mushroom 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 boil 	 ed 	 	in	hot	water	,	and	 mycel 	 ium 	 	 harvest 	 ing 	 	these	 extra 	 cellular 	 	 metabol 	 ites 	 	.
And	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	we	 receiv 	 ed 	 	these	 result 	 s 	 	.
We	have	three	different	 s 	 train 	 s 	 	of	 Aga 	 rikon 	 	 mushroom 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 high 	 ly 	 	active	against	 pox 	 viruses 	 	.
 Dr 	 . 	 	 Ear 	 l 	 	 Ker 	 n 	 	,	who	's	a	 small 	 pox 	 	expert	of	the	U.S.	 Defe 	 ns 	 e 	 	Department	,	 state 	 s 	 	that	any	 com 	 pound 	 s 	 	that	have	a	 select 	 ivity 	 	index	of	two	or	more	are	active	.
10	or	 great 	 er 	 	are	 consider 	 ed 	 	to	be	 ver 	 y 	 	active	.
Our	mushroom	 s 	 train 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	in	the	 high 	 ly 	 	active	range	.
There	's	a	 vet 	 ted 	 	press	 re 	 lease 	 	that	you	can	read	--	it	's	 vet 	 ted 	 	by	 DO 	 D 	 	--	if	you	Google	``	Stamets	''	and	``	 small 	 pox 	 	.	''
Or	you	can	go	to	 N 	 PR 	 .org 	 	and	listen	to	a	live	interview	.
So	,	 encourag 	 ed 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	,	 natural 	 ly 	 	we	went	to	flu	viruses	.
And	so	,	for	the	first	time	,	I	am	 show 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
We	have	three	different	 s 	 train 	 s 	 	of	 Aga 	 rikon 	 	 mushroom 	 s 	 	 high 	 ly 	 	active	against	flu	viruses	.
 He 	 re 	 	's	the	 select 	 ivity 	 	index	 number 	 s 	 	--	against	pox	,	you	saw	10s	and	20s	--	now	against	flu	viruses	,	 compar 	 ed 	 	to	the	ribavirin	 control 	 s 	 	,	we	have	an	 extra 	 ordinari 	 ly 	 	high	activity	.
And	we	're	using	a	natural	 ex 	 tract 	 	 with 	 in 	 	the	same	 do 	 s 	 age 	 	window	 a 	 s 	 	a	 pur 	 e 	 	pharmaceutical	.
We	 tri 	 ed 	 	it	against	flu	A	viruses	--	 H1N 	 1 	 	,	 H3N 	 2 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	flu	B	viruses	.
So	then	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	a	blend	,	and	in	a	blend	combination	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	it	against	 H5N 	 1 	 	,	and	we	got	 great 	 er 	 	than	1,000	 select 	 ivity 	 	index	.
I	then	think	that	we	can	make	the	argument	that	we	should	 s 	 ave 	 	the	 old 	 - 	 growth 	 	forest	 a 	 s 	 	a	matter	of	national	defense	.
I	 be 	 came 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 entomo 	 pathogen 	 ic 	 	fungi	--	fungi	that	kill	 insect 	 s 	 	.
Our	house	was	 be 	 ing 	 	 destroy 	 ed 	 	by	 carp 	 enter 	 	ants	.
So	,	I	went	to	the	 E 	 PA 	 	 home 	 page 	 	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 recommend 	 ing 	 	 stud 	 ies 	 	with	 meta 	 rhiz 	 ium 	 	species	of	a	group	of	fungi	that	kill	 carp 	 enter 	 	ants	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	 term 	 ites 	 	.
I	did	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 no 	 body 	 	else	had	 d 	 one 	 	.
I	 actual 	 ly 	 	 chase 	 d 	 	the	 mycel 	 ium 	 	,	when	it	 stop 	 ped 	 	producing	 s 	 pore 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	 s 	 pore 	 s 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 s 	 pore 	 s 	 	.
I	was	able	to	morph	the	culture	 in 	 to 	 	a	 non 	 - 	 sporulat 	 ing 	 	form	.
And	so	the	industry	 ha 	 s 	 	 s 	 pent 	 	over	100	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	 specific 	 ally 	 	on	bait	 station 	 s 	 	to	prevent	 term 	 ites 	 	from	eating	your	house	.
But	the	 insect 	 s 	 	are	n't	stupid	,	and	they	would	avoid	the	 s 	 pore 	 s 	 	when	they	came	close	,	and	so	I	 morph 	 ed 	 	the	 culture 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	 non 	 - 	 sporulat 	 ing 	 	form	.
And	I	got	my	daughter	's	Barbie	doll	dish	,	I	put	it	right	where	a	bunch	of	 carp 	 enter 	 	ants	 we 	 re 	 	making	 deb 	 ris 	 	 field 	 s 	 	,	every	day	,	in	my	house	,	and	the	ants	 we 	 re 	 	 attract 	 ed 	 	to	the	 mycel 	 ium 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	no	 s 	 pore 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	it	to	the	 que 	 en 	 	.
One	week	 lat 	 er 	 	,	I	had	no	 saw 	 dust 	 	 pile 	 s 	 	 what 	 so 	 ever 	 	.
And	then	--	a	 delic 	 ate 	 	dance	between	 d 	 inner 	 	and	death	--	the	 mycel 	 ium 	 	is	 consum 	 ed 	 	by	the	ants	,	they	 be 	 come 	 	 mum 	 m 	 ified 	 	,	and	,	 bo 	 ing 	 	,	a	mushroom	 pop 	 s 	 	out	of	 the 	 ir 	 	head	.
 N 	 ow 	 	after	 sporulat 	 ion 	 	,	the	 s 	 pore 	 s 	 	repel	.
So	,	the	house	is	no	 long 	 er 	 	 suit 	 able 	 	for	invasion	.
So	,	you	have	a	 near 	 - 	 permanent 	 	solution	for	 re 	 invasion 	 	of	 term 	 ites 	 	.
And	so	my	house	came	down	,	I	 receiv 	 ed 	 	my	first	patent	against	 carp 	 enter 	 	ants	,	 term 	 ites 	 	and	fire	ants	.
 Th 	 en 	 	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	 ex 	 tract 	 s 	 	,	and	lo	and	 be 	 hold 	 	,	we	can	steer	 insect 	 s 	 	to	different	 direction 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	huge	 implic 	 ations 	 	.
I	then	 receiv 	 ed 	 	my	second	patent	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	big	one	.
It	's	 be 	 en 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	an	 Alexa 	 nder 	 	 Gra 	 ham 	 	Bell	patent	.
It	 cover 	 s 	 	over	200,000	species	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	most	 disrupt 	 ive 	 	technology	--	I	've	 be 	 en 	 	told	by	 ex 	 ecutive 	 s 	 	of	the	 pest 	 icide 	 	industry	--	that	they	have	ever	 witness 	 ed 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	could	 total 	 ly 	 	revamp	the	 pest 	 icide 	 	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	 through 	 out 	 	the	world	.
You	could	fly	100	 Ph.D 	 . 	 	 student 	 s 	 	under	the	 um 	 br 	 ella 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 cept 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	my	 s 	 up 	 position 	 	is	that	 entomo 	 pathogen 	 ic 	 	fungi	,	prior	to	 sporulat 	 ion 	 	,	attract	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 insect 	 s 	 	that	are	 other 	 wise 	 	 repel 	 led 	 	by	 t 	 hose 	 	 s 	 pore 	 s 	 	.
And	so	I	came	up	with	a	Life	Box	,	 be 	 cause 	 	I	 need 	 ed 	 	a	 deliver 	 y 	 	system	.
The	Life	Box	--	you	're	gon	na	be	 get 	 ting 	 	a	DVD	of	the	TED	 con 	 ference 	 	--	you	add	 s 	 oil 	 	,	you	add	water	,	you	have	 myco 	 rrhizal 	 	and	 endo 	 phy 	 tic 	 	fungi	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	 s 	 pore 	 s 	 	,	like	of	the	 Aga 	 rikon 	 	mushroom	.
The	 seed 	 s 	 	then	are	 mother 	 ed 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	 mycel 	 ium 	 	.
And	then	you	put	tree	 seed 	 s 	 	in	here	,	and	then	you	end	up	growing	--	 potential 	 ly 	 	--	an	 old 	 - 	 growth 	 	forest	from	a	 card 	 board 	 	box	.
I	want	to	 re 	 invent 	 	the	 deliver 	 y 	 	system	,	and	the	use	of	 card 	 board 	 	around	the	world	,	so	they	 be 	 come 	 	 eco 	 logical 	 	 foot 	 print 	 s 	 	.
If	there	's	a	 YouTube 	 - 	 like 	 	 s 	 ite 	 	that	you	could	put	up	,	you	could	make	it	 inter 	 active 	 	,	zip	code	specific	--	where	people	could	join	together	,	and	through	satellite	 im 	 aging 	 	 system 	 s 	 	,	through	Virtual	Earth	or	Google	Earth	,	you	could	confirm	carbon	 credit 	 s 	 	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 sequest 	 er 	 ed 	 	by	the	 tree 	 s 	 	that	are	coming	through	Life	 Box 	 es 	 	.
You	could	take	a	 card 	 board 	 	box	 deliver 	 ing 	 	 shoe 	 s 	 	,	you	could	add	water	--	I	 develop 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	for	the	 refuge 	 e 	 	community	--	 corn 	 s 	 	,	 bean 	 s 	 	and	squash	and	 on 	 ions 	 	.
I	took	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 contain 	 ers 	 	--	my	wife	 s 	 aid 	 	,	if	I	could	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	 any 	 body 	 	could	--	and	I	 end 	 ed 	 	up	growing	a	seed	garden	.
 Th 	 en 	 	you	harvest	the	 seed 	 s 	 	--	and	thank	you	,	 Er 	 ic 	 	 Ra 	 smussen 	 	,	for	your	help	on	 th 	 is 	 	--	and	then	you	're	 harvest 	 ing 	 	the	seed	garden	.
 Th 	 en 	 	you	can	harvest	the	 ker 	 nel 	 s 	 	,	and	then	you	just	need	a	few	 ker 	 nel 	 s 	 	.
I	add	 mycel 	 ium 	 	to	it	,	and	then	I	 inocul 	 ate 	 	the	 corn 	 cob 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	three	 corn 	 cob 	 s 	 	,	no	other	grain	--	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 mushroom 	 s 	 	begin	to	form	.
Too	 man 	 y 	 	 withdraw 	 al 	 s 	 	from	the	carbon	bank	,	and	so	 th 	 is 	 	population	will	be	shut	down	.
But	watch	what	 happen 	 s 	 	here	.
The	 mushroom 	 s 	 	then	are	 harvest 	 ed 	 	,	but	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	the	 mycel 	 ium 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 convert 	 ed 	 	the	 cell 	 u 	 lose 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 f 	 ung 	 al 	 	 sugar 	 s 	 	.
And	so	I	thought	,	how	could	we	address	the	energy	crisis	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	?
And	we	came	up	with	 Eco 	 nol 	 	.
 Gene 	 rating 	 	ethanol	from	 cell 	 u 	 lose 	 	using	 mycel 	 ium 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	 inter 	 media 	 ry 	 	--	and	you	gain	all	the	 benefit 	 s 	 	that	I	've	 de 	 scribed 	 	to	you	 al 	 ready 	 	.
But	to	go	from	 cell 	 u 	 lose 	 	to	ethanol	is	 eco 	 logically 	 	 un 	 intelligent 	 	,	and	I	think	that	we	need	to	be	 eco 	 no 	 logically 	 	intelligent	about	the	generation	of	 fuel 	 s 	 	.
So	,	we	build	the	carbon	 bank 	 s 	 	on	the	planet	,	renew	the	 s 	 oil 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	a	species	that	we	need	to	join	with	.
I	think	 engag 	 ing 	 	 mycel 	 ium 	 	can	help	 s 	 ave 	 	the	world	.
Thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.

Stacey	 Kra 	 mer 	 	:	The	best	gift	I	ever	 surviv 	 ed 	 
 Imagin 	 e 	 	,	if	you	will	--	a	gift	.
I	'd	like	for	you	to	picture	it	in	your	mind	.
It	's	not	too	big	--	about	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	a	golf	ball	.
So	envision	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	all	 wrap 	 ped 	 	up	.
But	before	I	show	you	what	's	 in 	 side 	 	,	I	will	tell	you	,	it	's	going	to	do	 in 	 credible 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	for	you	.
It	will	 br 	 ing 	 	all	of	your	family	together	.
You	will	feel	 love 	 d 	 	and	 appreciate 	 d 	 	like	never	before	and	 re 	 connect 	 	with	 friend 	 s 	 	and	 acquaint 	 ance 	 s 	 	you	have	n't	heard	from	in	 year 	 s 	 	.
 Adora 	 tion 	 	and	 admi 	 ration 	 	will	overwhelm	you	.
It	will	 re 	 calibrate 	 	what	's	most	 import 	 ant 	 	in	your	life	.
It	will	 re 	 define 	 	your	sense	of	 spiritual 	 ity 	 	and	faith	.
You	'll	have	a	new	 understand 	 ing 	 	and	trust	in	your	body	.
You	'll	have	 un 	 surpass 	 ed 	 	 vital 	 ity 	 	and	energy	.
You	'll	expand	your	 vocabul 	 ary 	 	,	meet	new	people	,	and	you	'll	have	a	 health 	 ier 	 	 life 	 style 	 	.

You	'll	eat	 count 	 less 	 	gourmet	 meal 	 s 	 	.

The	price	?
$	55,000	,	and	that	's	an	 in 	 credible 	 	deal	.
By	now	I	know	you	're	 dy 	 ing 	 	to	know	what	it	is	and	where	you	can	get	one	.
 Do 	 es 	 	Amazon	carry	it	?
 Do 	 es 	 	it	have	the	Apple	logo	on	it	?
 I 	 s 	 	there	a	 wait 	 ing 	 	list	?
Not	 like 	 ly 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	gift	came	to	me	about	five	 month 	 s 	 	ago	.
It	 look 	 ed 	 	more	like	 th 	 is 	 	when	it	was	all	 wrap 	 ped 	 	up	--	not	 quit 	 e 	 	so	 pre 	 tty 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	then	 th 	 is 	 	.
It	was	a	rare	gem	--	a	brain	tumor	,	hemangioblastoma	--	the	gift	that	 keep 	 s 	 	on	giving	.
And	while	I	'm	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	now	,	I	would	n't	wish	 th 	 is 	 	gift	for	you	.
I	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	you	'd	want	it	.

Why	do	we	 crav 	 e 	 	love	so	much	,	even	to	the	point	that	we	would	die	for	it	?	To	learn	more	about	our	 ver 	 y 	 	real	,	 ver 	 y 	 	physical	need	for	romantic	love	,	Helen	 Fish 	 er 	 	and	her	research	team	took	 MRI 	 s 	 	of	people	in	love	--	and	people	who	had	just	 be 	 en 	 	 dump 	 ed 	 	.

Helen	 Fish 	 er 	 	 stud 	 ies 	 	the	brain	in	love
I	and	my	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	Art	 Ar 	 on 	 	and	 Luc 	 y 	 	Brown	and	 other 	 s 	 	,	have	put	37	people	who	are	 mad 	 ly 	 	in	love	 in 	 to 	 	a	functional	MRI	brain	scanner	.
17	who	 we 	 re 	 	 hap 	 pi 	 ly 	 	in	love	,	15	who	had	just	 be 	 en 	 	 dump 	 ed 	 	,	and	we	're	just	 start 	 ing 	 	our	third	experiment	:	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	people	who	report	that	they	're	still	in	love	after	10	to	25	 year 	 s 	 	of	marriage	.
So	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	short	story	of	that	research	.
In	the	 jungle 	 s 	 	of	 Gua 	 temala 	 	,	in	Tikal	,	 stand 	 s 	 	a	temple	.
It	was	built	by	the	 grand 	 est 	 	Sun	 K 	 ing 	 	,	of	the	 grand 	 est 	 	 city 	 - 	 state 	 	,	of	the	 grand 	 est 	 	 civil 	 ization 	 	of	the	 America 	 s 	 	,	the	 Maya 	 s 	 	.
 Hi 	 s 	 	name	was	 Ja 	 saw 	 	Chan	K'awiil	.
He	stood	over	six	feet	tall	.
He	lived	 in 	 to 	 	his	80s	,	and	he	was	buried	 be 	 neath 	 	 th 	 is 	 	monument	in	720	AD	.
And	 May 	 an 	 	 in 	 script 	 ions 	 	 pro 	 claim 	 	that	he	was	 deep 	 ly 	 	in	love	with	his	wife	.
So	,	he	built	a	temple	in	her	honor	,	facing	his	.
And	every	spring	and	 aut 	 umn 	 	,	 exact 	 ly 	 	at	the	 equi 	 nox 	 	,	the	 s 	 un 	 	 rise 	 s 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	his	temple	,	and	 perfect 	 ly 	 	 bath 	 es 	 	her	temple	with	his	shadow	.
And	 a 	 s 	 	the	 s 	 un 	 	 set 	 s 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	her	temple	in	the	afternoon	,	it	 perfect 	 ly 	 	 bath 	 es 	 	his	temple	with	her	shadow	.
After	1,300	 year 	 s 	 	,	these	two	 lover 	 s 	 	still	touch	and	kiss	from	 the 	 ir 	 	tomb	.
 A 	 round 	 	the	world	,	people	love	.
 The 	 y 	 	 s 	 ing 	 	for	love	,	they	dance	for	love	,	they	compose	 poem 	 s 	 	and	 st 	 ories 	 	about	love	.
 The 	 y 	 	tell	 myth 	 s 	 	and	 legend 	 s 	 	about	love	.
 The 	 y 	 	pine	for	love	,	they	live	for	love	,	they	kill	for	love	,	and	they	die	for	love	.
 A 	 s 	 	Walt	 Whi 	 t 	 man 	 	once	 s 	 aid 	 	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Oh	,	I	would	 s 	 take 	 	all	for	you	.	''
 Anthropo 	 logists 	 	have	found	evidence	of	romantic	love	in	170	 socie 	 ties 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	've	never	found	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	that	did	not	have	it	.
But	love	is	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	a	happy	experience	.
In	one	 stud 	 y 	 	of	college	 student 	 s 	 	,	they	 ask 	 ed 	 	a	lot	of	 question 	 s 	 	about	love	,	but	the	two	that	stood	out	to	me	the	most	 we 	 re 	 	,	``	 Hav 	 e 	 	you	ever	 be 	 en 	 	 reject 	 ed 	 	by	 some 	 body 	 	who	you	 re 	 ally 	 	 love 	 d 	 	?	''
And	the	second	question	was	,	``	 Hav 	 e 	 	you	ever	 dump 	 ed 	 	 some 	 body 	 	who	 re 	 ally 	 	 love 	 d 	 	you	?	''
And	 al 	 most 	 	95	percent	of	both	men	and	women	 s 	 aid 	 	 y 	 es 	 	to	both	.
 Al 	 most 	 	 no 	 body 	 	 get 	 s 	 	out	of	love	 al 	 ive 	 	.
So	,	before	I	start	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	about	the	brain	,	I	want	to	read	for	you	what	I	think	is	the	most	 power 	 ful 	 	love	poem	on	Earth	.
There	's	other	love	 poem 	 s 	 	that	are	,	of	course	,	just	 a 	 s 	 	good	,	but	I	do	n't	think	 th 	 is 	 	one	can	be	 surpass 	 ed 	 	.
It	was	told	by	an	 anonym 	 ous 	 	 Kwa 	 kiutl 	 	Indian	of	southern	Alaska	to	a	 mission 	 ary 	 	in	1896	,	and	here	it	is	.
I	've	never	had	the	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	say	it	before	.
``	Fire	 run 	 s 	 	through	my	body	with	the	pain	of	loving	you	.
 Pa 	 in 	 	 run 	 s 	 	through	my	body	with	the	 fire 	 s 	 	of	my	love	for	you	.
 Pa 	 in 	 	like	a	boil	about	to	burst	with	my	love	for	you	,	 consum 	 ed 	 	by	fire	with	my	love	for	you	.
I	remember	what	you	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	.
I	am	 think 	 ing 	 	of	your	love	for	me	.
I	am	torn	by	your	love	for	me	.
 Pa 	 in 	 	and	more	pain	--	where	are	you	going	with	my	love	?
I	am	told	you	will	go	from	here	.
I	am	told	you	will	 leav 	 e 	 	me	here	.
My	body	is	numb	with	grief	.
 Re 	 member 	 	what	I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	my	love	.
 Good 	 bye 	 	,	my	love	,	 good 	 bye 	 	.	''
 Emil 	 y 	 	 Dick 	 in 	 son 	 	once	wrote	,	``	 Part 	 ing 	 	is	all	we	need	to	know	of	hell	.	''
How	 man 	 y 	 	people	have	 suffer 	 ed 	 	in	all	the	 million 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	of	human	evolution	?
How	 man 	 y 	 	people	around	the	world	are	 danc 	 ing 	 	with	 el 	 ation 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	minute	?
 Rom 	 antic 	 	love	is	one	of	the	most	 power 	 ful 	 	 sens 	 ations 	 	on	Earth	.
So	,	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	I	 decide 	 d 	 	to	look	 in 	 to 	 	the	brain	and	 stud 	 y 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 mad 	 ness 	 	.
Our	first	 stud 	 y 	 	of	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	 hap 	 pi 	 ly 	 	in	love	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 wide 	 ly 	 	 public 	 ized 	 	,	so	I	'm	 on 	 ly 	 	going	to	say	a	 ver 	 y 	 	little	about	it	.
We	found	activity	in	a	 tin 	 y 	 	,	little	 factor 	 y 	 	near	the	base	of	the	brain	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 vent 	 ral 	 	 teg 	 mental 	 	area	.
We	found	activity	in	some	 cell 	 s 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 A 	 10 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	,	 cell 	 s 	 	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	make	dopamine	,	a	natural	 stimul 	 ant 	 	,	and	spray	it	to	 man 	 y 	 	brain	 region 	 s 	 	.
 In 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	part	,	the	 V 	 TA 	 	,	is	part	of	the	brain	's	reward	system	.
It	's	way	 be 	 low 	 	your	cognitive	 think 	 ing 	 	process	.
It	's	 be 	 low 	 	your	 emotion 	 s 	 	.
It	's	part	of	what	we	call	the	 reptil 	 ian 	 	core	of	the	brain	,	 associate 	 d 	 	with	 want 	 ing 	 	,	with	 motiv 	 ation 	 	,	with	focus	and	with	 crav 	 ing 	 	.
In	fact	,	the	same	brain	region	where	we	found	activity	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	active	 al 	 so 	 	when	you	feel	the	rush	of	 coca 	 ine 	 	.
But	romantic	love	is	much	more	than	a	 coca 	 ine 	 	high	--	at	 l 	 east 	 	you	come	down	from	 coca 	 ine 	 	.
 Rom 	 antic 	 	love	is	an	obsession	.	It	 possess 	 es 	 	you	.
You	lose	your	sense	of	self	.
You	ca	n't	stop	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 an 	 other 	 	human	 be 	 ing 	 	.
 Some 	 body 	 	is	 camp 	 ing 	 	in	your	head	.
 A 	 s 	 	an	 eighth 	 - 	 century 	 	 Japan 	 ese 	 	poet	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	My	 long 	 ing 	 	had	no	time	when	it	 cease 	 s 	 	.	''
Wild	is	love	.
And	the	obsession	can	get	 wo 	 rse 	 	when	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	 reject 	 ed 	 	.
So	,	right	now	,	 Luc 	 y 	 	Brown	and	I	,	the	 neuro 	 scientist 	 	on	our	project	,	are	looking	at	the	data	of	the	people	who	 we 	 re 	 	put	 in 	 to 	 	the	machine	after	they	had	just	 be 	 en 	 	 dump 	 ed 	 	.
It	was	 ver 	 y 	 	difficult	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 put 	 ting 	 	these	people	in	the	machine	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	in	 s 	 uch 	 	bad	shape	.
So	 any 	 way 	 	,	we	found	activity	in	three	brain	 region 	 s 	 	.
We	found	activity	in	the	brain	region	,	in	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	brain	region	 associate 	 d 	 	with	 intens 	 e 	 	romantic	love	.
What	a	bad	deal	.
You	know	,	when	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	 dump 	 ed 	 	,	the	one	thing	you	love	to	do	is	just	forget	about	 th 	 is 	 	human	 be 	 ing 	 	,	and	then	go	on	with	your	life	--	but	no	,	you	just	love	them	 hard 	 er 	 	.
 A 	 s 	 	the	poet	 T 	 er 	 ence 	 	,	the	 Ro 	 man 	 	poet	once	 s 	 aid 	 	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	The	less	my	hope	,	the	 hot 	 ter 	 	my	love	.	''
And	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	we	now	know	why	.
Two	thousand	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	we	can	explain	 th 	 is 	 	in	the	brain	.
That	brain	system	--	the	reward	system	for	 want 	 ing 	 	,	for	 motiv 	 ation 	 	,	for	 crav 	 ing 	 	,	for	focus	--	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	more	active	when	you	ca	n't	get	what	you	want	.
In	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	life	's	 great 	 est 	 	prize	:	an	appropriate	 mat 	 ing 	 	partner	.
We	found	activity	in	other	brain	 region 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	--	in	a	brain	region	 associate 	 d 	 	with	 calcul 	 ating 	 	 gain 	 s 	 	and	 loss 	 es 	 	.
You	know	,	you	're	 ly 	 ing 	 	there	,	you	're	looking	at	the	picture	,	and	you	're	in	 th 	 is 	 	machine	,	and	you	're	 calcul 	 ating 	 	,	you	know	,	what	went	wrong	.
How	,	you	know	,	what	have	I	lost	?
 A 	 s 	 	a	matter	of	fact	,	 Luc 	 y 	 	and	I	have	a	little	joke	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
It	 come 	 s 	 	from	a	 D 	 avid 	 	 Mam 	 et 	 	play	,	and	there	's	two	con	 artist 	 s 	 	in	the	play	,	and	the	woman	is	 con 	 ning 	 	the	man	,	and	the	man	 look 	 s 	 	at	the	woman	and	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	Oh	,	you	're	a	bad	 p 	 ony 	 	,	I	'm	not	going	to	bet	on	you	.	''
And	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	it	's	 th 	 is 	 	part	of	the	brain	,	the	core	of	the	nucleus	 accu 	 mb 	 en 	 s 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	that	is	 be 	 coming 	 	active	 a 	 s 	 	you	're	 measur 	 ing 	 	your	 gain 	 s 	 	and	 loss 	 es 	 	.
It	's	 al 	 so 	 	the	brain	region	that	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	active	when	you	're	 will 	 ing 	 	to	take	enormous	 risk 	 s 	 	for	huge	 gain 	 s 	 	and	huge	 loss 	 es 	 	.
Last	but	not	 l 	 east 	 	,	we	found	activity	in	a	brain	region	 associate 	 d 	 	with	deep	 attach 	 ment 	 	to	 an 	 other 	 	individual	.
No	wonder	people	suffer	around	the	world	,	and	we	have	so	 man 	 y 	 	 crime 	 s 	 	of	 pass 	 ion 	 	.
When	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	 reject 	 ed 	 	in	love	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	are	you	 engulf 	 ed 	 	with	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	romantic	love	,	but	you	're	 feel 	 ing 	 	deep	 attach 	 ment 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	individual	.
 Mo 	 re 	 over 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	brain	circuit	for	reward	is	 work 	 ing 	 	,	and	you	're	 feel 	 ing 	 	 intens 	 e 	 	energy	,	 intens 	 e 	 	focus	,	 intens 	 e 	 	 motiv 	 ation 	 	and	the	 will 	 ing 	 ness 	 	to	risk	it	all	to	win	life	's	 great 	 est 	 	prize	.
So	,	what	have	I	 learn 	 ed 	 	from	 th 	 is 	 	experiment	that	I	would	like	to	tell	the	world	?
 Fore 	 most 	 	,	I	have	come	to	think	that	romantic	love	is	a	drive	,	a	 bas 	 ic 	 	 mat 	 ing 	 	drive	.
Not	the	 s 	 ex 	 	drive	--	the	 s 	 ex 	 	drive	 get 	 s 	 	you	out	there	,	looking	for	a	whole	range	of	 partner 	 s 	 	.
 Rom 	 antic 	 	love	 en 	 able 	 s 	 	you	to	focus	your	 mat 	 ing 	 	energy	on	just	one	at	a	time	,	 conserv 	 e 	 	your	 mat 	 ing 	 	energy	,	and	start	the	 mat 	 ing 	 	process	with	 th 	 is 	 	single	individual	.
I	think	of	all	the	 poet 	 ry 	 	that	I	've	read	about	romantic	love	,	what	 sum 	 s 	 	it	up	best	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	 s 	 aid 	 	by	Plato	,	over	2,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
He	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	The	god	of	love	 live 	 s 	 	in	a	state	of	need	.
It	is	a	need	.	It	is	an	urge	.
It	is	a	 home 	 o 	 static 	 	 im 	 balance 	 	.
Like	 hung 	 er 	 	and	thirst	,	it	's	 al 	 most 	 	 im 	 possible 	 	to	stamp	out	.	''
I	've	 al 	 so 	 	come	to	 believ 	 e 	 	that	romantic	love	is	an	 addict 	 ion 	 	:	a	 perfect 	 ly 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 addict 	 ion 	 	when	it	's	going	well	,	and	a	 perfect 	 ly 	 	 horr 	 ible 	 	 addict 	 ion 	 	when	it	's	going	 poor 	 ly 	 	.
And	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	all	of	the	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	of	 addict 	 ion 	 	.
You	focus	on	the	person	,	you	 obsess 	 ively 	 	think	about	them	,	you	 crav 	 e 	 	them	,	you	distort	 re 	 ality 	 	,	your	 will 	 ing 	 ness 	 	to	take	enormous	 risk 	 s 	 	to	win	 th 	 is 	 	person	.
And	it	's	got	the	three	main	 character 	 istic 	 s 	 	of	 addict 	 ion 	 	:	 toler 	 ance 	 	,	you	need	to	see	them	more	,	and	more	,	and	more	;	 withdraw 	 al 	 s 	 	;	and	last	,	 re 	 lapse 	 	.
I	've	got	a	girlfriend	who	's	just	 get 	 ting 	 	over	a	 terr 	 ible 	 	love	 af 	 fair 	 	.
It	's	 be 	 en 	 	about	eight	 month 	 s 	 	,	she	's	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	feel	better	.
And	she	was	 driv 	 ing 	 	 a 	 long 	 	in	her	car	the	other	day	,	and	 sudden 	 ly 	 	she	heard	a	song	on	the	car	radio	that	 re 	 minded 	 	her	of	 th 	 is 	 	man	.
And	she	--	not	 on 	 ly 	 	did	the	instant	 crav 	 ing 	 	come	back	,	but	she	had	to	pull	over	from	the	side	of	the	road	and	cry	.
So	,	one	thing	I	would	like	the	medical	community	,	and	the	legal	community	,	and	even	the	college	community	,	to	see	if	they	can	understand	,	that	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	romantic	love	is	one	of	the	most	 addict 	 ive 	 	 sub 	 stance 	 s 	 	on	Earth	.
I	would	 al 	 so 	 	like	to	tell	the	world	that	 animal 	 s 	 	love	.
There	's	not	an	animal	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	that	will	 copul 	 ate 	 	with	 any 	 thing 	 	that	 come 	 s 	 	 a 	 long 	 	.
Too	old	,	too	young	,	too	 scru 	 ffy 	 	,	too	stupid	,	and	they	wo	n't	do	it	.
 Un 	 less 	 	you	're	 s 	 tuck 	 	in	a	 labor 	 atory 	 	cage	--	and	you	know	,	if	you	 s 	 pend 	 	your	entire	life	in	a	little	box	,	you	're	not	going	to	be	 a 	 s 	 	 pick 	 y 	 	about	who	you	have	 s 	 ex 	 	with	--	but	I	've	 look 	 ed 	 	in	a	hundred	species	,	and	 every 	 where 	 	in	the	wild	,	 animal 	 s 	 	have	 favor 	 ites 	 	.
 A 	 s 	 	a	matter	of	fact	 etho 	 logists 	 	know	 th 	 is 	 	.
There	are	over	eight	 word 	 s 	 	for	what	they	call	``	animal	 favor 	 it 	 ism 	 	:	''	 select 	 ive 	 	 pro 	 cept 	 ivity 	 	,	mate	choice	,	female	choice	,	sexual	choice	.
And	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	there	are	now	three	academic	 article 	 s 	 	in	which	they	've	 look 	 ed 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	 attract 	 ion 	 	,	which	may	 on 	 ly 	 	last	for	a	second	,	but	it	's	a	definite	 attract 	 ion 	 	,	and	either	 th 	 is 	 	same	brain	region	,	 th 	 is 	 	reward	system	,	or	the	 chemical 	 s 	 	of	that	reward	system	are	 involve 	 d 	 	.
In	fact	,	I	think	animal	 attract 	 ion 	 	can	be	instant	--	you	can	see	an	elephant	 instant 	 ly 	 	go	for	 an 	 other 	 	elephant	.
And	I	think	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	the	origin	of	what	you	and	I	call	``	love	at	first	sight	.	''
People	have	often	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	 whet 	 her 	 	what	I	know	about	love	 ha 	 s 	 	 spoil 	 ed 	 	it	for	me	.
And	I	just	 simpl 	 y 	 	say	,	``	 Hard 	 ly 	 	.	''
You	can	know	every	single	 ing 	 red 	 ient 	 	in	a	piece	of	chocolate	cake	,	and	then	when	you	 s 	 it 	 	down	and	eat	that	cake	,	you	can	still	feel	that	joy	.
And	 certain 	 ly 	 	,	I	make	all	the	same	 mistak 	 es 	 	that	 every 	 body 	 	else	 do 	 es 	 	too	,	but	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 deepen 	 ed 	 	my	 understand 	 ing 	 	and	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	for	all	human	life	.
 A 	 s 	 	a	matter	of	fact	,	in	New	York	,	I	often	catch	 my 	 self 	 	looking	in	baby	 carriage 	 s 	 	and	 feel 	 ing 	 	a	little	sorry	for	the	 to 	 t 	 	.
And	in	fact	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	I	feel	a	little	sorry	for	the	chicken	on	my	 d 	 inner 	 	plate	,	when	I	think	of	how	 intens 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	brain	system	is	.
Our	 new 	 est 	 	experiment	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 hatch 	 ed 	 	by	my	 col 	 league 	 	,	Art	 Ar 	 on 	 	--	 put 	 ting 	 	people	who	are	 report 	 ing 	 	that	they	are	still	in	love	,	in	a	 long 	 - 	 term 	 	relationship	,	 in 	 to 	 	the	functional	MRI	.
We	've	put	five	people	in	so	far	,	and	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	we	found	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	thing	.	 The 	 y 	 	're	not	 ly 	 ing 	 	.
The	brain	 area 	 s 	 	 associate 	 d 	 	with	 intens 	 e 	 	romantic	love	still	 be 	 come 	 	active	,	25	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	.
There	are	still	 man 	 y 	 	 question 	 s 	 	to	be	 answer 	 ed 	 	and	 ask 	 ed 	 	about	romantic	love	.
The	question	that	I	'm	 work 	 ing 	 	on	right	 th 	 is 	 	minute	--	and	I	'm	 on 	 ly 	 	going	to	say	it	for	a	second	,	and	then	end	--	is	,	why	do	you	fall	in	love	with	one	person	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 an 	 other 	 	?
I	never	would	have	even	thought	to	think	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	 Match 	 .com 	 	,	the	 Internet 	 - 	 d 	 ating 	 	 s 	 ite 	 	,	came	to	me	three	 year 	 s 	 	ago	and	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	that	question	.
And	I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	I	do	n't	know	.
I	know	what	 happen 	 s 	 	in	the	brain	,	when	you	do	 be 	 come 	 	in	love	,	but	I	do	n't	know	why	you	fall	in	love	with	one	person	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 an 	 other 	 	.
And	so	,	I	've	 s 	 pent 	 	the	last	three	 year 	 s 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	.
And	there	are	 man 	 y 	 	 reason 	 s 	 	that	you	fall	in	love	with	one	person	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 an 	 other 	 	,	that	 psycho 	 logists 	 	can	tell	you	.
And	we	tend	to	fall	in	love	with	 some 	 body 	 	from	the	same	 socio 	 economic 	 	 back 	 ground 	 	,	the	same	general	level	of	 intellig 	 ence 	 	,	the	same	general	level	of	good	 look 	 s 	 	,	the	same	religious	 value 	 s 	 	.
Your	 child 	 hood 	 	 certain 	 ly 	 	 play 	 s 	 	a	role	,	but	 no 	 body 	 	 know 	 s 	 	how	.
And	that	's	about	it	,	that	's	all	they	know	.
No	,	they	've	never	found	the	way	two	 personal 	 ities 	 	fit	together	to	make	a	good	relationship	.
So	,	it	 beg 	 an 	 	to	occur	to	me	that	 may 	 be 	 	your	biology	 pull 	 s 	 	you	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	some	people	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 an 	 other 	 	.
And	I	have	 concoct 	 ed 	 	a	 question 	 naire 	 	to	see	to	what	degree	you	express	dopamine	,	serotonin	,	estrogen	and	testosterone	.
I	think	we	've	 evolv 	 ed 	 	four	 ver 	 y 	 	broad	 personal 	 ity 	 	 type 	 s 	 	 associate 	 d 	 	with	the	 ratio 	 s 	 	of	these	four	 chemical 	 s 	 	in	the	brain	.
And	on	 th 	 is 	 	 d 	 ating 	 	 s 	 ite 	 	that	I	have	 create 	 d 	 	,	 call 	 ed 	 	 Chem 	 ist 	 ry 	 .com 	 	,	I	ask	you	first	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 question 	 s 	 	to	see	to	what	degree	you	express	these	 chemical 	 s 	 	,	and	I	'm	 watch 	 ing 	 	who	 choos 	 es 	 	who	to	love	.
And	3.7	million	people	have	taken	the	 question 	 naire 	 	in	America	.
 Ab 	 out 	 	600,000	people	have	taken	it	in	33	other	 count 	 ries 	 	.
I	'm	 put 	 ting 	 	the	data	together	now	,	and	at	some	point	--	there	will	 al 	 ways 	 	be	magic	to	love	,	but	I	think	I	will	come	 close 	 r 	 	to	 understand 	 ing 	 	why	it	is	you	can	walk	 in 	 to 	 	a	room	and	 every 	 body 	 	is	from	your	 back 	 ground 	 	,	your	same	general	level	of	 intellig 	 ence 	 	,	your	same	general	level	of	good	 look 	 s 	 	,	and	you	do	n't	feel	 pull 	 ed 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	all	of	them	.
I	think	there	's	biology	to	that	.
I	think	we	're	going	to	end	up	,	in	the	next	few	 year 	 s 	 	,	to	understand	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	brain	 mechan 	 ism 	 s 	 	that	pull	us	to	one	person	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 an 	 other 	 	.
So	,	I	will	close	with	 th 	 is 	 	.	 Th 	 ese 	 	are	my	 old 	 er 	 	people	.
Faulkner	once	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	The	past	is	not	dead	,	it	's	not	even	the	past	.	''
 In 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	we	carry	a	lot	of	 lugg 	 age 	 	from	our	 yester 	 year 	 	in	the	human	brain	.
And	so	,	there	's	one	thing	that	 make 	 s 	 	me	pursue	my	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	human	nature	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 mind 	 s 	 	me	of	it	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	two	women	.
Women	tend	to	get	 in 	 timacy 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	than	men	do	.
Women	get	 in 	 timacy 	 	from	 face 	 - 	 to 	 - 	 face 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	.
We	swivel	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	each	other	,	we	do	what	we	call	the	``	 anchor 	 ing 	 	 gaz 	 e 	 	''	and	we	talk	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 in 	 timacy 	 	to	women	.
I	think	it	 come 	 s 	 	from	 million 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	of	 hold 	 ing 	 	that	baby	in	front	of	your	face	,	 ca 	 jol 	 ing 	 	it	,	 reprimand 	 ing 	 	it	,	 educ 	 ating 	 	it	with	 word 	 s 	 	.
Men	tend	to	get	 in 	 timacy 	 	from	 side 	 - 	 by 	 - 	 side 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	.
 A 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	one	guy	 look 	 s 	 	up	,	the	other	guy	will	look	away	.
I	think	it	 come 	 s 	 	from	 million 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	of	 stand 	 ing 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	that	--	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	the	bush	,	looking	straight	 a 	 head 	 	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	hit	that	buffalo	on	the	head	with	a	rock	.
I	think	,	for	 million 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	men	 face 	 d 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 ene 	 mies 	 	,	they	 s 	 at 	 	side	by	side	with	 friend 	 s 	 	.
So	my	final	 state 	 ment 	 	is	:	love	is	in	us	.
It	's	 deep 	 ly 	 	 embed 	 d 	 ed 	 	in	the	brain	.
Our	 challeng 	 e 	 	is	to	understand	each	other	.	Thank	you	.

It	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	an	honor	to	be	here	 to 	 night 	 	,	and	I	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	glad	that	I	 stay 	 ed 	 	here	and	 listen 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	I	've	 re 	 ally 	 	 be 	 en 	 	inspired	.
And	I	'm	going	to	play	some	 song 	 s 	 	for	you	 to 	 night 	 	that	are	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	world	 premiere 	 s 	 	.
I	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	my	new	record	and	I	've	never	 play 	 ed 	 	these	 song 	 s 	 	for	 any 	 body 	 	 ex 	 cept 	 	the	 micro 	 phone 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	song	that	I	wrote	about	the	meaning	of	technology	,	which	 go 	 es 	 	 perfect 	 ly 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	 gather 	 ing 	 	.
I	 start 	 ed 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	--	when	I	was	in	college	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	blind	person	,	 do 	 ing 	 	a	research	paper	was	a	major	 under 	 taking 	 	.
You	had	to	go	to	the	library	,	see	if	you	could	get	them	to	find	the	 book 	 s 	 	for	you	,	you	know	,	 foot 	 note 	 s 	 	and	all	that	.
 N 	 ow 	 	you	can	just	go	on	Google	.	Just	look	it	up	.
I	wish	I	had	that	when	I	was	in	college	.
 Any 	 way 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	song	about	:	we	have	all	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	what	are	we	going	to	do	with	it	?
It	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	All	the	 Answer 	 s 	 	.	''
 W 	 hew 	 	!	It	's	a	miracle	I	did	n't	make	any	 mistak 	 es 	 	on	that	song	.
That	's	the	first	time	I	've	ever	 play 	 ed 	 	it	.
It	's	a	``	feel	the	fear	and	do	it	 any 	 way 	 	''	kind	of	thing	.
 Th 	 is 	 	next	song	is	a	song	that	 start 	 ed 	 	out	 a 	 s 	 	a	dream	--	a	 child 	 hood 	 	dream	.
It	was	one	of	the	 title 	 s 	 	that	I	was	sort	of	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 call 	 ing 	 	my	record	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	there	's	a	couple	of	 problem 	 s 	 	.
One	thing	is	,	it	's	 un 	 pronounce 	 able 	 	.
And	it	's	a	 made 	 - 	 up 	 	word	.
It	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 Tem 	 ber 	 er 	 ana 	 	.	''
And	the	song	is	based	on	what	I	think	was	my	first	 child 	 hood 	 	 attempt 	 s 	 	to	think	about	 in 	 visible 	 	 force 	 s 	 	.
So	``	tembererana	''	was	these	 dream 	 s 	 	,	in	which	I	would	be	running	away	from	bad	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	--	is	the	 on 	 ly 	 	way	I	can	put	it	.

Jane	 Po 	 yn 	 ter 	 	:	Life	in	 Bio 	 sphere 	 	2
I	have	had	the	distinct	pleasure	of	living	 in 	 side 	 	two	 bio 	 sphere 	 s 	 	.
Of	course	we	all	here	in	 th 	 is 	 	room	live	in	 Bio 	 sphere 	 	1	.
I	've	 al 	 so 	 	lived	in	 Bio 	 sphere 	 	2	.
And	the	 wonder 	 ful 	 	thing	about	that	is	that	I	get	to	 compar 	 e 	 	 bio 	 sphere 	 s 	 	.
And	 hope 	 fully 	 	from	that	I	get	to	learn	 some 	 thing 	 	.
So	what	did	I	learn	?	Well	,	here	I	am	 in 	 side 	 	 Bio 	 sphere 	 	2	,	making	a	pizza	.
So	I	am	 harvest 	 ing 	 	the	wheat	,	in	order	to	make	the	dough	.
And	then	of	course	I	have	to	milk	the	 goat 	 s 	 	and	feed	the	 goat 	 s 	 	in	order	to	make	the	cheese	.
It	took	me	four	 month 	 s 	 	in	 Bio 	 sphere 	 	2	to	make	a	pizza	.
 He 	 re 	 	in	 Bio 	 sphere 	 	1	,	well	it	 take 	 s 	 	me	about	two	 minute 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	I	pick	up	the	phone	and	I	call	and	say	,	``	Hey	,	can	you	deliver	the	pizza	?	''
So	 Bio 	 sphere 	 	2	was	 essential 	 ly 	 	a	 three 	 - 	 acre 	 	,	 entire 	 ly 	 	 seal 	 ed 	 	,	 miniatur 	 e 	 	world	that	I	lived	in	for	two	 year 	 s 	 	and	20	 minute 	 s 	 	.
Over	the	top	it	was	 seal 	 ed 	 	with	steel	and	glass	,	 under 	 neath 	 	it	was	 seal 	 ed 	 	with	a	pan	of	steel	--	 essential 	 ly 	 	 entire 	 ly 	 	 seal 	 ed 	 	.
So	we	had	our	own	 miniatur 	 e 	 	 rain 	 forest 	 	,	a	private	beach	with	a	coral	reef	.
We	had	a	savanna	,	a	marsh	,	a	desert	.
We	had	our	own	 half 	 - 	 acre 	 	farm	that	we	had	to	grow	 every 	 thing 	 	.
And	of	course	we	had	our	human	 habit 	 at 	 	,	where	we	lived	.
Back	in	the	 mid 	 - 	 ' 	 80 	 s 	 	when	we	 we 	 re 	 	 design 	 ing 	 	 Bio 	 sphere 	 	2	,	we	had	to	ask	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	some	 pre 	 tty 	 	 bas 	 ic 	 	 question 	 s 	 	.
I	mean	,	what	is	a	 bio 	 sphere 	 	?
Back	then	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	I	guess	we	all	know	now	that	it	is	 essential 	 ly 	 	the	sphere	of	life	around	the	Earth	,	right	?
Well	,	you	have	to	get	a	little	more	specific	than	that	if	you	're	going	to	build	one	.
And	so	we	 decide 	 d 	 	that	what	it	 re 	 ally 	 	is	is	that	it	is	 entire 	 ly 	 	 material 	 ly 	 	closed	--	that	is	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	 go 	 es 	 	in	or	out	at	all	,	no	material	--	and	 energ 	 et 	 ically 	 	open	,	which	is	 essential 	 ly 	 	what	planet	Earth	is	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	chamber	that	was	1/400th	the	 s 	 ize 	 	of	 Bio 	 sphere 	 	2	that	we	 call 	 ed 	 	our	 T 	 est 	 	Module	.
And	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	day	that	 th 	 is 	 	fellow	,	John	 All 	 en 	 	,	 walk 	 ed 	 	in	,	to	 s 	 pend 	 	a	couple	of	 day 	 s 	 	in	there	with	all	the	 plant 	 s 	 	and	 animal 	 s 	 	and	bacteria	that	we	'd	put	in	there	to	 hope 	 fully 	 	keep	him	 al 	 ive 	 	,	the	 doctor 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 concern 	 ed 	 	that	he	was	going	to	succumb	to	some	 dread 	 ful 	 	toxin	,	or	that	his	 lung 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	get	 choke 	 d 	 	with	bacteria	or	 some 	 thing 	 	,	fungus	.
But	of	course	 non 	 e 	 	of	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
And	over	the	 en 	 suing 	 	few	 year 	 s 	 	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	great	 s 	 aga 	 s 	 	about	 design 	 ing 	 	 Bio 	 sphere 	 	2	.
But	by	1991	we	 final 	 ly 	 	had	 th 	 is 	 	thing	built	.
And	it	was	time	for	us	to	go	in	and	give	it	a	go	.
We	 need 	 ed 	 	to	know	,	is	life	 th 	 is 	 	 malle 	 able 	 	?
Can	you	take	 th 	 is 	 	 bio 	 sphere 	 	,	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 evolv 	 ed 	 	on	a	planetary	scale	,	and	jam	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	little	bottle	,	and	will	it	 surviv 	 e 	 	?
Big	 question 	 s 	 	.
And	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	know	 th 	 is 	 	both	for	 be 	 ing 	 	able	to	go	 some 	 where 	 	else	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	--	if	we	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	go	to	 Mar 	 s 	 	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	would	we	take	a	 bio 	 sphere 	 	with	us	,	to	live	in	it	?
We	 al 	 so 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	know	so	we	can	understand	more	about	the	Earth	that	we	all	live	in	.
Well	,	in	1991	it	was	 final 	 ly 	 	time	for	us	to	go	in	and	try	out	 th 	 is 	 	baby	.
Let	's	take	it	on	a	maiden	voyage	.
Will	it	work	?	Or	will	 some 	 thing 	 	happen	that	we	ca	n't	understand	and	we	ca	n't	fix	,	 there 	 by 	 	 neg 	 ating 	 	the	 con 	 cept 	 	of	 man 	 - 	 made 	 	 bio 	 sphere 	 s 	 	?
So	eight	of	us	went	in	:	four	men	and	four	women	.
 Mo 	 re 	 	on	that	 lat 	 er 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	world	that	we	lived	in	.
So	,	on	the	top	,	we	had	these	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 rain 	 forest 	 s 	 	and	an	ocean	,	and	 under 	 neath 	 	we	had	all	 th 	 is 	 	 techno 	 sphere 	 	,	we	 call 	 ed 	 	it	,	which	is	where	all	the	 pump 	 s 	 	and	the	 val 	 ves 	 	and	the	water	 tank 	 s 	 	and	the	air	 handler 	 s 	 	,	and	all	of	that	.
One	of	the	 Bio 	 s 	 ph 	 er 	 ians 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	it	``	garden	of	 E 	 den 	 	on	top	of	an	 air 	 craft 	 	 car 	 rier 	 	.	''
And	then	 al 	 so 	 	we	had	the	human	 habit 	 at 	 	of	course	,	with	the	 labor 	 ator 	 ies 	 	,	and	all	of	that	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	 agricultur 	 e 	 	.
It	was	 essential 	 ly 	 	an	 organ 	 ic 	 	farm	.
The	day	I	 walk 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 Bio 	 sphere 	 	2	,	I	was	,	for	the	first	time	,	 breath 	 ing 	 	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	atmosphere	than	 every 	 body 	 	else	in	the	world	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	seven	other	people	.
At	that	moment	I	 be 	 came 	 	part	of	that	 bio 	 sphere 	 	.
And	I	do	n't	mean	that	in	an	abstract	sense	;	I	mean	it	 ra 	 ther 	 	 liter 	 ally 	 	.
When	I	 breath 	 ed 	 	out	,	my	CO2	fed	the	sweet	 potato 	 es 	 	that	I	was	growing	.
And	we	ate	an	awful	lot	of	the	sweet	 potato 	 es 	 	.
And	 t 	 hose 	 	sweet	 potato 	 es 	 	 be 	 came 	 	part	of	me	.
In	fact	,	we	ate	so	 man 	 y 	 	sweet	 potato 	 es 	 	I	 be 	 came 	 	 o 	 range 	 	with	sweet	potato	.
I	 liter 	 ally 	 	was	eating	the	same	carbon	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	.
I	was	eating	 my 	 self 	 	in	some	strange	sort	of	bizarre	way	.
When	it	came	to	our	atmosphere	,	 how 	 ever 	 	,	it	was	n't	that	much	of	a	joke	over	the	long	term	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	oxygen	,	 quit 	 e 	 	a	lot	of	oxygen	.
And	we	 k 	 new 	 	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	CO2	.
And	so	we	 we 	 re 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	to	 sequest 	 er 	 	carbon	.
Good	lord	--	we	know	that	term	now	.
We	 we 	 re 	 	growing	 plant 	 s 	 	like	crazy	.
We	 we 	 re 	 	taking	 the 	 ir 	 	 bio 	 mass 	 	,	storing	them	in	the	 base 	 ment 	 	,	growing	 plant 	 s 	 	,	going	around	,	around	,	around	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	take	all	of	that	carbon	out	of	the	atmosphere	.
We	 we 	 re 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	stop	carbon	from	going	 in 	 to 	 	the	atmosphere	.
We	 stop 	 ped 	 	 irrig 	 ating 	 	our	 s 	 oil 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	we	could	.
We	 stop 	 ped 	 	 till 	 ing 	 	,	so	that	we	could	prevent	 green 	 house 	 	 gas 	 s 	 es 	 	from	going	 in 	 to 	 	the	air	.
But	our	oxygen	was	going	down	 fast 	 er 	 	than	our	CO2	was	going	up	,	which	was	 quit 	 e 	 	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	had	 s 	 een 	 	them	going	in	tandem	in	the	test	 modul 	 e 	 	.
And	it	was	like	 play 	 ing 	 	atomic	 hide 	 - 	 and 	 - 	 seek 	 	.
We	had	lost	seven	 ton 	 s 	 	of	oxygen	.
And	we	had	no	clue	where	it	was	.
And	I	tell	you	,	when	you	lose	a	lot	of	oxygen	--	and	our	oxygen	went	down	 quit 	 e 	 	far	;	it	went	from	21	percent	down	to	14.2	percent	--	my	 good 	 ness 	 	,	do	you	feel	 dread 	 ful 	 	.
I	mean	we	 we 	 re 	 	 drag 	 ging 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	around	the	 Bio 	 sphere 	 	.
And	we	had	sleep	apnea	at	night	.
So	you	'd	wake	up	 gasp 	 ing 	 	with	breath	,	 be 	 cause 	 	your	blood	 chemist 	 ry 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 change 	 d 	 	.
And	that	you	 liter 	 ally 	 	do	that	.	You	stop	 breath 	 ing 	 	and	then	you	--	--	take	a	breath	and	it	 wake 	 s 	 	you	up	.	And	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 irrit 	 ating 	 	.
And	 every 	 body 	 	 out 	 side 	 	thought	we	 we 	 re 	 	 dy 	 ing 	 	.
I	mean	,	the	media	was	making	it	sound	like	 we 	 re 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 dy 	 ing 	 	.
And	I	had	to	call	up	my	mother	every	other	day	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	No	,	Mum	,	it	's	fine	,	fine	.
We	're	not	dead	.	We	're	fine	.	We	're	fine	.	''
And	the	doctor	was	,	in	fact	,	 check 	 ing 	 	us	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	we	 we 	 re 	 	,	in	fact	,	fine	.
But	in	fact	he	was	the	person	who	was	most	susceptible	to	the	oxygen	.
And	one	day	he	could	n't	add	up	a	line	of	 figure 	 s 	 	.
And	it	was	time	for	us	to	put	oxygen	in	.
And	you	might	think	,	well	,	``	Boy	,	your	life	support	system	was	 fail 	 ing 	 	you	.	 Wa 	 s 	 	n't	that	 dread 	 ful 	 	?	''
Yes	.	In	a	sense	it	was	 terrify 	 ing 	 	.
 Ex 	 cept 	 	that	I	 k 	 new 	 	I	could	walk	out	the	 air 	 lock 	 	door	at	any	time	,	if	it	 re 	 ally 	 	got	bad	,	 th 	 ough 	 	who	was	going	to	say	,	``	I	ca	n't	take	it	 any 	 more 	 	!	``	?
Not	me	,	that	was	for	 s 	 ure 	 	.
But	on	the	other	hand	,	it	was	the	scientific	gold	of	the	project	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	could	 re 	 ally 	 	crank	 th 	 is 	 	baby	up	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	scientific	tool	,	and	see	if	we	could	,	in	fact	,	find	where	 t 	 hose 	 	seven	 ton 	 s 	 	of	oxygen	had	gone	.
And	we	did	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	find	it	.
And	we	found	it	in	the	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	.
 Essential 	 ly 	 	it	had	 d 	 one 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	.
We	had	put	too	much	carbon	in	the	 s 	 oil 	 	in	the	form	of	 com 	 post 	 	.
It	broke	down	;	it	took	oxygen	out	of	the	air	;	it	put	CO2	 in 	 to 	 	the	air	;	and	it	went	 in 	 to 	 	the	 con 	 cre 	 te 	 	.
 Pre 	 tty 	 	 straight 	 forward 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	.
So	at	the	end	of	the	two	 year 	 s 	 	when	we	came	out	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	 el 	 ated 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	in	fact	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	you	might	say	we	had	 discover 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	was	 quit 	 e 	 	``	 uh 	 h 	 	,	''	when	your	oxygen	is	going	down	,	 stop 	 ped 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	,	 essential 	 ly 	 	,	in	your	life	support	system	,	that	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	bad	failure	.
 Ex 	 cept 	 	that	we	 k 	 new 	 	what	it	was	.	And	we	 k 	 new 	 	how	to	fix	it	.
And	 noth 	 ing 	 	else	 emerge 	 d 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	was	 a 	 s 	 	serious	 a 	 s 	 	that	.
And	we	 prov 	 ed 	 	the	 con 	 cept 	 	,	more	or	less	.
People	,	on	the	other	hand	,	was	a	different	subject	.
We	 we 	 re 	 	--	 yea 	 h 	 	I	do	n't	know	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	 fix 	 able 	 	.
We	all	went	 quit 	 e 	 	nuts	,	I	will	say	.
And	the	day	I	came	out	of	 Bio 	 sphere 	 	2	,	I	was	 thrill 	 ed 	 	I	was	going	to	see	all	my	family	and	my	 friend 	 s 	 	.
For	two	 year 	 s 	 	I	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	people	through	the	glass	.
And	 every 	 body 	 	ran	up	to	me	.
And	I	 re 	 coil 	 ed 	 	.	 The 	 y 	 	 s 	 tank 	 	!
People	stink	!
We	stink	of	 hair 	 spray 	 	and	 under 	 arm 	 	 deodo 	 rant 	 	,	and	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	stuff	.
 N 	 ow 	 	we	had	stuff	 in 	 side 	 	 Bio 	 sphere 	 	to	keep	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	clean	,	but	 noth 	 ing 	 	with	perfume	.
And	boy	do	we	stink	out	here	.
Not	 on 	 ly 	 	that	,	but	I	lost	touch	of	where	my	food	came	from	.
I	had	 be 	 en 	 	growing	all	my	own	food	.
I	had	no	idea	what	was	in	my	food	,	where	it	came	from	.
I	did	n't	even	 recogn 	 ize 	 	half	the	 name 	 s 	 	in	most	of	the	food	that	I	was	eating	.
In	fact	,	I	would	stand	for	 hour 	 s 	 	in	the	 aisle 	 s 	 	of	 shop 	 s 	 	,	 read 	 ing 	 	all	the	 name 	 s 	 	on	all	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	.
People	must	have	thought	I	was	nuts	.
It	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	 astonish 	 ing 	 	.
And	I	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	lost	track	of	where	I	was	in	 th 	 is 	 	big	 bio 	 sphere 	 	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	big	 bio 	 sphere 	 	that	we	all	live	in	.
In	 Bio 	 sphere 	 	2	I	 total 	 ly 	 	 under 	 stood 	 	that	I	had	a	huge	impact	on	my	 bio 	 sphere 	 	,	 every 	 day 	 	,	and	it	had	an	impact	on	me	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 visceral 	 ly 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 liter 	 ally 	 	.
So	I	went	about	my	business	:	 Parag 	 on 	 	Space	 Develop 	 ment 	 	 Corp 	 or 	 ation 	 	,	a	little	firm	I	 start 	 ed 	 	with	people	while	I	was	in	the	 Bio 	 sphere 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	I	had	 noth 	 ing 	 	else	to	do	.
And	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	we	did	was	try	to	figure	out	:	how	small	can	you	make	these	 bio 	 sphere 	 s 	 	,	and	what	can	you	do	with	them	?
And	so	we	 s 	 ent 	 	one	onto	the	Mir	Space	 St 	 ation 	 	.
We	had	one	on	the	shuttle	and	one	on	the	 Inter 	 national 	 	Space	 St 	 ation 	 	,	for	16	 month 	 s 	 	,	where	we	 manage 	 d 	 	to	produce	the	first	 organism 	 s 	 	to	go	through	complete	 multi 	 ple 	 	life	 cycle 	 s 	 	in	space	--	 re 	 ally 	 	 push 	 ing 	 	the	 envelop 	 e 	 	of	 understand 	 ing 	 	how	 malle 	 able 	 	our	life	 system 	 s 	 	are	.
And	I	'm	 al 	 so 	 	proud	to	announce	that	you	're	 get 	 ting 	 	a	sneak	 pre 	 view 	 	--	on	 Frida 	 y 	 	we	're	going	to	announce	that	we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 form 	 ing 	 	a	team	to	develop	a	system	to	grow	 plant 	 s 	 	on	the	 Mo 	 on 	 	,	which	is	going	to	be	 pre 	 tty 	 	 f 	 un 	 	.
And	the	 leg 	 acy 	 	of	that	is	a	system	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	 design 	 ing 	 	:	an	 entire 	 ly 	 	 seal 	 ed 	 	system	to	grow	 plant 	 s 	 	to	grow	on	 Mar 	 s 	 	.
And	part	of	that	is	that	we	had	to	model	 ver 	 y 	 	rapid	 circul 	 ation 	 	of	CO2	and	oxygen	and	water	through	 th 	 is 	 	plant	system	.
 A 	 s 	 	a	result	of	that	 model 	 ing 	 	I	 end 	 ed 	 	up	in	all	 place 	 s 	 	,	in	Eritrea	,	in	the	Horn	of	 Afri 	 ca 	 	.
Eritrea	,	 form 	 er 	 ly 	 	part	of	Ethiopia	,	is	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 place 	 s 	 	that	is	 astonish 	 ing 	 ly 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 star 	 k 	 	,	and	I	have	no	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	how	people	 e 	 ke 	 	out	a	living	there	.
It	is	so	dry	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	what	I	saw	.
But	 th 	 is 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	what	I	saw	.
I	saw	a	company	that	had	taken	 sea 	 water 	 	and	sand	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	growing	a	kind	of	crop	that	will	grow	on	 pur 	 e 	 	salt	water	 with 	 out 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	treat	it	.
And	it	will	produce	a	food	crop	.
In	 th 	 is 	 	case	it	was	 oil 	 seed 	 	.
It	was	 astonish 	 ing 	 	.	 The 	 y 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 al 	 so 	 	producing	 man 	 grove 	 s 	 	in	a	 plant 	 ation 	 	.
And	the	 man 	 grove 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	wood	and	honey	and	 leav 	 es 	 	for	the	 animal 	 s 	 	,	so	that	they	could	produce	milk	and	 what 	 not 	 	,	like	we	had	in	the	 Bio 	 sphere 	 	.
And	all	of	it	was	coming	from	 th 	 is 	 	:	shrimp	 farm 	 s 	 	.
 Shri 	 mp 	 	 farm 	 s 	 	are	a	 scour 	 ge 	 	on	the	earth	,	 frank 	 ly 	 	,	from	an	 environment 	 al 	 	point	of	view	.
 The 	 y 	 	pour	huge	 amount 	 s 	 	of	 pollutant 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	ocean	.
 The 	 y 	 	 al 	 so 	 	pollute	 the 	 ir 	 	 next 	 - 	 door 	 	 neighbor 	 s 	 	.
So	they	're	all	 s 	 hitting 	 	each	other	's	 pond 	 s 	 	,	 quit 	 e 	 	 liter 	 ally 	 	.
And	what	 th 	 is 	 	project	was	 do 	 ing 	 	was	taking	the	 ef 	 fluent 	 	of	these	,	and	 turn 	 ing 	 	them	 in 	 to 	 	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	food	.
 The 	 y 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 liter 	 ally 	 	 turn 	 ing 	 	 poll 	 ution 	 	 in 	 to 	 	abundance	for	a	desert	people	.
 The 	 y 	 	had	 create 	 d 	 	an	industrial	 eco 	 system 	 	,	of	a	sense	.
I	was	there	 be 	 cause 	 	I	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 model 	 ing 	 	the	 man 	 grove 	 	 port 	 ion 	 	for	a	carbon	credit	program	,	under	the	 U. 	 N 	 	.
Kyoto	 Pro 	 to 	 col 	 	system	.
And	 a 	 s 	 	I	was	 model 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 man 	 grove 	 	swamp	,	I	was	 think 	 ing 	 	to	 my 	 self 	 	,	``	How	do	you	put	a	box	around	 th 	 is 	 	?	''
When	I	'm	 model 	 ing 	 	a	plant	in	a	box	,	 liter 	 ally 	 	,	I	know	where	to	draw	the	 bound 	 ary 	 	.
In	a	 man 	 grove 	 	forest	like	 th 	 is 	 	I	have	no	idea	.
Well	,	of	course	you	have	to	draw	the	 bound 	 ary 	 	around	the	whole	of	the	Earth	.
And	understand	 it 	 s 	 	 interact 	 ions 	 	with	the	entire	Earth	.
And	put	your	project	in	that	 con 	 text 	 	.
 A 	 round 	 	the	world	 to 	 day 	 	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	an	 in 	 credible 	 	 transform 	 ation 	 	,	from	what	I	would	call	a	 bio 	 cidal 	 	species	,	one	that	--	 whet 	 her 	 	we	 intentional 	 ly 	 	or	 un 	 intentional 	 ly 	 	--	have	designed	our	 system 	 s 	 	to	kill	life	,	a	lot	of	the	time	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	in	fact	,	 th 	 is 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	photograph	,	is	in	fact	over	the	Amazon	.
And	here	the	light	green	are	 area 	 s 	 	of	massive	 de 	 forest 	 ation 	 	.
And	 t 	 hose 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 wis 	 py 	 	 cloud 	 s 	 	are	,	in	fact	,	 fire 	 s 	 	,	 human 	 - 	 made 	 	 fire 	 s 	 	.
We	're	in	the	process	of	 transform 	 ing 	 	from	 th 	 is 	 	,	to	what	I	would	call	a	 bio 	 philic 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	one	where	we	learn	to	nurture	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	it	may	not	seem	like	it	,	but	we	are	.
It	is	 happen 	 ing 	 	all	 a 	 cross 	 	the	world	,	in	every	kind	of	walk	of	life	,	and	every	kind	of	 care 	 er 	 	and	industry	that	you	can	think	of	.
And	I	think	often	 time 	 s 	 	people	get	lost	in	that	.
 The 	 y 	 	go	,	``	But	how	can	I	possibly	find	my	way	in	that	?
It	's	 s 	 uch 	 	a	huge	subject	.	''
And	I	would	say	that	the	small	stuff	 count 	 s 	 	.	It	 re 	 ally 	 	 do 	 es 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	story	of	a	rake	in	my	 back 	 yard 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	was	my	 back 	 yard 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	early	on	,	when	I	 b 	 ought 	 	my	 proper 	 ty 	 	.
And	in	Arizona	,	of	course	,	 every 	 body 	 	 put 	 s 	 	 grave 	 l 	 	down	.
And	they	like	to	keep	 every 	 thing 	 	 beaut 	 i 	 fully 	 	 rak 	 ed 	 	.	And	they	keep	all	the	 leav 	 es 	 	away	.
And	on	 Sun 	 day 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	the	 neighbor 	 s 	 	leaf	 blow 	 er 	 	 come 	 s 	 	out	,	and	I	want	to	throttle	them	.
It	's	a	certain	type	of	aesthetic	.
We	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 comfort 	 able 	 	with	 un 	 tidi 	 ness 	 	.
And	I	threw	away	my	rake	.
And	I	let	all	of	the	 leav 	 es 	 	fall	from	the	 tree 	 s 	 	that	I	have	on	my	 proper 	 ty 	 	.
And	over	time	,	 essential 	 ly 	 	what	have	I	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	?
I	've	 be 	 en 	 	building	 top 	 s 	 oil 	 	.
And	so	now	all	the	 bird 	 s 	 	come	in	.	And	I	have	 hawk 	 s 	 	.
And	I	have	an	 oa 	 sis 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	what	 happen 	 s 	 	every	spring	.	For	six	 week 	 s 	 	,	six	to	eight	 week 	 s 	 	,	I	have	 th 	 is 	 	flush	of	green	 oa 	 sis 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	in	a	 rip 	 arian 	 	area	.
And	all	of	 Tu 	 c 	 son 	 	could	be	like	 th 	 is 	 	if	 every 	 body 	 	would	just	revolt	and	throw	away	the	rake	.
The	small	stuff	 count 	 s 	 	.
The	 Indus 	 trial 	 	 R 	 evolution 	 	--	and	 Pro 	 me 	 the 	 us 	 	--	 ha 	 s 	 	 give 	 n 	 	us	 th 	 is 	 	,	the	ability	to	light	up	the	world	.
It	 ha 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 give 	 n 	 	us	 th 	 is 	 	,	the	ability	to	look	at	the	world	from	the	 out 	 side 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	we	may	not	all	have	 an 	 other 	 	 bio 	 sphere 	 	that	we	can	run	to	,	and	 compar 	 e 	 	it	to	 th 	 is 	 	 bio 	 sphere 	 	.
But	we	can	look	at	the	world	,	and	try	to	understand	where	we	are	in	 it 	 s 	 	 con 	 text 	 	,	and	how	we	 choos 	 e 	 	to	interact	with	it	.
And	if	you	lose	where	you	are	in	your	 bio 	 sphere 	 	,	or	are	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	 difficult 	 y 	 	 connect 	 ing 	 	with	where	you	are	in	the	 bio 	 sphere 	 	,	I	would	say	to	you	,	take	a	deep	breath	.
The	 yogi 	 s 	 	had	it	right	.
 Brea 	 th 	 	 do 	 es 	 	,	in	fact	,	connect	us	all	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 liter 	 al 	 	way	.
Take	a	breath	now	.
And	 a 	 s 	 	you	breathe	,	think	about	what	is	in	your	breath	.
There	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	is	the	CO2	from	the	person	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	 next 	 - 	 door 	 	to	you	.
 May 	 be 	 	there	is	a	little	bit	of	oxygen	from	some	 al 	 ga 	 e 	 	on	the	beach	not	far	from	here	.
It	 al 	 so 	 	 connect 	 s 	 	us	in	time	.
There	may	be	some	carbon	in	your	breath	from	the	 dinosaur 	 s 	 	.
There	could	 al 	 so 	 	be	carbon	that	you	are	 exhal 	 ing 	 	now	that	will	be	in	the	breath	of	your	 great 	 - 	 great 	 - 	 great 	 - 	 grand 	 children 	 	.
Thank	you	.

 N 	 ow 	 	,	 chance 	 s 	 	are	that	over	the	last	winter	,	if	you	had	 be 	 en 	 	a	 bee 	 hive 	 	,	either	you	or	one	of	the	two	people	you	just	 nod 	 d 	 ed 	 	at	would	have	 di 	 ed 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	that	's	an	awful	lot	of	bees	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	second	year	in	a	row	we	have	lost	over	30	percent	of	the	 colon 	 ies 	 	,	or	we	estimate	we	've	lost	30	percent	of	the	 colon 	 ies 	 	over	the	winter	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	that	's	a	lot	,	a	lot	of	bees	,	and	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
And	most	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 loss 	 es 	 	are	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	we	know	.
We	know	that	there	are	these	varroa	 mite 	 s 	 	that	have	 introduc 	 ed 	 	and	 caus 	 ed 	 	a	lot	of	 loss 	 es 	 	,	and	we	 al 	 so 	 	have	 th 	 is 	 	new	 phenomen 	 on 	 	,	which	I	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	last	year	,	 Col 	 ony 	 	 Col 	 lapse 	 	 Dis 	 order 	 	.
And	here	we	see	a	picture	on	top	of	a	hill	in	 Cent 	 ral 	 	 Valle 	 y 	 	last	 De 	 c 	 emb 	 er 	 	.
And	 be 	 low 	 	,	you	can	see	all	these	out	 yard 	 s 	 	,	or	 tempor 	 ary 	 	 yard 	 s 	 	,	where	the	 colon 	 ies 	 	are	 br 	 ought 	 	in	 un 	 til 	 	 Fe 	 br 	 uary 	 	,	and	then	they	're	 ship 	 ped 	 	out	to	the	 al 	 mond 	 s 	 	.
And	one	 document 	 ary 	 	writer	,	who	was	here	and	 look 	 ed 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	two	 month 	 s 	 	after	I	was	here	,	 de 	 scribed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	not	 a 	 s 	 	 bee 	 hive 	 s 	 	but	 a 	 s 	 	a	 grave 	 yard 	 	,	with	these	empty	white	boxes	with	no	bees	left	in	them	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	I	'm	going	to	sum	up	a	year	's	worth	of	work	in	two	 sentence 	 s 	 	to	say	that	we	have	 be 	 en 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	out	what	the	cause	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	.
And	what	we	know	is	that	it	's	 a 	 s 	 	if	the	bees	have	caught	a	flu	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	flu	 ha 	 s 	 	 wipe 	 d 	 	through	the	population	of	bees	.
In	some	 case 	 s 	 	,	and	in	fact	in	most	 case 	 s 	 	in	one	year	,	 th 	 is 	 	flu	was	 caus 	 ed 	 	by	a	new	virus	to	us	,	or	 new 	 ly 	 	identified	by	us	,	 call 	 ed 	 	Israeli	 A 	 cute 	 	 Para 	 lysis 	 	virus	.
It	was	 call 	 ed 	 	that	 be 	 cause 	 	a	guy	in	Israel	first	found	it	,	and	he	now	 regret 	 s 	 	 pro 	 found 	 ly 	 	 call 	 ing 	 	it	that	disease	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	of	course	,	there	's	the	 implic 	 ation 	 	.
But	we	think	 th 	 is 	 	virus	is	 pre 	 tty 	 	 ubiqu 	 it 	 ous 	 	.
It	's	 al 	 so 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	clear	that	the	bees	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	catch	other	viruses	or	other	 flu 	 s 	 	,	and	so	the	question	we	're	still	 st 	 rug 	 gling 	 	with	,	and	the	question	that	 keep 	 s 	 	us	up	at	night	,	is	why	have	the	bees	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 be 	 come 	 	so	susceptible	to	 th 	 is 	 	flu	,	and	why	are	they	so	susceptible	to	these	other	 disease 	 s 	 	?
And	we	do	n't	have	the	answer	to	that	yet	,	and	we	 s 	 pend 	 	a	lot	of	time	 try 	 ing 	 	to	figure	that	out	.
We	think	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	it	's	a	combination	of	 factor 	 s 	 	.
We	know	from	the	work	of	a	 ver 	 y 	 	large	and	dynamic	 work 	 ing 	 	team	that	,	you	know	,	we	're	 find 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	different	 pest 	 icide 	 s 	 	in	the	hive	,	and	 surprising 	 ly 	 	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	the	 health 	 iest 	 	 hive 	 s 	 	have	the	most	 pest 	 icide 	 s 	 	.	And	so	we	discover	all	these	 ver 	 y 	 	strange	 thing 	 s 	 	that	we	ca	n't	begin	to	understand	.
And	so	 th 	 is 	 	 open 	 s 	 	up	the	whole	idea	of	looking	at	 colon 	 y 	 	health	.
 N 	 ow 	 	of	course	,	if	you	lose	a	lot	of	 colon 	 ies 	 	,	 beekee 	 per 	 s 	 	can	replace	them	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
And	that	's	why	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	 re 	 cover 	 	from	a	lot	of	loss	.
If	we	lost	one	in	every	three	 cow 	 s 	 	in	the	winter	,	you	know	,	the	National	Guard	would	be	out	.
But	what	 beekee 	 per 	 s 	 	can	do	is	,	if	they	have	one	 surviv 	 ing 	 	 colon 	 y 	 	,	they	can	split	that	 colon 	 y 	 	in	two	.
And	then	the	one	half	that	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	a	 que 	 en 	 	,	they	can	buy	a	 que 	 en 	 	.
It	 come 	 s 	 	in	the	mail	;	it	can	come	from	Australia	or	 Hawa 	 ii 	 	or	 Flor 	 ida 	 	,	and	you	can	 introduc 	 e 	 	that	 que 	 en 	 	.
And	in	fact	,	America	was	the	first	country	that	ever	did	 mail 	 - 	 deliver 	 y 	 	 que 	 en 	 s 	 	and	in	fact	,	it	's	part	of	the	 post 	 al 	 	code	that	you	have	to	deliver	 que 	 en 	 s 	 	by	mail	in	order	to	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	we	have	 en 	 ough 	 	bees	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	.
If	you	do	n't	just	want	a	 que 	 en 	 	,	you	can	buy	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	a	 three 	 - 	 pound 	 	package	of	bees	,	which	 come 	 s 	 	in	the	mail	,	and	of	course	,	the	 Post 	 al 	 	Office	is	 al 	 ways 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 concern 	 ed 	 	when	they	get	,	you	know	,	your	 three 	 - 	 pound 	 	 package 	 s 	 	of	bees	.
And	you	can	install	 th 	 is 	 	in	your	hive	and	replace	that	 dead 	 - 	 out 	 	.
So	it	 mean 	 s 	 	that	 beekee 	 per 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	good	at	 re 	 placing 	 	 dead 	 - 	 out 	 s 	 	,	and	so	they	've	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	cover	 t 	 hose 	 	 loss 	 es 	 	.
So	even	 th 	 ough 	 	we	've	lost	30	percent	of	the	 colon 	 ies 	 	every	year	,	the	same	number	of	 colon 	 ies 	 	have	 exist 	 ed 	 	in	the	country	,	at	about	2.4	million	 colon 	 ies 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 loss 	 es 	 	are	tragic	on	 man 	 y 	 	 front 	 s 	 	,	and	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 front 	 s 	 	is	for	the	 beekee 	 per 	 	.
And	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	talk	about	 beekee 	 per 	 s 	 	first	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 beekee 	 per 	 s 	 	are	among	the	most	 fasci 	 nating 	 	people	you	'll	ever	meet	.
If	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	group	of	 beekee 	 per 	 s 	 	,	you	would	have	 every 	 one 	 	from	the	 card 	 - 	 carry 	 ing 	 	 N 	 RA 	 	member	who	's	,	you	know	,	live	free	or	die	,	to	the	,	you	know	,	the	 self 	 - 	 express 	 ed 	 	 quirk 	 y 	 	San	 Francis 	 co 	 	 back 	 yard 	 	pig	 farm 	 er 	 	.
And	you	get	all	of	these	people	in	the	same	room	,	and	they	're	all	 engag 	 ed 	 	and	they	're	 get 	 ting 	 	 a 	 long 	 	,	and	they	're	all	there	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 pass 	 ion 	 	for	bees	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	part	of	that	community	which	are	the	commercial	 beekee 	 per 	 s 	 	,	the	 one 	 s 	 	who	make	 the 	 ir 	 	livelihood	from	 beekee 	 ping 	 	 al 	 one 	 	.
And	these	tend	to	be	some	of	the	most	 in 	 dependent 	 	,	 ten 	 acious 	 	,	intuitive	,	you	know	,	 invent 	 ive 	 	people	you	will	ever	meet	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	just	 fasci 	 nating 	 	.	And	they	're	like	that	all	over	the	world	.
I	had	the	privilege	of	 work 	 ing 	 	in	Haiti	just	for	two	 week 	 s 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	 th 	 is 	 	year	.
And	Haiti	,	if	you	've	ever	 be 	 en 	 	there	,	is	just	a	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	.
I	mean	,	there	may	be	100	 explan 	 ations 	 	for	why	Haiti	is	the	 imp 	 over 	 ish 	 ed 	 	nation	it	is	,	but	there	is	no	excuse	to	see	that	sort	of	squalor	.
But	you	meet	 th 	 is 	 	 beekee 	 per 	 	,	and	I	met	 th 	 is 	 	 beekee 	 per 	 	here	,	and	he	is	one	of	the	most	 knowledge 	 able 	 	 beekee 	 per 	 s 	 	I	've	ever	met	.
No	 form 	 al 	 	education	,	but	 ver 	 y 	 	 knowledge 	 able 	 	.
We	 need 	 ed 	 	 bees 	 wax 	 	for	a	project	we	 we 	 re 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	;	he	was	so	 cap 	 able 	 	,	he	was	able	to	render	the	 nic 	 est 	 	block	of	 bees 	 wax 	 	I	have	ever	 s 	 een 	 	from	cow	dung	,	tin	 can 	 s 	 	and	his	veil	,	which	he	used	 a 	 s 	 	a	 screen 	 ing 	 	,	right	in	 th 	 is 	 	meadow	.	And	so	that	 ing 	 en 	 u 	 ity 	 	is	inspiring	.
We	 al 	 so 	 	have	Dave	 Hac 	 ken 	 berg 	 	,	who	is	the	 post 	 er 	 	child	of	 C 	 CD 	 	.
He	's	the	one	who	first	identified	 th 	 is 	 	condition	and	raised	the	alarm	 bell 	 s 	 	.
And	he	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	these	 truck 	 s 	 	,	and	he	's	 move 	 d 	 	these	bees	up	and	down	the	coast	.
And	a	lot	of	people	talk	about	 truck 	 s 	 	and	moving	bees	,	and	that	 be 	 ing 	 	bad	,	but	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	that	for	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
The	ancient	 Egyptian 	 s 	 	used	to	move	bees	up	and	down	the	 N 	 ile 	 	on	 raft 	 s 	 	,	so	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	a	movable	bee	force	is	not	new	at	all	.
And	one	of	our	real	 worri 	 es 	 	with	 Col 	 ony 	 	 Col 	 lapse 	 	 Dis 	 order 	 	is	the	fact	that	it	 cost 	 s 	 	so	much	money	to	replace	 t 	 hose 	 	 dead 	 - 	 out 	 	 colon 	 ies 	 	.
And	you	can	do	that	one	year	in	a	row	,	you	may	be	able	to	do	it	two	 year 	 s 	 	in	a	row	.
But	if	you	're	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	50	percent	to	80	percent	of	your	 colon 	 ies 	 	,	you	ca	n't	 surviv 	 e 	 	three	 year 	 s 	 	in	a	row	.	And	we	're	 re 	 ally 	 	 worri 	 ed 	 	about	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	segment	of	our	industry	.
And	that	's	 import 	 ant 	 	for	 man 	 y 	 	 front 	 s 	 	,	and	one	of	them	is	 be 	 cause 	 	of	that	culture	that	's	in	 agricultur 	 e 	 	.
And	these	 migr 	 atory 	 	 beekee 	 per 	 s 	 	are	the	last	 nomad 	 s 	 	of	America	.
You	know	,	they	pick	up	 the 	 ir 	 	 hive 	 s 	 	;	they	move	 the 	 ir 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	once	or	twice	in	a	year	.
And	if	you	look	at	 Flor 	 ida 	 	,	in	 Da 	 de 	 	City	,	 Flor 	 ida 	 	,	that	's	where	all	the	 Penn 	 sylvania 	 	 beekee 	 per 	 s 	 	go	.
And	then	20	 mile 	 s 	 	down	the	road	is	 Grove 	 land 	 	,	and	that	's	where	all	the	Wisconsin	 beekee 	 per 	 s 	 	go	.
And	if	you	're	ever	in	 Cent 	 ral 	 	 Valle 	 y 	 	in	 Fe 	 br 	 uary 	 	,	you	go	to	 th 	 is 	 	café	at	10	 o 	 ' 	 clock 	 	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	 Ka 	 thy 	 	and	 K 	 ate 	 	's	.
And	that	's	where	all	the	 beekee 	 per 	 s 	 	come	after	a	night	of	moving	bees	 in 	 to 	 	the	 al 	 mond 	 	 grove 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	all	have	 the 	 ir 	 	 break 	 fast 	 	and	complain	about	 every 	 one 	 	right	there	.	And	it	's	a	great	experience	,	and	I	 re 	 ally 	 	 encourag 	 e 	 	you	to	drop	in	at	that	 din 	 er 	 	 dur 	 ing 	 	that	time	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	 quit 	 e 	 	essential	American	experience	.
And	we	see	these	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	,	these	 nomad 	 ic 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	,	you	know	,	father	to	son	,	father	to	son	,	and	these	 guy 	 s 	 	are	 hurt 	 ing 	 	.
And	they	're	not	people	who	like	to	ask	for	help	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	they	are	the	most	 help 	 ful 	 	people	ever	.
If	there	's	one	guy	who	 lose 	 s 	 	all	his	bees	 be 	 cause 	 	of	a	truck	 over 	 haul 	 	,	 every 	 one 	 	 pitch 	 es 	 	in	and	 give 	 s 	 	20	 hive 	 s 	 	to	help	him	replace	 t 	 hose 	 	lost	 colon 	 ies 	 	.
And	so	,	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	dynamic	,	and	I	think	,	historic	and	 excit 	 ing 	 	community	to	be	 involve 	 d 	 	with	.
Of	course	,	the	real	 import 	 ance 	 	for	bees	is	not	the	honey	.
And	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	I	 high 	 ly 	 	 encourag 	 e 	 	you	,	all	use	honey	.
I	mean	,	it	's	the	most	 ethic 	 al 	 	 sweet 	 en 	 er 	 	,	and	you	know	,	it	's	a	dynamic	and	 f 	 un 	 	 sweet 	 en 	 er 	 	.
But	we	estimate	that	about	one	in	three	 bite 	 s 	 	of	food	we	eat	is	 direct 	 ly 	 	or	 in 	 direct 	 ly 	 	 pollinat 	 ed 	 	by	 honey 	 bees 	 	.
So	if	we	did	not	have	bees	,	it	's	not	like	we	would	 starv 	 e 	 	,	but	 clear 	 ly 	 	our	diet	would	be	 diminish 	 ed 	 	.
It	's	 s 	 aid 	 	that	for	bees	,	the	flower	is	the	fountain	of	life	,	and	for	 flower 	 s 	 	bees	are	the	 messenger 	 s 	 	of	love	.
And	that	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	great	 express 	 ion 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	,	bees	are	the	 s 	 ex 	 	 work 	 ers 	 	for	 flower 	 s 	 	.	 The 	 y 	 	are	,	you	know	--	they	get	paid	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 service 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	get	paid	by	 poll 	 en 	 	and	nectar	,	to	move	that	male	 s 	 perm 	 	,	the	 poll 	 en 	 	,	from	flower	to	flower	.
And	there	are	 flower 	 s 	 	that	are	 self 	 - 	 infer 	 tile 	 	.	That	 mean 	 s 	 	they	ca	n't	--	the	 poll 	 en 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	bloom	ca	n't	 fertil 	 ize 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
So	in	an	apple	 orc 	 hard 	 	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	you	'll	have	 row 	 s 	 	of	10	 apple 	 s 	 	of	one	 varie 	 ty 	 	,	and	then	you	have	 an 	 other 	 	apple	tree	that	's	a	different	type	of	 poll 	 en 	 	.
And	bees	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 faith 	 ful 	 	.
When	they	're	out	 pollinat 	 ing 	 	or	 gather 	 ing 	 	 poll 	 en 	 	from	one	flower	,	they	stay	to	that	crop	 exclusive 	 ly 	 	,	in	order	to	help	generate	.
And	of	course	,	they	're	made	to	carry	 th 	 is 	 	 poll 	 en 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	build	up	a	static	electric	charge	and	the	 poll 	 en 	 	 jump 	 s 	 	on	them	and	 help 	 s 	 	spread	that	 poll 	 en 	 	from	bloom	to	bloom	.
 How 	 ever 	 	,	 honey 	 bees 	 	are	a	 minor 	 ity 	 	.
 Ho 	 ney 	 bees 	 	are	not	native	to	America	;	they	 we 	 re 	 	 introduc 	 ed 	 	with	the	 colonial 	 ists 	 	.
And	there	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	more	species	of	bees	than	there	are	 mammal 	 s 	 	and	 bird 	 s 	 	 combine 	 d 	 	.
In	 Penn 	 sylvania 	 	 al 	 one 	 	,	we	have	 be 	 en 	 	 survey 	 ing 	 	bees	for	150	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 intens 	 e 	 ly 	 	in	the	last	three	 year 	 s 	 	.
We	have	identified	over	400	species	of	bees	in	 Penn 	 sylvania 	 	.
 Thirty 	 - 	 two 	 	species	have	not	 be 	 en 	 	identified	or	found	in	the	state	since	1950	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	that	could	be	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	n't	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 ampl 	 ing 	 	right	,	but	it	 do 	 es 	 	,	I	think	,	suggest	that	 some 	 thing 	 	's	wrong	with	the	 pollinat 	 or 	 	force	.	And	these	bees	are	 fasci 	 nating 	 	.
We	have	 bumble 	 bees 	 	on	the	top	.
And	 bumble 	 bees 	 	are	what	we	call	 eu 	 social 	 	:	they	're	not	 tru 	 ly 	 	social	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	the	 que 	 en 	 	is	,	over	winter	.
We	 al 	 so 	 	have	the	sweat	bees	,	and	these	are	little	 gem 	 s 	 	 fly 	 ing 	 	around	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	like	 tin 	 y 	 	little	flies	and	they	fly	around	.
And	then	you	have	 an 	 other 	 	type	of	bee	,	which	we	call	 klepto 	 parasit 	 es 	 	,	which	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 f 	 ancy 	 	way	of	 say 	 ing 	 	,	 bad 	 - 	 minded 	 	,	 murder 	 ing 	 	--	what	's	the	word	I	'm	looking	for	?	 Mur 	 der 	 ing 	 	--	 Audi 	 ence 	 	:	Bee	?
Dennis	 van 	 Eng 	 elsdorp 	 	:	Bee	.	 Oka 	 y 	 	,	 thank 	 s 	 	.
What	these	bees	do	is	,	they	 s 	 it 	 	there	.	 Th 	 ese 	 	 so 	 lit 	 ary 	 	bees	,	they	drill	a	hole	in	the	ground	or	drill	a	hole	in	a	branch	,	and	they	collect	 poll 	 en 	 	and	make	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	ball	,	and	they	lay	an	egg	on	it	.
Well	,	these	bees	hang	out	at	that	hole	,	and	they	wait	for	that	mother	to	fly	away	,	they	go	in	,	eat	the	egg	,	and	lay	 the 	 ir 	 	own	egg	there	.	So	they	do	n't	do	any	work	.
And	so	,	in	fact	,	if	you	know	you	have	these	 klepto 	 parasit 	 ic 	 	bees	,	you	know	that	your	environment	is	 health 	 y 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	 top 	 - 	 of 	 - 	 the 	 - 	 food 	 - 	 chain 	 	bees	.
And	in	fact	,	there	is	now	a	red	list	of	 pollinat 	 ors 	 	that	we	're	 worri 	 ed 	 	have	 disappear 	 ed 	 	,	and	on	top	of	that	list	are	a	lot	of	these	 klepto 	 parasit 	 es 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	these	 bumble 	 bees 	 	.
And	in	fact	,	if	you	 guy 	 s 	 	live	on	the	West	Coast	,	go	to	these	 web 	 s 	 ites 	 	here	,	and	they	're	 re 	 ally 	 	looking	for	people	to	look	for	some	of	these	 bumble 	 bees 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	think	some	have	gone	extinct	.	Or	some	,	the	population	 ha 	 s 	 	 decline 	 d 	 	.
And	so	it	's	not	just	 honey 	 bees 	 	that	are	in	trouble	,	but	we	do	n't	understand	these	native	 pollinat 	 ors 	 	or	all	 t 	 hose 	 	other	 part 	 s 	 	of	our	community	.
And	of	course	,	bees	are	not	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	factor	here	.
There	are	other	 animal 	 s 	 	that	 pollinat 	 e 	 	,	like	 bat 	 s 	 	,	and	 bat 	 s 	 	are	in	trouble	too	.
And	I	'm	glad	I	'm	a	bee	man	and	not	a	bat	man	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	no	money	to	research	the	bat	 problem 	 s 	 	.
And	 bat 	 s 	 	are	 dy 	 ing 	 	at	an	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	rate	.
 White 	 - 	 nose 	 	syndrome	 ha 	 s 	 	 wipe 	 d 	 	out	 population 	 s 	 	of	 bat 	 s 	 	.
If	there	's	a	cave	in	New	York	that	had	15,000	 bat 	 s 	 	in	it	,	and	there	are	1,000	left	.	That	's	like	San	 Francis 	 co 	 	 be 	 coming 	 	the	population	of	half	of	 th 	 is 	 	 count 	 y 	 	in	three	 year 	 s 	 	.
And	so	that	's	 in 	 credible 	 	.	And	there	's	no	money	to	do	that	.
But	I	'm	glad	to	say	that	I	think	we	know	the	cause	of	all	these	 condition 	 s 	 	,	and	that	cause	is	 N 	 DD 	 	:	Nature	 Defi 	 cit 	 	 Dis 	 order 	 	.
And	that	is	that	I	think	that	what	we	have	in	our	 socie 	 ty 	 	is	,	we	 for 	 got 	 	our	 connect 	 ion 	 	with	nature	.
And	I	think	if	we	 re 	 connect 	 	to	nature	,	we	'll	be	able	to	have	the	 resource 	 s 	 	and	that	interest	to	solve	these	 problem 	 s 	 	.
And	I	think	that	there	is	an	easy	cure	for	 N 	 DD 	 	.
And	that	is	,	make	 meadow 	 s 	 	and	not	 lawn 	 s 	 	.
And	I	think	we	have	lost	our	 connect 	 ion 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	way	of	 re 	 connect 	 ing 	 	to	our	environment	.
I	've	had	the	privilege	of	living	by	a	meadow	for	the	last	little	while	,	and	it	is	 terr 	 ibly 	 	 engag 	 ing 	 	.
And	if	we	look	at	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 lawn 	 s 	 	,	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	tragic	.
It	used	to	be	,	two	,	three	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	that	a	lawn	was	a	symbol	of	 pre 	 stig 	 e 	 	,	and	so	it	was	 on 	 ly 	 	the	 ver 	 y 	 	rich	that	could	keep	these	green	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 desert 	 s 	 	:	they	're	 total 	 ly 	 	 steril 	 e 	 	.
 American 	 s 	 	 s 	 pent 	 	,	in	2001	--	11	percent	of	all	 pest 	 icide 	 	use	was	 d 	 one 	 	on	 lawn 	 s 	 	.
Five	percent	of	our	 green 	 house 	 	 gas 	 es 	 	are	 produce 	 d 	 	by	 mow 	 ing 	 	our	 lawn 	 s 	 	.
And	so	it	's	 in 	 credible 	 	the	amount	of	 resource 	 s 	 	we	've	 s 	 pent 	 	 keep 	 ing 	 	our	 lawn 	 s 	 	,	which	are	these	 use 	 less 	 	 bio 	 system 	 s 	 	.
And	so	we	need	to	 re 	 think 	 	 th 	 is 	 	idea	.
In	fact	,	you	know	,	the	White	House	used	to	have	sheep	in	front	in	order	to	help	fund	the	war	effort	in	World	War	I	,	which	 prob 	 ably 	 	is	not	a	bad	idea	;	it	would	n't	be	a	bad	idea	.
I	want	to	say	 th 	 is 	 	not	 be 	 cause 	 	I	'm	 oppos 	 ed 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	to	 mow 	 ing 	 	 lawn 	 s 	 	.
I	think	that	there	is	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	some	advantage	to	 keep 	 ing 	 	 lawn 	 s 	 	at	a	 limit 	 ed 	 	scale	,	and	I	think	we	're	 encourag 	 ed 	 	to	do	that	.
But	I	 al 	 so 	 	want	to	reinforce	some	of	the	 idea 	 s 	 	we	've	heard	here	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	meadow	or	living	by	a	meadow	is	 transform 	 ation 	 al 	 	.
That	it	is	 amaz 	 ing 	 	that	 connect 	 ion 	 	we	can	have	with	what	's	there	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	 milk 	 weed 	 	 plant 	 s 	 	have	grown	up	in	my	meadow	over	the	last	four	 year 	 s 	 	.	Add	to	watch	the	different	 plant 	 s 	 	,	or	 insect 	 s 	 	,	that	come	to	these	 flower 	 s 	 	,	to	watch	that	--	and	we	've	heard	about	,	you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	relationship	you	can	have	with	wine	,	 th 	 is 	 	companion	you	can	have	 a 	 s 	 	it	 mature 	 s 	 	and	 a 	 s 	 	it	 ha 	 s 	 	these	different	 fragr 	 ance 	 s 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	companion	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	relationship	that	never	 d 	 ries 	 	up	.
You	never	run	out	of	that	companion	 a 	 s 	 	you	drink	 th 	 is 	 	wine	,	too	.
And	I	 encourag 	 e 	 	you	to	look	at	that	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	not	all	of	us	have	 meadow 	 s 	 	,	or	 lawn 	 s 	 	that	we	can	convert	,	and	so	you	can	 al 	 ways 	 	,	of	course	,	grow	a	meadow	in	a	pot	.
 Bee 	 s 	 	 ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	,	can	be	the	 gate 	 way 	 	to	,	you	know	,	other	 thing 	 s 	 	.
So	I	'm	not	 say 	 ing 	 	that	you	should	plant	a	meadow	of	pot	,	but	a	pot	in	a	meadow	.
But	you	can	 al 	 so 	 	have	 th 	 is 	 	great	community	of	city	or	 building 	 - 	 top 	 	 beekee 	 per 	 s 	 	,	these	 beekee 	 per 	 s 	 	that	live	--	 Th 	 is 	 	is	in	Paris	where	these	 beekee 	 per 	 s 	 	live	.
And	 every 	 one 	 	should	open	a	 bee 	 hive 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	the	most	 amaz 	 ing 	 	,	 in 	 credible 	 	thing	.
And	if	we	want	to	cure	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	of	 N 	 DD 	 	,	or	Nature	 Defi 	 cit 	 	 Dis 	 order 	 	,	I	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	great	way	of	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
Get	a	 bee 	 hive 	 	and	grow	a	meadow	,	and	watch	that	life	come	back	 in 	 to 	 	your	life	.
And	so	with	that	,	I	think	that	what	we	can	do	,	if	we	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	we	can	make	 s 	 ure 	 	that	our	future	--	our	more	perfect	future	--	 include 	 s 	 	 beekee 	 per 	 s 	 	and	it	 include 	 s 	 	bees	and	it	 include 	 s 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 meadow 	 s 	 	.
And	that	journey	--	that	journey	of	 transform 	 ation 	 	that	 occur 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	you	grow	your	meadow	and	 a 	 s 	 	you	keep	your	bees	or	you	watch	 t 	 hose 	 	native	bees	there	--	is	an	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	one	.
And	I	hope	that	you	experience	it	and	I	hope	you	tell	me	about	it	one	day	.
So	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	for	 be 	 ing 	 	here	.	Thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.

 D 	 avid 	 	 Deut 	 sch 	 	:	A	new	way	to	explain	 explan 	 ation 	 
I	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	that	,	 through 	 out 	 	the	 hundred 	 - 	 thousand 	 - 	 odd 	 	 year 	 s 	 	of	our	species	'	 exist 	 ence 	 	,	and	even	before	,	our	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	up	at	the	night	sky	,	and	 wonder 	 ed 	 	what	 star 	 s 	 	are	.
 Wonder 	 ing 	 	,	 there 	 fore 	 	,	how	to	explain	what	they	saw	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	 un 	 s 	 een 	 	.
 Oka 	 y 	 	,	so	,	most	people	 on 	 ly 	 	 wonder 	 ed 	 	that	 occasion 	 ally 	 	,	like	 to 	 day 	 	,	in	 break 	 s 	 	from	 what 	 ever 	 	 normal 	 ly 	 	 pre 	 occupied 	 	them	.
But	what	 normal 	 ly 	 	 pre 	 occupied 	 	them	 al 	 so 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	 year 	 ning 	 	to	know	.
 The 	 y 	 	 wish 	 ed 	 	they	 k 	 new 	 	how	to	prevent	 the 	 ir 	 	food	supply	from	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 fail 	 ing 	 	,	and	how	they	could	rest	when	they	 we 	 re 	 	 tire 	 d 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 risk 	 ing 	 	 starv 	 ation 	 	,	be	 warm 	 er 	 	,	 cool 	 er 	 	,	 safe 	 r 	 	,	in	less	pain	.
I	bet	 t 	 hose 	 	 pre 	 historic 	 	cave	 artist 	 s 	 	would	have	 love 	 d 	 	to	know	how	to	draw	better	.
In	every	 a 	 spect 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	,	they	 wish 	 ed 	 	for	progress	,	just	 a 	 s 	 	we	do	.
But	they	 fail 	 ed 	 	,	 al 	 most 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	,	to	make	any	.
 The 	 y 	 	did	n't	know	how	to	.
 Discover 	 ies 	 	like	fire	 happen 	 ed 	 	so	 rare 	 ly 	 	,	that	from	an	individual	's	point	of	view	,	the	world	never	 improv 	 ed 	 	.
 No 	 thing 	 	new	was	 learn 	 ed 	 	.
The	first	clue	to	the	origin	of	 star 	 light 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	1899	:	 radio 	 activity 	 	.
 With 	 in 	 	40	 year 	 s 	 	,	 physicist 	 s 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	the	whole	 explan 	 ation 	 	,	 express 	 ed 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	usual	,	in	elegant	 symbol 	 s 	 	.
But	never	mind	the	 symbol 	 s 	 	.
Think	how	 man 	 y 	 	 discover 	 ies 	 	they	represent	.
Nuclei	and	nuclear	 react 	 ions 	 	,	of	course	.
But	 isotope 	 s 	 	,	 particle 	 s 	 	of	 electric 	 ity 	 	,	 anti 	 matter 	 	,	 neutrino 	 s 	 	,	the	 con 	 version 	 	of	mass	to	energy	--	that	's	 E=mc 	 ^ 	 2 	 	--	 gam 	 ma 	 	 ray 	 s 	 	,	 trans 	 mutation 	 	.
That	ancient	dream	that	had	 al 	 ways 	 	 elude 	 d 	 	the	 al 	 chemist 	 s 	 	was	 achiev 	 ed 	 	through	these	same	 the 	 ories 	 	that	 explain 	 ed 	 	 star 	 light 	 	and	other	ancient	 myster 	 ies 	 	,	and	new	,	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 	 phenomen 	 a 	 	.
That	all	that	,	 discover 	 ed 	 	in	40	 year 	 s 	 	,	had	not	 be 	 en 	 	in	the	previous	hundred	thousand	,	was	not	for	lack	of	 think 	 ing 	 	about	 star 	 s 	 	,	and	all	 t 	 hose 	 	other	 urge 	 nt 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	they	had	.
 The 	 y 	 	even	 arriv 	 ed 	 	at	 answer 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 myth 	 s 	 	,	that	 dominate 	 d 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	,	yet	bore	 al 	 most 	 	no	 re 	 semblance 	 	to	the	truth	.
The	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	of	that	 pro 	 tract 	 ed 	 	 stag 	 nation 	 	is	n't	 sufficient 	 ly 	 	 recogn 	 ized 	 	,	I	think	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	 we 	 re 	 	people	with	 brain 	 s 	 	of	 essential 	 ly 	 	the	same	design	that	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	did	discover	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
But	that	ability	to	make	progress	 remain 	 ed 	 	 al 	 most 	 	 un 	 used 	 	,	 un 	 til 	 	the	event	that	 revolution 	 ized 	 	the	human	condition	and	 change 	 d 	 	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
Or	so	we	should	hope	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	that	event	was	the	 Scient 	 ific 	 	 R 	 evolution 	 	,	ever	since	which	our	knowledge	of	the	physical	world	,	and	of	how	to	adapt	it	to	our	 wish 	 es 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	growing	 relent 	 lessly 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	what	had	 change 	 d 	 	?
What	 we 	 re 	 	people	now	 do 	 ing 	 	for	the	first	time	that	made	that	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	 stag 	 nation 	 	and	rapid	,	 open 	 - 	 end 	 ed 	 	 discover 	 y 	 	?
How	to	make	that	 differ 	 ence 	 	is	 s 	 ure 	 ly 	 	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	universal	truth	that	it	is	possible	to	know	.
 Worry 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	there	is	no	 con 	 sens 	 us 	 	about	what	it	is	.
So	,	I	'll	tell	you	.
But	I	'll	have	to	 back 	 track 	 	a	little	first	.
 Be 	 fore 	 	the	 Scient 	 ific 	 	 R 	 evolution 	 	,	they	 believ 	 ed 	 	that	 every 	 thing 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	 know 	 able 	 	,	was	 al 	 ready 	 	known	,	 enshrin 	 ed 	 	in	ancient	 writing 	 s 	 	,	 institution 	 s 	 	,	and	in	some	 genuine 	 ly 	 	 use 	 ful 	 	 rule 	 s 	 	of	thumb	--	which	 we 	 re 	 	,	 how 	 ever 	 	,	 en 	 trench 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 dogma 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 long 	 	with	 man 	 y 	 	 false 	 hood 	 s 	 	.
So	they	 believ 	 ed 	 	that	knowledge	came	from	 author 	 ities 	 	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	 k 	 new 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	little	.
And	 there 	 fore 	 	progress	 depend 	 ed 	 	on	 learn 	 ing 	 	how	to	reject	the	 author 	 ity 	 	of	 learn 	 ed 	 	men	,	 priest 	 s 	 	,	 tradition 	 s 	 	and	 rul 	 ers 	 	.
 Whi 	 ch 	 	is	why	the	 Scient 	 ific 	 	 R 	 evolution 	 	had	to	have	a	 wide 	 r 	 	 con 	 text 	 	.
The	Enlightenment	,	a	revolution	in	how	people	 s 	 ought 	 	knowledge	,	 try 	 ing 	 	not	to	 re 	 ly 	 	on	 author 	 ity 	 	.
``	Take	no	one	's	word	for	it	.	''
But	that	ca	n't	be	what	made	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
 Author 	 ities 	 	had	 be 	 en 	 	 reject 	 ed 	 	before	,	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	.
And	that	 rare 	 ly 	 	,	if	ever	,	 caus 	 ed 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	like	the	 Scient 	 ific 	 	 R 	 evolution 	 	.
At	the	time	,	what	they	thought	 distinguish 	 ed 	 	science	was	a	radical	idea	about	 thing 	 s 	 	 un 	 s 	 een 	 	,	known	 a 	 s 	 	 empir 	 ic 	 ism 	 	.
All	knowledge	 deriv 	 es 	 	from	the	 sense 	 s 	 	.
Well	,	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	that	that	ca	n't	be	true	.
It	did	help	by	promoting	 observ 	 ation 	 	and	experiment	.
But	,	from	the	 out 	 set 	 	,	it	was	obvious	that	there	was	 some 	 thing 	 	 horr 	 ibly 	 	wrong	with	it	.
 Know 	 ledge 	 	 come 	 s 	 	from	the	 sense 	 s 	 	.
In	what	language	?	 Certain 	 ly 	 	not	the	language	of	 mathematic 	 s 	 	,	in	which	,	 Gal 	 ile 	 o 	 	 right 	 ly 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	the	book	of	nature	is	written	.
Look	at	the	world	.	You	do	n't	see	 equ 	 ations 	 	 carv 	 ed 	 	on	to	the	 mountain 	 side 	 s 	 	.
If	you	did	,	it	would	be	 be 	 cause 	 	people	had	 carv 	 ed 	 	them	.
By	the	way	,	why	do	n't	we	do	that	?
What	's	wrong	with	us	?
 Empiric 	 ism 	 	is	 in 	 ad 	 equate 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	,	well	,	scientific	 the 	 ories 	 	explain	the	 s 	 een 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	the	 un 	 s 	 een 	 	.
And	the	 un 	 s 	 een 	 	,	you	have	to	admit	,	 do 	 es 	 	n't	come	to	us	through	the	 sense 	 s 	 	.
We	do	n't	see	 t 	 hose 	 	nuclear	 react 	 ions 	 	in	 star 	 s 	 	.
We	do	n't	see	the	origin	of	species	.
We	do	n't	see	the	 curv 	 ature 	 	of	 space 	 - 	 time 	 	,	and	other	 uni 	 verse 	 s 	 	.
But	we	know	about	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
How	?
Well	,	the	classic	empiricist	answer	is	 indu 	 ction 	 	.
The	 un 	 s 	 een 	 	 resemble 	 s 	 	the	 s 	 een 	 	.
But	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	.
You	know	what	the	 cl 	 inch 	 ing 	 	evidence	was	that	 space 	 - 	 time 	 	is	 curv 	 ed 	 	?
It	was	a	photograph	,	not	of	 space 	 - 	 time 	 	,	but	of	an	eclipse	,	with	a	dot	there	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	there	.
And	the	evidence	for	evolution	?
Some	 rock 	 s 	 	and	some	 fin 	 ches 	 	.
And	parallel	 uni 	 verse 	 s 	 	?	 Aga 	 in 	 	:	 dot 	 s 	 	there	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	there	,	on	a	screen	.
What	we	see	,	in	all	these	 case 	 s 	 	,	 bear 	 s 	 	no	 re 	 semblance 	 	to	the	 re 	 ality 	 	that	we	conclude	is	 respons 	 ible 	 	--	 on 	 ly 	 	a	long	chain	of	 theoretic 	 al 	 	 reason 	 ing 	 	and	 interpret 	 ation 	 	 connect 	 s 	 	them	.
``	Ah	!	''	say	 creation 	 ists 	 	.
``	So	you	admit	it	's	all	 interpret 	 ation 	 	.
No	one	 ha 	 s 	 	ever	 s 	 een 	 	evolution	.
We	see	 rock 	 s 	 	.
You	have	your	 interpret 	 ation 	 	.	We	have	 our 	 s 	 	.
 Your 	 s 	 	 come 	 s 	 	from	 guess 	 work 	 	,	 our 	 s 	 	from	the	Bible	.	''
But	what	 creation 	 ist 	 	and	 empiricist 	 s 	 	both	 ignor 	 e 	 	is	that	,	in	that	sense	,	no	one	 ha 	 s 	 	ever	 s 	 een 	 	a	 b 	 ible 	 	either	,	that	the	eye	 on 	 ly 	 	 detect 	 s 	 	light	,	which	we	do	n't	perceive	.
 Brain 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	detect	nerve	 impulse 	 s 	 	.
And	they	do	n't	perceive	even	 t 	 hose 	 	 a 	 s 	 	what	they	 re 	 ally 	 	are	,	 name 	 ly 	 	 electric 	 al 	 	 crack 	 les 	 	.
So	we	perceive	 noth 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	what	it	 re 	 ally 	 	is	.
Our	 connect 	 ion 	 	to	 re 	 ality 	 	is	never	just	 per 	 ception 	 	.
It	's	 al 	 ways 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	Karl	 Pop 	 per 	 	put	it	,	 theor 	 y 	 - 	 lad 	 en 	 	.
 Scient 	 ific 	 	knowledge	is	n't	derived	from	 any 	 thing 	 	.
It	's	like	all	knowledge	.	It	's	 con 	 ject 	 ural 	 	,	 guess 	 work 	 	,	tested	by	 observ 	 ation 	 	,	not	derived	from	it	.
So	,	 we 	 re 	 	 test 	 able 	 	 conjecture 	 s 	 	the	great	 innov 	 ation 	 	that	 open 	 ed 	 	the	intellectual	 pri 	 son 	 	 gate 	 s 	 	?
No	.	 Contra 	 ry 	 	to	what	's	 usual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	 test 	 ability 	 	is	common	,	in	 myth 	 s 	 	and	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	other	irrational	 mode 	 s 	 	of	 think 	 ing 	 	.
Any	crank	 claim 	 ing 	 	the	 s 	 un 	 	will	go	out	next	 Tu 	 es 	 day 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	got	a	 test 	 able 	 	 predict 	 ion 	 	.
 Con 	 sider 	 	the	ancient	Greek	myth	 explain 	 ing 	 	 season 	 s 	 	.
 Had 	 es 	 	,	God	of	the	 Under 	 world 	 	,	 kidnap 	 s 	 	 Per 	 s 	 e 	 phone 	 	,	the	 God 	 de 	 s 	 s 	 	of	Spring	,	and	 negoti 	 ates 	 	a	 force 	 d 	 	marriage	contract	,	 requir 	 ing 	 	her	to	return	 regular 	 ly 	 	,	and	lets	her	go	.
And	each	year	,	she	is	 magic 	 ally 	 	 compel 	 led 	 	to	return	.
And	her	mother	,	 De 	 meter 	 	,	 God 	 de 	 s 	 s 	 	of	the	Earth	,	is	 s 	 ad 	 	,	and	 make 	 s 	 	it	cold	and	 bar 	 ren 	 	.
That	myth	is	 test 	 able 	 	.
If	winter	is	 caus 	 ed 	 	by	 De 	 meter 	 	's	 s 	 ad 	 ness 	 	,	then	it	must	happen	 every 	 where 	 	on	Earth	 simultaneous 	 ly 	 	.
So	if	the	ancient	 Greek 	 s 	 	had	 on 	 ly 	 	known	that	Australia	is	at	 it 	 s 	 	 warm 	 est 	 	when	 De 	 meter 	 	is	at	her	 s 	 add 	 est 	 	,	they	'd	have	known	that	 the 	 ir 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	is	false	.
So	what	was	wrong	with	that	myth	,	and	with	all	 pre 	 - 	 scientific 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	,	and	what	,	then	,	made	that	 moment 	 ous 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 	?
I	think	there	is	one	thing	you	have	to	care	about	.
And	that	 im 	 plies 	 	 test 	 ability 	 	,	the	scientific	method	,	the	Enlightenment	,	and	 every 	 thing 	 	.
And	here	is	the	 cruci 	 al 	 	thing	.
There	is	 s 	 uch 	 	a	thing	 a 	 s 	 	a	defect	in	a	story	.
I	do	n't	just	mean	a	logical	defect	.	I	mean	a	bad	 explan 	 ation 	 	.
What	 do 	 es 	 	that	mean	?	Well	,	 explan 	 ation 	 	is	an	 assert 	 ion 	 	about	what	's	there	,	 un 	 s 	 een 	 	,	that	 account 	 s 	 	for	what	's	 s 	 een 	 	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	the	 explan 	 atory 	 	role	of	 Per 	 s 	 e 	 phone 	 	's	marriage	contract	could	be	 play 	 ed 	 	 equal 	 ly 	 	well	by	 infinite 	 ly 	 	 man 	 y 	 	other	ad	hoc	 ent 	 ities 	 	.
Why	a	marriage	contract	and	not	any	other	reason	for	regular	annual	action	?
 He 	 re 	 	is	one	.	 Per 	 s 	 e 	 phone 	 	was	n't	released	.
She	 es 	 cap 	 ed 	 	,	and	 return 	 s 	 	every	spring	to	take	 re 	 venge 	 	on	 Had 	 es 	 	,	with	her	Spring	 power 	 s 	 	.
She	 cool 	 s 	 	his	domain	with	Spring	air	,	 vent 	 ing 	 	heat	up	to	the	surface	,	creating	summer	.
That	 account 	 s 	 	for	the	same	 phenomen 	 a 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	original	myth	.
It	's	 equal 	 ly 	 	 test 	 able 	 	.
 Y 	 et 	 	what	it	 assert 	 s 	 	about	 re 	 ality 	 	is	,	in	 man 	 y 	 	ways	,	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	.
And	that	is	possible	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 detail 	 s 	 	of	the	original	myth	are	 un 	 related 	 	to	 season 	 s 	 	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	via	the	myth	 it 	 self 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	easy	 vari 	 ability 	 	is	the	sign	of	a	bad	 explan 	 ation 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	a	functional	reason	to	prefer	one	of	 count 	 less 	 	 vari 	 ants 	 	,	 advoc 	 ating 	 	one	of	them	,	in	 pre 	 ference 	 	to	the	 other 	 s 	 	,	is	irrational	.
So	,	for	the	 es 	 s 	 ence 	 	of	what	 make 	 s 	 	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	to	 en 	 able 	 	progress	,	seek	good	 explan 	 ations 	 	,	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	ca	n't	be	 eas 	 ily 	 	 vari 	 ed 	 	,	while	still	 explain 	 ing 	 	the	 phenomen 	 a 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	our	current	 explan 	 ation 	 	of	 season 	 s 	 	is	that	the	Earth	's	axis	is	 tilt 	 ed 	 	like	that	,	so	each	 hemi 	 sphere 	 	 tilt 	 s 	 	 to 	 ward 	 	the	 s 	 un 	 	for	half	the	year	,	and	away	for	the	other	half	.
Better	put	that	up	.
That	's	a	good	 explan 	 ation 	 	:	hard	to	vary	,	 be 	 cause 	 	every	detail	 play 	 s 	 	a	functional	role	.
For	 in 	 stance 	 	,	we	know	,	 in 	 dependent 	 ly 	 	of	 season 	 s 	 	,	that	 surface 	 s 	 	 tilt 	 ed 	 	away	from	 radi 	 ant 	 	heat	are	heated	less	,	and	that	a	 s 	 pinning 	 	sphere	,	in	space	,	 point 	 s 	 	in	a	constant	direction	.
And	the	tilt	 al 	 so 	 	 explain 	 s 	 	the	 s 	 un 	 	's	angle	of	 elev 	 ation 	 	at	different	 time 	 s 	 	of	year	,	and	 predict 	 s 	 	that	the	 season 	 s 	 	will	be	out	of	phase	in	the	two	 hemi 	 sphere 	 s 	 	.
If	they	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 observ 	 ed 	 	in	phase	,	the	 theor 	 y 	 	would	have	 be 	 en 	 	 re 	 fu 	 ted 	 	.
But	now	,	the	fact	that	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	good	 explan 	 ation 	 	,	hard	to	vary	,	 make 	 s 	 	the	 cruci 	 al 	 	 differ 	 ence 	 	.
If	the	ancient	 Greek 	 s 	 	had	found	out	about	 season 	 s 	 	in	Australia	,	they	could	have	 eas 	 ily 	 	 vari 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	myth	to	predict	that	.
For	 in 	 stance 	 	,	when	 De 	 meter 	 	is	 up 	 set 	 	,	she	 banish 	 es 	 	heat	from	her	 vic 	 in 	 ity 	 	,	 in 	 to 	 	the	other	 hemi 	 sphere 	 	,	where	it	 make 	 s 	 	summer	.
So	,	 be 	 ing 	 	 prov 	 ed 	 	wrong	by	 observ 	 ation 	 	,	and	changing	 the 	 ir 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	 accord 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	still	would	n't	have	got	the	ancient	 Greek 	 s 	 	one	 jo 	 t 	 	 close 	 r 	 	to	 understand 	 ing 	 	 season 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 explan 	 ation 	 	was	bad	:	easy	to	vary	.
And	it	's	 on 	 ly 	 	when	an	 explan 	 ation 	 	is	good	that	it	even	 matter 	 s 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	it	's	 test 	 able 	 	.
If	the	 axis 	 - 	 tilt 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	had	 be 	 en 	 	 re 	 fu 	 ted 	 	,	 it 	 s 	 	 defend 	 ers 	 	would	have	had	 no 	 where 	 	to	go	.
No	 eas 	 ily 	 	 implement 	 ed 	 	change	could	make	that	tilt	cause	the	same	 season 	 s 	 	in	both	 hemi 	 sphere 	 s 	 	.
The	search	for	 hard 	 - 	 to 	 - 	 vary 	 	 explan 	 ations 	 	is	the	origin	of	all	progress	.
It	's	the	 bas 	 ic 	 	 regulat 	 ing 	 	principle	of	the	Enlightenment	.
So	,	in	science	,	two	false	 approach 	 es 	 	 b 	 light 	 	progress	.
One	is	well	known	:	 un 	 test 	 able 	 	 the 	 ories 	 	.
But	the	more	 import 	 ant 	 	one	is	 explan 	 ation 	 less 	 	 the 	 ories 	 	.
 When 	 ever 	 	you	're	told	that	some	 exist 	 ing 	 	 statistic 	 al 	 	trend	will	 continu 	 e 	 	,	but	you	are	n't	 give 	 n 	 	a	 hard 	 - 	 to 	 - 	 vary 	 	account	of	what	 cause 	 s 	 	that	trend	,	you	're	 be 	 ing 	 	told	a	wizard	did	it	.
When	you	are	told	that	 carrot 	 s 	 	have	human	 right 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	share	half	our	 gene 	 s 	 	--	but	not	how	gene	 percent 	 age 	 s 	 	confer	 right 	 s 	 	--	wizard	.
When	 some 	 one 	 	 announce 	 s 	 	that	the	 nature 	 - 	 nurture 	 	debate	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 settl 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	there	is	evidence	that	a	 give 	 n 	 	 percent 	 age 	 	of	our	 politic 	 al 	 	 opinion 	 s 	 	are	 genetic 	 ally 	 	 inherit 	 ed 	 	,	but	they	do	n't	explain	how	 gene 	 s 	 	cause	 opinion 	 s 	 	,	they	've	 settl 	 ed 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	.	 The 	 y 	 	are	 say 	 ing 	 	that	our	 opinion 	 s 	 	are	 caus 	 ed 	 	by	 wizard 	 s 	 	,	and	 pre 	 sum 	 ably 	 	so	are	 the 	 ir 	 	own	.
That	the	truth	 consist 	 s 	 	of	hard	to	vary	 assert 	 ions 	 	about	 re 	 ality 	 	is	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	fact	about	the	physical	world	.
It	's	a	fact	that	is	,	 it 	 self 	 	,	 un 	 s 	 een 	 	,	yet	 im 	 possible 	 	to	vary	.	Thank	you	.

 Y 	 ves 	 	 Ross 	 y 	 	:	 F 	 ly 	 	with	the	 Jet 	 man 	 
Text	:	 Jet 	 man 	 	-	 Y 	 ves 	 	 Ross 	 y 	 	Grand	Canyon	 Nar 	 rator 	 	:	 Man 	 y 	 	of	the	 test 	 s 	 	are	 conduct 	 ed 	 	while	 Y 	 ves 	 	is	 s 	 trapped 	 	onto	the	wing	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 Y 	 ves 	 	'	body	is	an	 integ 	 ral 	 	part	of	the	 air 	 craft 	 	.
Text	:	Wind	tunnel	 test 	 s 	 	 Nar 	 rator 	 	:	The	wing	 ha 	 s 	 	no	 steer 	 ing 	 	 control 	 s 	 	,	no	 flap 	 s 	 	,	no	 rud 	 der 	 	.
 Y 	 ves 	 	uses	his	body	to	steer	the	wing	.
Stefan	von	 Berg 	 en 	 	:	Well	he	 turn 	 s 	 	by	just	 put 	 ting 	 	his	head	on	one	or	the	other	side	.
And	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	he	 assist 	 s 	 	that	with	his	 hand 	 s 	 	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	even	with	the	leg	.
He	's	 act 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	human	 fuse 	 l 	 age 	 	,	so	to	say	.
And	that	's	 quit 	 e 	 	 un 	 ique 	 	.
 Nar 	 rator 	 	:	When	he	 arche 	 s 	 	his	back	,	he	 gain 	 s 	 	altitude	.
When	he	 push 	 es 	 	his	 shoulder 	 s 	 	forward	,	he	 go 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	 d 	 ive 	 	.
Text	:	Swiss	 Al 	 ps 	 	 S 	 trait 	 	of	 Gib 	 ral 	 tar 	 	 cross 	 ing 	 	English	 Cha 	 nnel 	 	 cross 	 ing 	 	 Com 	 ment 	 ator 	 	:	There	he	 go 	 es 	 	.
There	is	 Y 	 ves 	 	 Ross 	 y 	 	.
And	I	think	the	wing	is	open	,	the	wing	is	open	.
So	our	first	critical	moment	,	it	's	open	.
He	is	down	.	 I 	 s 	 	he	 fly 	 ing 	 	?
 Com 	 ment 	 ator 	 	Two	:	It	 look 	 s 	 	like	he	's	 stabil 	 ized 	 	.
He	's	 start 	 ing 	 	to	make	his	climb	.
 Com 	 ment 	 ator 	 	:	There	's	that	90	degree	turn	you	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	,	taking	him	out	.
He	's	out	over	the	channel	.
There	is	 Y 	 ves 	 	 Ross 	 y 	 	.
There	is	no	 turn 	 ing 	 	back	now	.
He	is	over	the	English	 Cha 	 nnel 	 	and	 under 	 way 	 	.
 Lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	,	an	historic	flight	 ha 	 s 	 	 beg 	 un 	 	.
 Com 	 ment 	 ator 	 	Two	:	And	what	he	's	going	to	do	 a 	 s 	 	he	 approach 	 es 	 	the	ground	is	pull	down	on	 t 	 hose 	 	 toggle 	 s 	 	to	flare	,	 s 	 low 	 	 him 	 self 	 	down	just	a	little	bit	,	and	then	come	in	for	a	nice	 land 	 ing 	 	.
 Com 	 ment 	 ator 	 	:	There	he	is	.
 Y 	 ves 	 	 Ross 	 y 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 land 	 ed 	 	in	 Eng 	 land 	 	.
 Bru 	 no 	 	Giussani	:	And	now	he	's	in	 Edi 	 nburgh 	 	.	 Y 	 ves 	 	 Ross 	 y 	 	.
And	his	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
 Y 	 ves 	 	,	welcome	.	It	is	 quit 	 e 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
 T 	 hose 	 	 sequence 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	shot	over	the	last	three	 year 	 s 	 	in	 vari 	 ous 	 	 moment 	 s 	 	of	your	 activ 	 ities 	 	.
And	there	 we 	 re 	 	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 other 	 s 	 	.
So	it	's	possible	to	fly	 al 	 most 	 	like	a	bird	.
What	is	it	[	like	]	to	be	up	there	?
 Y 	 ves 	 	 Ross 	 y 	 	:	It	's	 f 	 un 	 	.	It	's	 f 	 un 	 	.
I	do	n't	have	 feather 	 s 	 	.
But	I	feel	like	a	bird	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	.
It	's	 re 	 ally 	 	an	 un 	 real 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 normal 	 ly 	 	you	have	a	big	thing	,	a	plane	,	around	you	.
And	when	I	 s 	 trap 	 	just	these	little	 harness 	 es 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	little	wing	,	I	 re 	 ally 	 	have	the	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	a	bird	.
 B 	 G 	 	:	How	did	you	start	to	 be 	 come 	 	 Jet 	 man 	 	?
 Y 	 R 	 	:	It	was	about	20	 year 	 s 	 	ago	when	I	 discover 	 ed 	 	free	 fall 	 ing 	 	.
When	you	go	out	of	an	 air 	 plane 	 	you	are	 al 	 most 	 	naked	.
You	take	a	position	like	that	.
And	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	when	you	take	a	 track 	 ing 	 	position	,	you	have	the	 feel 	 ing 	 	that	you	are	 fly 	 ing 	 	.
And	that	's	the	 near 	 est 	 	thing	to	the	dream	.
You	have	no	machine	around	you	.
You	are	just	in	the	element	.
It	's	 ver 	 y 	 	short	and	 on 	 ly 	 	in	one	direction	.
So	the	idea	was	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	keep	that	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	 free 	 dom 	 	,	but	change	the	vector	and	 in 	 crease 	 	the	time	.
 B 	 G 	 	:	So	I	'm	kind	of	 cur 	 ious 	 	,	what	's	your	top	speed	?
 Y 	 R 	 	:	It	's	about	300	km	per	hour	before	 loop 	 ing 	 	.
That	 mean 	 s 	 	about	190	 mile 	 s 	 	per	hour	.
 B 	 G 	 	:	And	what	's	the	weight	of	the	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	you	're	 carry 	 ing 	 	?
 Y 	 R 	 	:	When	I	exit	full	of	 ker 	 os 	 ene 	 	,	I	'm	about	55	 kilo 	 s 	 	.
I	have	55	 kilo 	 s 	 	on	my	back	.
 B 	 G 	 	:	And	you	're	not	 pilot 	 ing 	 	?
There	is	no	handle	,	no	 steer 	 ing 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	?
It	is	 pur 	 e 	 ly 	 	your	body	,	and	the	 wing 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	part	of	the	body	and	vice	versa	?
 Y 	 R 	 	:	That	's	 re 	 ally 	 	the	goal	,	 be 	 cause 	 	if	you	put	[	in	]	 steer 	 ing 	 	,	then	you	 re 	 invent 	 	the	 air 	 plane 	 	.
And	I	 want 	 ed 	 	to	keep	 th 	 is 	 	 free 	 dom 	 	of	 move 	 ment 	 	.
And	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	like	the	kid	 play 	 ing 	 	the	 air 	 plane 	 	.
I	want	to	go	down	like	that	.
And	up	I	climb	,	I	turn	.
It	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 pur 	 e 	 	 fly 	 ing 	 	.
It	's	not	 steer 	 ing 	 	,	it	's	flight	.
 B 	 G 	 	:	What	kind	of	training	do	you	do	,	you	 personal 	 ly 	 	,	for	that	?
 Y 	 R 	 	:	 Actu 	 ally 	 	,	I	try	to	stay	just	fit	.
I	do	n't	do	special	physical	training	.
Just	,	I	try	to	keep	my	 mobil 	 ity 	 	through	new	 activ 	 ities 	 	.
For	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	last	winter	I	 beg 	 an 	 	with	kite	surfing	--	so	new	 thing 	 s 	 	.
So	you	have	to	adapt	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	--	I	'm	 quit 	 e 	 	an	 experience 	 d 	 	 manage 	 r 	 	of	 system 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	pilot	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	--	you	need	 fluid 	 ity 	 	,	you	need	to	be	 ag 	 ile 	 	and	 al 	 so 	 	to	adapt	 re 	 ally 	 	fast	.
 B 	 G 	 	:	 Some 	 body 	 	in	the	audience	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	,	``	How	 do 	 es 	 	he	breathe	up	there	?	''
 be 	 cause 	 	you	're	going	fast	and	you	're	up	3,000	 meter 	 s 	 	or	so	.
 Y 	 R 	 	:	 Oka 	 y 	 	,	up	to	3,000	 meter 	 s 	 	,	it	's	not	 s 	 uch 	 	a	big	problem	with	oxygen	.
But	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 bike 	 rs 	 	,	they	have	the	same	speed	.
Just	with	the	helmet	,	 integ 	 ral 	 	helmet	,	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	no	problem	to	breathe	.
 B 	 G 	 	:	 De 	 scribe 	 	for	me	the	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	since	you	have	it	here	.
So	 Breitl 	 ing 	 	's	four	 engine 	 s 	 	.
 Y 	 R 	 	:	Yeah	,	 two 	 - 	 meter 	 	span	.
 Ultra 	 s 	 table 	 	profile	.
Four	little	 engine 	 s 	 	,	22	 kilo 	 s 	 	thrust	each	,	 turbine 	 s 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	with	 ker 	 os 	 ene 	 	.
 Har 	 ness 	 	,	 parachut 	 e 	 	.
My	 on 	 ly 	 	 instrument 	 s 	 	are	[	an	]	 al 	 time 	 ter 	 	and	time	.
I	know	I	have	about	eight	 minute 	 s 	 	fuel	.
So	just	check	before	it	's	 finish 	 ed 	 	.
And	 yea 	 h 	 	,	that	's	all	.
Two	 parachut 	 es 	 	.
That	 mean 	 s 	 	,	if	I	have	a	problem	with	the	first	one	I	pull	,	I	still	have	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	to	open	the	second	one	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	my	life	.
That	's	the	real	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	about	 safe 	 ty 	 	.
I	did	use	that	 dur 	 ing 	 	these	last	15	 year 	 s 	 	about	20	 time 	 s 	 	--	never	with	that	type	of	wing	,	but	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	.
I	can	 re 	 lease 	 	my	wing	when	I	am	in	a	spin	or	 un 	 s 	 table 	 	.
 B 	 G 	 	:	We	saw	the	2009	 cross 	 ing 	 	of	the	 Gib 	 ral 	 tar 	 	 S 	 trait 	 	where	you	lost	control	and	then	you	 div 	 ed 	 	down	 in 	 to 	 	the	 cloud 	 s 	 	and	in	the	ocean	.
So	that	was	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 case 	 s 	 	where	you	let	the	 wing 	 s 	 	go	,	right	?
 Y 	 R 	 	:	Yeah	.	I	did	try	in	[	the	]	 cloud 	 s 	 	,	but	you	lose	[	 orient 	 ation 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	]	.
So	I	did	try	to	take	,	 aga 	 in 	 	,	a	climb	altitude	.
I	thought	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	I	will	go	out	.
But	most	 prob 	 ably 	 	I	did	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	.
 B 	 G 	 	:	 Some 	 thing 	 	that	is	not	 ver 	 y 	 	safe	in	image	.
 Y 	 R 	 	:	But	you	feel	great	,	but	you	have	not	the	right	altitude	.
So	the	next	thing	I	saw	was	just	blue	.
It	was	the	sea	.
I	have	 al 	 so 	 	an	audible	 al 	 time 	 ter 	 	.
So	I	was	at	my	 minim 	 um 	 	altitude	in	that	vector	--	fast	--	so	I	 pull 	 ed 	 	that	.
And	then	I	did	open	my	chute	.
 B 	 G 	 	:	So	the	 wing 	 s 	 	have	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 parachut 	 e 	 	,	and	you	have	your	two	 parachut 	 es 	 	.
 Y 	 R 	 	:	 Ex 	 act 	 ly 	 	.	There	is	a	 rescu 	 e 	 	 parachut 	 e 	 	for	the	wing	for	two	 reason 	 s 	 	:	so	I	can	repair	it	 after 	 ward 	 	and	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	so	 no 	 body 	 	 take 	 s 	 	that	,	just	on	his	head	.
 B 	 G 	 	:	I	see	.	 May 	 be 	 	come	back	here	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 risk 	 y 	 	stuff	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	.
People	have	 di 	 ed 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	thing	.
And	you	do	n't	look	like	a	crazy	guy	;	you	're	a	Swiss	 air 	 line 	 	pilot	,	so	you	're	 ra 	 ther 	 	a	 check 	 list 	 	kind	of	guy	.
I	 assum 	 e 	 	you	have	 standard 	 s 	 	.
 Y 	 R 	 	:	Yeah	.	I	have	no	 check 	 list 	 	for	that	.
 B 	 G 	 	:	Let	's	not	tell	you	 employ 	 er 	 	.
 Y 	 R 	 	:	No	,	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	two	 world 	 s 	 	.
Civil	 av 	 iation 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	know	 ver 	 y 	 	well	.
We	have	a	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	of	experience	.
And	you	can	adapt	 re 	 ally 	 	 precise 	 ly 	 	.
With	that	,	I	have	to	adapt	to	 some 	 thing 	 	new	.
That	 mean 	 s 	 	 improv 	 ise 	 	.
So	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	a	play	between	these	two	 approach 	 es 	 	.
 Some 	 thing 	 	that	I	know	 ver 	 y 	 	well	--	these	 principle 	 s 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	we	have	two	 engine 	 s 	 	on	an	 Air 	 bus 	 	;	with	 on 	 ly 	 	one	engine	,	you	can	fly	it	.
So	plan	B	,	 al 	 ways 	 	a	plan	B	.
In	a	 fight 	 er 	 	,	you	have	an	 eject 	 ion 	 	seat	.
That	's	my	 eject 	 ion 	 	seat	.
So	I	have	the	approach	of	a	professional	pilot	with	the	respect	of	a	pioneer	in	front	of	Mother	Nature	.
 B 	 G 	 	:	It	's	well	 s 	 aid 	 	.	It	's	well	 s 	 aid 	 	.
What	 happen 	 s 	 	if	one	of	the	 engine 	 s 	 	 stop 	 s 	 	?
 Y 	 R 	 	:	I	do	a	roll	.
And	then	I	 stabil 	 ize 	 	,	and	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	my	altitude	,	I	 continu 	 e 	 	on	two	or	three	 engine 	 s 	 	.
It	's	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	possible	--	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	to	explain	--	but	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	which	regime	I	was	,	I	can	 continu 	 e 	 	on	two	and	try	to	get	a	nice	place	to	land	,	and	then	I	open	my	 parachut 	 e 	 	.
 B 	 G 	 	:	So	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	of	the	flight	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	you	jump	off	a	plane	or	a	helicopter	,	and	you	go	on	a	 d 	 ive 	 	and	 accele 	 rate 	 	the	 engine 	 s 	 	,	and	then	you	 bas 	 ically 	 	take	off	 mid 	 - 	 air 	 	 some 	 where 	 	.
And	then	the	 land 	 ing 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	have	 s 	 een 	 	,	 arriv 	 ing 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	side	of	the	channel	,	is	through	a	 parachut 	 e 	 	.
So	just	 a 	 s 	 	a	curiosity	,	where	did	you	land	when	you	flew	over	the	Grand	Canyon	?
Did	you	land	on	the	rim	,	down	at	the	bottom	?
 Y 	 R 	 	:	It	was	down	on	the	bottom	.
And	I	came	back	 after 	 ward 	 	on	the	 s 	 led 	 	of	the	helicopter	back	.
But	it	was	too	 stone 	 y 	 	and	full	of	 c 	 actu 	 s 	 	on	top	.
 B 	 G 	 	:	That	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	why	I	 ask 	 ed 	 	the	question	.
 Y 	 R 	 	:	And	 al 	 so 	 	the	 current 	 s 	 	are	 quit 	 e 	 	funny	there	.
There	is	big	thermal	activity	,	big	 differ 	 ence 	 	in	altitude	 al 	 so 	 	.
So	it	was	much	 safe 	 r 	 	for	me	to	land	at	the	bottom	.
 B 	 G 	 	:	So	I	think	that	right	now	,	 man 	 y 	 	people	in	the	audience	are	 ask 	 ing 	 	,	``	 Oka 	 y 	 	,	when	are	you	 develop 	 ing 	 	a	 double 	 - 	 s 	 eater 	 	so	they	can	fly	with	you	?	''
 Y 	 R 	 	:	I	have	a	standard	answer	.
 Hav 	 e 	 	you	ever	 s 	 een 	 	tandem	 bird 	 s 	 	?
 B 	 G 	 	:	Perfect	answer	.
 Y 	 ves 	 	,	one	last	question	.
What	's	next	for	you	?	What	's	next	for	 Jet 	 man 	 	?
 Y 	 R 	 	:	First	,	to	instruct	a	 young 	 er 	 	guy	.
I	want	to	share	it	,	to	do	 form 	 ation 	 	 flight 	 s 	 	.
And	I	plan	to	start	from	a	cliff	,	like	 catapult 	 ed 	 	from	a	cliff	.
 B 	 G 	 	:	So	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 jump 	 ing 	 	off	a	plane	,	 y 	 es 	 	?
 Y 	 R 	 	:	Yes	,	with	the	final	goal	to	take	off	,	but	with	 initi 	 al 	 	speed	.
 Re 	 ally 	 	,	I	go	step	by	step	.
It	 seem 	 s 	 	a	little	bit	crazy	,	but	it	's	not	.
It	's	possible	to	start	 al 	 ready 	 	now	,	it	's	just	too	 danger 	 ous 	 	.
 Thank 	 s 	 	to	the	increasing	technology	,	better	technology	,	it	will	be	safe	.
And	I	hope	it	will	be	for	 every 	 body 	 	.
 B 	 G 	 	:	 Y 	 ves 	 	,	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.	 Y 	 ves 	 	 Ross 	 y 	 	.

 Jo 	 sh 	 	Silver	 demo 	 s 	 	 adjust 	 able 	 	 liquid 	 - 	 fill 	 ed 	 	 eye 	 glass 	 es 	 
I	'm	going	to	tell	you	about	one	of	the	world	's	largest	 problem 	 s 	 	and	how	it	can	be	 solve 	 d 	 	.
I	'd	like	to	start	with	a	little	experiment	.
 Cou 	 ld 	 	you	put	your	hand	up	if	you	wear	 glass 	 es 	 	or	contact	 lens 	 es 	 	,	or	you	've	had	laser	 refr 	 active 	 	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	?
 N 	 ow 	 	,	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	there	are	too	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	for	me	to	do	the	 statistic 	 s 	 	 proper 	 ly 	 	.
But	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	--	I	'm	 guess 	 ing 	 	--	that	it	'll	be	about	60	percent	of	the	room	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	 rough 	 ly 	 	the	fraction	of	 develop 	 ed 	 	world	population	that	have	some	sort	of	vision	 correct 	 ion 	 	.
The	World	Health	 Organ 	 ization 	 	 estimate 	 s 	 	--	well	,	they	make	 vari 	 ous 	 	 estimate 	 s 	 	of	the	number	of	people	who	need	 glass 	 es 	 	--	the	 low 	 est 	 	estimate	is	150	million	people	.
 The 	 y 	 	 al 	 so 	 	have	an	estimate	of	around	a	billion	.
But	in	fact	,	I	would	 argu 	 e 	 	that	we	've	just	 d 	 one 	 	an	experiment	here	and	now	,	which	 show 	 s 	 	us	that	the	global	need	for	 correct 	 ive 	 	 eye 	 wear 	 	is	around	half	of	any	population	.
And	the	problem	of	poor	vision	,	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	not	just	a	health	problem	,	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	an	 education 	 al 	 	problem	,	and	it	's	an	economic	problem	,	and	it	's	a	quality	of	life	problem	.
 Glass 	 es 	 	are	not	 ver 	 y 	 	expensive	.	 The 	 y 	 	're	 quit 	 e 	 	 ple 	 nt 	 iful 	 	.
The	problem	is	,	there	are	n't	 en 	 ough 	 	eye	care	 professional 	 s 	 	in	the	world	to	use	the	model	of	the	 deliver 	 y 	 	of	 correct 	 ive 	 	 eye 	 wear 	 	that	we	have	in	the	 develop 	 ed 	 	world	.
There	are	just	way	too	few	eye	care	 professional 	 s 	 	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	little	slide	here	 show 	 s 	 	you	an	optometrist	and	the	little	blue	person	 represent 	 s 	 	about	10,000	people	and	that	's	the	ratio	in	the	 U. 	 K 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	ratio	of	 optometrist 	 s 	 	to	people	in	 sub 	 - 	 Saharan 	 	 Afri 	 ca 	 	.
In	fact	,	there	are	some	 count 	 ries 	 	in	 sub 	 - 	 Saharan 	 	 Afri 	 ca 	 	where	there	's	one	optometrist	for	eight	million	of	the	population	.
How	do	you	do	 th 	 is 	 	?	How	do	you	solve	 th 	 is 	 	problem	?
I	came	up	with	a	solution	to	 th 	 is 	 	problem	,	and	I	came	up	with	a	solution	based	on	 adapt 	 ive 	 	 optic 	 s 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	.
And	the	idea	is	you	make	eye	 glass 	 es 	 	,	and	you	adjust	them	 your 	 self 	 	and	that	 solve 	 s 	 	the	problem	.
What	I	want	to	do	is	to	show	you	that	one	can	make	a	pair	of	 glass 	 es 	 	.
I	 s 	 hall 	 	just	show	you	how	you	make	a	pair	of	 glass 	 es 	 	.	I	 s 	 hall 	 	pop	 th 	 is 	 	in	my	pocket	.
I	'm	short	 sight 	 ed 	 	.	I	look	at	the	 sign 	 s 	 	at	the	end	,	I	can	 hard 	 ly 	 	see	them	.
So	--	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	I	can	now	see	that	man	running	out	there	,	and	I	can	see	that	guy	running	out	there	.
I	've	now	made	prescription	 eye 	 wear 	 	to	my	prescription	.
Next	step	in	my	process	.
So	,	I	've	now	made	eye	 glass 	 es 	 	to	my	prescription	.
 Oka 	 y 	 	,	so	I	've	made	these	 glass 	 es 	 	and	...
 Oka 	 y 	 	,	I	've	made	the	 glass 	 es 	 	to	my	prescription	and	...
...	I	've	just	...
And	I	've	now	made	some	 glass 	 es 	 	.	That	's	it	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	these	are	n't	the	 on 	 ly 	 	pair	in	the	world	.
In	fact	,	 th 	 is 	 	technology	's	 be 	 en 	 	 evolv 	 ing 	 	.
I	 start 	 ed 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	it	in	1985	,	and	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	 evolv 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	.
There	are	about	30,000	in	use	now	.
And	they	're	in	fifteen	 count 	 ries 	 	.	 The 	 y 	 	're	spread	around	the	world	.
And	I	have	a	vision	,	which	I	'll	share	with	you	.
I	have	a	global	vision	for	vision	.
And	that	vision	is	to	try	to	get	a	billion	people	 wear 	 ing 	 	the	 glass 	 es 	 	they	need	by	the	year	2020	.
To	do	that	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	early	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	the	technology	.
The	technology	is	 be 	 ing 	 	further	 develop 	 ed 	 	--	the	cost	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	 br 	 ought 	 	down	.
 Th 	 is 	 	pair	,	in	fact	,	these	 current 	 ly 	 	cost	about	19	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
But	the	cost	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	 br 	 ought 	 	right	down	.
It	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	 br 	 ought 	 	down	 be 	 cause 	 	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	serve	 population 	 s 	 	who	live	on	a	dollar	a	day	.
How	do	you	solve	 th 	 is 	 	problem	?
You	start	to	get	 in 	 to 	 	detail	.
And	on	 th 	 is 	 	slide	,	I	'm	 bas 	 ically 	 	 explain 	 ing 	 	all	the	 problem 	 s 	 	you	have	.
How	do	you	 distribut 	 e 	 	?	How	do	you	work	out	how	to	fit	the	thing	?
How	do	you	have	people	 real 	 izing 	 	that	they	have	a	vision	problem	?
How	do	you	deal	with	the	industry	?
And	the	answer	to	that	is	research	.
What	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	is	to	set	up	the	 Cent 	 er 	 	for	 Vis 	 ion 	 	in	the	 Develop 	 ing 	 	World	here	in	the	university	.
If	you	want	to	know	more	,	just	come	have	a	look	at	our	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	.	Thank	you	.

 Stefan 	 o 	 	 Man 	 cus 	 o 	 	:	The	 root 	 s 	 	of	plant	 intellig 	 ence 	 
 Some 	 time 	 s 	 	I	go	 brow 	 s 	 ing 	 	[	through	]	a	 ver 	 y 	 	old	magazine	.
I	found	 th 	 is 	 	 observ 	 ation 	 	test	about	the	story	of	the	ark	.
And	the	artist	that	drew	 th 	 is 	 	 observ 	 ation 	 	test	did	some	 error 	 s 	 	,	had	some	 mistak 	 es 	 	--	there	are	more	or	less	12	 mistak 	 es 	 	.
Some	of	them	are	 ver 	 y 	 	easy	.
There	is	a	funnel	,	an	 a 	 erial 	 	part	,	a	lamp	and	 clock 	 work 	 	key	on	the	ark	.
Some	of	them	are	about	the	 animal 	 s 	 	,	the	number	.
But	there	is	a	much	more	fundamental	 mistak 	 e 	 	in	the	 over 	 all 	 	story	of	the	ark	that	's	not	 report 	 ed 	 	here	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	problem	is	:	where	are	the	 plant 	 s 	 	?
So	now	we	have	God	that	is	going	to	 sub 	 merge 	 	Earth	 permanent 	 ly 	 	or	at	 l 	 east 	 	for	a	 ver 	 y 	 	long	period	,	and	no	one	is	taking	care	of	 plant 	 s 	 	.
 No 	 ah 	 	 need 	 ed 	 	to	take	two	of	every	kind	of	bird	,	of	every	kind	of	animal	,	of	every	kind	of	creature	that	 move 	 s 	 	,	but	no	 ment 	 ion 	 	about	 plant 	 s 	 	.
Why	?
In	 an 	 other 	 	part	of	the	same	story	,	all	the	living	 creature 	 s 	 	are	just	the	living	 creature 	 s 	 	that	came	out	from	the	ark	,	so	 bird 	 s 	 	,	 live 	 stock 	 	and	wild	 animal 	 s 	 	.
 Plan 	 ts 	 	are	not	living	 creature 	 s 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	point	.
That	is	a	point	that	is	not	coming	out	from	the	Bible	,	but	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 accompani 	 ed 	 	 human 	 ity 	 	.
Let	's	have	a	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	nice	code	that	is	coming	from	a	 Ren 	 aiss 	 ance 	 	book	.
 He 	 re 	 	we	have	the	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	of	the	order	of	nature	.
It	's	a	nice	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 start 	 ing 	 	from	left	--	you	have	the	 stone 	 s 	 	--	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	after	the	 stone 	 s 	 	,	the	 plant 	 s 	 	that	are	just	able	to	live	.
We	have	the	 animal 	 s 	 	that	are	able	to	live	and	to	sense	,	and	on	the	top	of	the	pyramid	,	there	is	the	man	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	not	the	common	man	.
The	``	 Hom 	 o 	 	 studio 	 s 	 us 	 	''	--	the	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	man	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 quit 	 e 	 	 comfort 	 ing 	 	for	people	like	me	--	I	'm	a	professor	--	 th 	 is 	 	to	be	over	there	on	the	top	of	creation	.
But	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	wrong	.
You	know	 ver 	 y 	 	well	about	 professor 	 s 	 	.
But	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	wrong	about	 plant 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 plant 	 s 	 	are	not	just	able	to	live	;	they	are	able	to	sense	.
 The 	 y 	 	are	much	more	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	in	 sens 	 ing 	 	than	 animal 	 s 	 	.
Just	to	give	you	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	every	single	root	 ap 	 ex 	 	is	able	to	detect	and	to	monitor	 con 	 current 	 ly 	 	and	 continu 	 ously 	 	at	 l 	 east 	 	15	different	chemical	and	physical	 parameter 	 s 	 	.
And	they	 al 	 so 	 	are	able	to	show	and	to	exhibit	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	and	complex	behavior	that	can	be	 de 	 scribed 	 	just	with	the	term	of	 intellig 	 ence 	 	.
Well	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	 under 	 estimation 	 	of	 plant 	 s 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	is	 al 	 ways 	 	with	us	.
Let	's	have	a	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	short	movie	now	.
We	have	 D 	 avid 	 	 Atten 	 bo 	 rough 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	 D 	 avid 	 	 Atten 	 bo 	 rough 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	a	plant	lover	;	he	did	some	of	the	most	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 movie 	 s 	 	about	plant	behavior	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	when	he	 speak 	 s 	 	about	 plant 	 s 	 	,	 every 	 thing 	 	is	correct	.
When	he	 speak 	 s 	 	about	 animal 	 s 	 	,	[	he	]	 tend 	 s 	 	to	 re 	 move 	 	the	fact	that	 plant 	 s 	 	exist	.
The	blue	whale	,	the	 big 	 gest 	 	creature	that	 exist 	 s 	 	on	the	planet	--	that	is	wrong	,	 complete 	 ly 	 	wrong	.
The	blue	whale	,	it	's	a	dwarf	if	 compar 	 ed 	 	with	the	real	 big 	 gest 	 	creature	that	 exist 	 s 	 	on	the	planet	--	that	is	,	 th 	 is 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	,	 magnific 	 ent 	 	 Sequ 	 oia 	 dendron 	 	 giga 	 nte 	 um 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	living	organism	that	 ha 	 s 	 	a	mass	of	at	 l 	 east 	 	2,000	 ton 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	the	story	that	 plant 	 s 	 	are	some	 low 	 - 	 level 	 	 organism 	 s 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 form 	 al 	 ized 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 time 	 s 	 	ago	by	Aristotle	,	that	in	``	De	Anima	''	--	that	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 in 	 fluent 	 ial 	 	book	for	the	Western	 civil 	 ization 	 	--	wrote	that	the	 plant 	 s 	 	are	on	the	edge	between	living	and	not	living	.
 The 	 y 	 	have	just	a	kind	of	 ver 	 y 	 	 low 	 - 	 level 	 	soul	.
It	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 veget 	 ative 	 	soul	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	lack	 move 	 ment 	 	,	and	so	they	do	n't	need	to	sense	.
Let	's	see	.
 Oka 	 y 	 	,	some	of	the	 move 	 ments 	 	of	the	 plant 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 well 	 - 	 known 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	fast	 move 	 ment 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	Dionaea	,	a	 Ven 	 us 	 	fly	trap	 hunt 	 ing 	 	 s 	 nail 	 s 	 	--	sorry	for	the	 s 	 nail 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 re 	 fused 	 	for	centuries	,	 de 	 spite 	 	the	evidence	.
No	one	can	say	that	the	 plant 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	eat	an	animal	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	against	the	order	of	nature	.
But	 plant 	 s 	 	are	 al 	 so 	 	able	to	show	a	lot	of	 move 	 ment 	 	.
Some	of	them	are	 ver 	 y 	 	well	known	,	like	the	 flower 	 ing 	 	.
It	's	just	a	question	to	use	some	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	like	the	time	lapse	.
Some	of	them	are	much	more	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	.
Look	at	 th 	 is 	 	young	bean	that	is	moving	to	catch	the	light	every	time	.
And	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	so	 grace 	 ful 	 	;	it	's	like	a	 danc 	 ing 	 	angel	.
 The 	 y 	 	are	 al 	 so 	 	able	to	play	--	they	are	 re 	 ally 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	young	 s 	 un 	 flower 	 s 	 	,	and	what	they	are	 do 	 ing 	 	can	not	be	 de 	 scribed 	 	with	any	other	 term 	 s 	 	than	 play 	 ing 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	are	training	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	young	 animal 	 s 	 	do	,	to	the	adult	life	where	they	will	be	 call 	 ed 	 	to	track	the	 s 	 un 	 	all	the	day	.
 The 	 y 	 	are	able	to	respond	to	 gravit 	 y 	 	,	of	course	,	so	the	 shoot 	 s 	 	are	growing	against	the	vector	of	 gravit 	 y 	 	and	the	 root 	 s 	 	 to 	 ward 	 	the	vector	of	 gravit 	 y 	 	.
But	they	are	 al 	 so 	 	able	to	sleep	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	one	,	Mimosa	 pu 	 dica 	 	.
So	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	night	,	they	curl	the	 leav 	 es 	 	and	 reduc 	 e 	 	the	 move 	 ment 	 	,	and	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	day	,	you	have	the	 open 	 ing 	 	of	the	 leav 	 es 	 	--	there	is	much	more	 move 	 ment 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 interest 	 ing 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 sleep 	 ing 	 	 machine 	 ry 	 	,	it	's	 perfect 	 ly 	 	 conserv 	 ed 	 	.
It	's	the	same	in	 plant 	 s 	 	,	in	 insect 	 s 	 	and	in	 animal 	 s 	 	.
And	so	if	you	need	to	 stud 	 y 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 sleep 	 ing 	 	problem	,	it	's	easy	to	 stud 	 y 	 	on	 plant 	 s 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	than	in	 animal 	 s 	 	and	it	's	much	more	easy	even	 ethic 	 ally 	 	.
It	's	a	kind	of	 veget 	 arian 	 	 experiment 	 ation 	 	.
 Plan 	 ts 	 	are	even	able	to	communicate	--	they	are	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 communicator 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	communicate	with	other	 plant 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	are	able	to	distinguish	kin	and	 non 	 - 	 kin 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	communicate	with	 plant 	 s 	 	of	other	species	and	they	communicate	with	 animal 	 s 	 	by	producing	chemical	 volatil 	 es 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	 pollinat 	 ion 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	with	the	 pollinat 	 ion 	 	,	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	serious	issue	for	 plant 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	move	the	 poll 	 en 	 	from	one	flower	to	the	other	,	yet	they	can	not	move	from	one	flower	to	the	other	.
So	they	need	a	vector	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	vector	,	it	's	 normal 	 ly 	 	an	animal	.
 Man 	 y 	 	 insect 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	used	by	 plant 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 vector 	 s 	 	for	the	transport	of	the	 pollinat 	 ion 	 	,	but	not	just	 insect 	 s 	 	;	even	 bird 	 s 	 	,	 reptil 	 es 	 	,	and	 mammal 	 s 	 	like	 bat 	 s 	 	 rat 	 s 	 	are	 normal 	 ly 	 	used	for	the	 transport 	 ation 	 	of	the	 poll 	 en 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	serious	business	.
We	have	the	 plant 	 s 	 	that	are	giving	to	the	 animal 	 s 	 	a	kind	of	sweet	 sub 	 stance 	 	--	 ver 	 y 	 	 energ 	 izing 	 	--	 hav 	 ing 	 	in	change	 th 	 is 	 	 transport 	 ation 	 	of	the	 poll 	 en 	 	.
But	some	 plant 	 s 	 	are	 manipul 	 ating 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	,	like	in	the	case	of	 orchid 	 s 	 	that	promise	 s 	 ex 	 	and	nectar	and	give	in	change	 noth 	 ing 	 	for	the	 transport 	 ation 	 	of	the	 poll 	 en 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	there	is	a	big	problem	 be 	 hind 	 	all	 th 	 is 	 	behavior	that	we	have	 s 	 een 	 	.
How	is	it	possible	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	 with 	 out 	 	a	brain	?
We	need	to	wait	 un 	 til 	 	1880	,	when	 th 	 is 	 	big	man	,	 Char 	 les 	 	Darwin	,	 publish 	 es 	 	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	,	 astonish 	 ing 	 	book	that	 start 	 s 	 	a	revolution	.
The	title	is	``	The	Power	of	 Move 	 ment 	 	in	 Plan 	 ts 	 	.	''
No	one	was	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	speak	about	 move 	 ment 	 	in	 plant 	 s 	 	before	 Char 	 les 	 	Darwin	.
In	his	book	,	 assist 	 ed 	 	by	his	son	,	Francis	--	who	was	the	first	professor	of	plant	physiology	in	the	world	,	in	 Cam 	 bridge 	 	--	they	took	 in 	 to 	 	 consider 	 ation 	 	every	single	 move 	 ment 	 	for	500	 page 	 s 	 	.
And	in	the	last	 para 	 graph 	 	of	the	book	,	it	's	a	kind	of	 styl 	 istic 	 	mark	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 normal 	 ly 	 	 Char 	 les 	 	Darwin	 store 	 d 	 	,	in	the	last	 para 	 graph 	 	of	a	book	,	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	 mess 	 age 	 	.
He	wrote	that	,	``	It	's	 hard 	 ly 	 	an	 exagge 	 ration 	 	to	say	that	the	tip	of	the	radical	 act 	 s 	 	like	the	brain	of	one	of	the	lower	 animal 	 s 	 	.	''
 Th 	 is 	 	is	not	a	metaphor	.
He	wrote	some	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 letter 	 s 	 	to	one	of	his	 friend 	 s 	 	who	was	 J. 	 D 	 	.	 Hook 	 er 	 	,	or	at	that	time	,	 p 	 resident 	 	of	the	 Ro 	 y 	 al 	 	 Socie 	 ty 	 	,	so	the	 maxim 	 um 	 	scientific	 author 	 ity 	 	in	 Brit 	 ain 	 	 s 	 peaking 	 	about	the	brain	in	the	 plant 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	root	 ap 	 ex 	 	growing	against	a	 slop 	 e 	 	.
So	you	can	 recogn 	 ize 	 	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 move 	 ment 	 	,	the	same	 move 	 ment 	 	that	 worm 	 s 	 	,	 snake 	 s 	 	and	every	animal	that	are	moving	on	the	ground	 with 	 out 	 	 leg 	 s 	 	is	able	to	 dis 	 play 	 	.
And	it	's	not	an	easy	 move 	 ment 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	,	to	have	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 move 	 ment 	 	,	you	need	to	move	different	 region 	 s 	 	of	the	root	and	to	 synchron 	 ize 	 	these	different	 region 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	brain	.
So	we	 stud 	 ied 	 	the	root	 ap 	 ex 	 	and	we	found	that	there	is	a	specific	region	that	is	here	,	 depict 	 ed 	 	in	blue	--	that	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	``	 transit 	 ion 	 	zone	.	''
And	 th 	 is 	 	region	,	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	small	region	--	it	's	less	than	one	millimeter	.
And	in	 th 	 is 	 	small	region	you	have	the	highest	consumption	of	oxygen	in	the	 plant 	 s 	 	and	more	 import 	 ant 	 	,	you	have	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 signal 	 s 	 	here	.
The	 signal 	 s 	 	that	you	are	 see 	 ing 	 	here	are	action	potential	,	are	the	same	 signal 	 s 	 	that	the	 neuro 	 ns 	 	of	my	brain	,	of	our	brain	,	use	to	 ex 	 change 	 	information	.
 N 	 ow 	 	we	know	that	a	root	 ap 	 ex 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	just	a	few	hundred	 cell 	 s 	 	that	show	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	feature	,	but	we	know	how	big	the	root	apparatus	of	a	small	plant	,	like	a	plant	of	 ry 	 e 	 	.
We	have	 al 	 most 	 	14	million	 root 	 s 	 	.
We	have	11	and	a	half	million	root	 ap 	 ex 	 	and	a	total	length	of	600	or	more	 kilometer 	 s 	 	and	a	 ver 	 y 	 	high	surface	area	.
 N 	 ow 	 	let	's	imagine	that	each	single	root	 ap 	 ex 	 	is	 work 	 ing 	 	in	network	with	all	the	 other 	 s 	 	.
 He 	 re 	 	 we 	 re 	 	have	on	the	left	,	the	Internet	and	on	the	right	,	the	root	apparatus	.
 The 	 y 	 	work	in	the	same	way	.
 The 	 y 	 	are	a	network	of	small	computing	 machine 	 s 	 	,	 work 	 ing 	 	in	 network 	 s 	 	.
And	why	are	they	so	similar	?
 Be 	 cause 	 	they	 evolv 	 ed 	 	for	the	same	reason	:	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	 pre 	 d 	 ation 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	work	in	the	same	way	.
So	you	can	 re 	 move 	 	90	percent	of	the	root	apparatus	and	the	 plant 	 s 	 	[	 continu 	 e 	 	]	to	work	.
You	can	 re 	 move 	 	90	percent	of	the	Internet	and	it	is	[	 continu 	 ing 	 	]	to	work	.
So	,	a	 suggest 	 ion 	 	for	the	people	 work 	 ing 	 	with	 network 	 s 	 	:	 plant 	 s 	 	are	able	to	give	you	good	 suggest 	 ions 	 	about	how	to	evolve	 network 	 s 	 	.
And	 an 	 other 	 	 possibil 	 ity 	 	is	a	 techno 	 logical 	 	 possibil 	 ity 	 	.
Let	's	imagine	that	we	can	build	 robot 	 s 	 	and	 robot 	 s 	 	that	are	inspired	by	 plant 	 s 	 	.
 Un 	 til 	 	now	,	the	man	was	inspired	just	by	man	or	the	 animal 	 s 	 	in	producing	a	robot	.
We	have	the	 animal 	 oid 	 	--	and	the	normal	 robot 	 s 	 	inspired	by	 animal 	 s 	 	,	 insect 	 oid 	 	,	so	on	.
We	have	the	 and 	 roid 	 s 	 	that	are	inspired	by	man	.
But	why	have	we	not	any	 plant 	 oid 	 	?
Well	,	if	you	want	to	fly	,	it	's	good	that	you	look	at	 bird 	 s 	 	--	to	be	inspired	by	 bird 	 s 	 	.
But	if	you	want	to	explore	 s 	 oil 	 s 	 	,	or	if	you	want	to	 colon 	 ize 	 	new	 territ 	 ory 	 	,	to	best	thing	that	you	can	do	is	to	be	inspired	by	 plant 	 s 	 	that	are	 master 	 s 	 	in	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
We	have	 an 	 other 	 	 possibil 	 ity 	 	we	are	 work 	 ing 	 	[	on	]	in	our	lab	,	[	which	]	is	to	build	 hybrid 	 s 	 	.
It	's	much	more	easy	to	build	 hybrid 	 s 	 	.
 Hy 	 brid 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	half	living	and	half	machine	.
It	's	much	more	easy	to	work	with	 plant 	 s 	 	than	with	 animal 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	have	computing	power	,	they	have	 electric 	 al 	 	 signal 	 s 	 	.
The	 connect 	 ion 	 	with	the	machine	is	much	more	easy	,	much	more	even	 ethic 	 ally 	 	possible	.
And	these	are	three	 possibil 	 ities 	 	that	we	are	 work 	 ing 	 	on	to	build	 hybrid 	 s 	 	,	driven	by	 al 	 ga 	 e 	 	or	by	the	 leav 	 es 	 	at	the	end	,	by	the	most	,	most	 power 	 ful 	 	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	 plant 	 s 	 	,	by	the	 root 	 s 	 	.
Well	,	thank	you	for	your	attention	.
And	before	I	finish	,	I	would	like	to	 re 	 assure 	 	that	no	 s 	 nail 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 harm 	 ed 	 	in	making	 th 	 is 	 	 present 	 ation 	 	.
Thank	you	.

A	 whistl 	 eb 	 lower 	 	you	have	n't	heard
Thank	you	.
Thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
That	was	 whistl 	 ing 	 	.
I	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	in	English	.
What	is	a	 c 	 hub 	 by 	 	,	 cur 	 ly 	 - 	 haired 	 	guy	from	 Hol 	 land 	 	--	why	is	he	 whistl 	 ing 	 	?
Well	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	I	've	[	 be 	 en 	 	]	 whistl 	 ing 	 	since	the	age	of	four	,	about	four	.
My	dad	was	 al 	 ways 	 	 whistl 	 ing 	 	around	the	house	,	and	I	just	thought	that	's	part	of	communication	in	my	family	.
So	I	 whistl 	 ed 	 	 a 	 long 	 	with	him	.
And	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	till	I	was	34	,	I	 al 	 ways 	 	 annoy 	 ed 	 	and	 irrit 	 ated 	 	people	with	 whistl 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	to	be	honest	,	my	 whistl 	 ing 	 	is	a	kind	of	 de 	 vi 	 ant 	 	behavior	.
I	 whistl 	 ed 	 	 al 	 one 	 	.	I	 whistl 	 ed 	 	in	the	 class 	 room 	 	.
I	 whistl 	 ed 	 	on	[	my	]	bike	.	I	 whistl 	 ed 	 	 every 	 where 	 	.
And	I	 al 	 so 	 	 whistl 	 ed 	 	at	a	 Christ 	 ma 	 s 	 	Eve	party	with	my	 family 	 - 	 in 	 - 	 law 	 	.
And	they	had	some	,	in	my	opinion	,	 terr 	 ible 	 	 Christ 	 ma 	 s 	 	music	.
And	when	I	hear	music	that	I	do	n't	like	,	I	try	to	make	it	better	.
So	``	 Rud 	 olph 	 	the	 Red 	 - 	 No 	 s 	 ed 	 	 Re 	 in 	 de 	 er 	 	''	--	you	know	it	?
But	it	can	 al 	 so 	 	sound	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
But	 dur 	 ing 	 	a	 Christ 	 ma 	 s 	 	party	--	at	 d 	 inner 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	--	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 annoy 	 ing 	 	.
So	my	 sister 	 - 	 in 	 - 	 law 	 	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	a	few	 time 	 s 	 	,	``	 P 	 lease 	 	stop	 whistl 	 ing 	 	.	''
And	I	just	could	n't	.
And	at	one	point	--	and	I	had	some	wine	,	I	have	to	admit	that	--	at	one	point	I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	If	there	was	a	contest	,	I	would	join	.	''
And	two	 week 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	I	 receiv 	 ed 	 	a	text	 mess 	 age 	 	:	``	You	're	going	to	America	.	''
So	,	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	I	'm	going	to	America	.
I	would	love	to	,	but	why	?
So	I	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	her	up	,	of	course	.
She	 Google 	 d 	 	,	and	she	found	 th 	 is 	 	World	 Whi 	 st 	 ling 	 	 Champ 	 ion 	 ship 	 	in	America	,	of	course	.
She	did	n't	expect	me	to	go	there	.
And	I	would	have	lost	my	face	.
I	do	n't	know	if	that	's	correct	English	.
But	the	Dutch	people	here	will	understand	what	I	mean	.
I	lost	my	face	.
And	she	thought	,	``	He	will	never	go	there	.	''
But	 actual 	 ly 	 	I	did	.
So	I	went	to	 Louis 	 burg 	 	,	North	 Caro 	 lina 	 	,	 south 	 east 	 	 Unit 	 ed 	 	 Stat 	 es 	 	,	and	I	 enter 	 ed 	 	the	world	of	 whistl 	 ing 	 	.
And	I	 al 	 so 	 	 enter 	 ed 	 	the	world	 champion 	 ship 	 	,	and	I	won	there	in	2004	.
That	was	great	 f 	 un 	 	,	of	course	.
And	to	defend	my	title	--	like	judokas	do	and	 s 	 port 	 s 	 men 	 	--	I	thought	,	well	let	's	go	back	in	2005	,	and	I	won	 aga 	 in 	 	.
 Th 	 en 	 	I	could	n't	 particip 	 ate 	 	for	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	.
And	in	2008	I	 enter 	 ed 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	in	Japan	,	 To 	 kyo 	 	,	and	I	won	 aga 	 in 	 	.
So	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	now	is	I	'm	 stand 	 ing 	 	here	in	Rotterdam	,	in	the	 beaut 	 iful 	 	city	,	on	a	big	stage	,	and	I	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 whistl 	 ing 	 	.
And	 actual 	 ly 	 	I	earn	my	money	 whistl 	 ing 	 	at	the	moment	.
So	I	quit	my	day	job	 a 	 s 	 	a	nurse	.
And	I	try	to	live	my	dream	--	well	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	it	was	never	my	dream	,	but	it	 sound 	 s 	 	so	good	.
 Oka 	 y 	 	,	I	'm	not	the	 on 	 ly 	 	one	 whistl 	 ing 	 	here	.
You	say	,	``	 Hu 	 h 	 	,	what	do	you	mean	?	''
Well	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	you	are	going	to	 whistl 	 e 	 	 a 	 long 	 	.
And	then	 al 	 ways 	 	the	same	thing	 happen 	 s 	 	:	people	are	 watch 	 ing 	 	each	other	and	think	,	``	Oh	,	my	God	.
Why	?	Can	I	go	away	?	''
No	,	you	ca	n't	.
 Actu 	 ally 	 	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	.
The	track	that	I	will	 whistl 	 e 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	Fête	de	la	 Bell 	 e 	 	.	''
It	's	about	80	 minute 	 s 	 	long	.
No	,	no	,	no	.	It	's	four	 minute 	 s 	 	long	.
And	I	want	to	first	 rehears 	 e 	 	with	you	your	 whistl 	 ing 	 	.
So	I	 whistl 	 e 	 	the	tone	.
 So 	 rry 	 	.	I	 for 	 got 	 	one	thing	.
You	 whistl 	 e 	 	the	same	tone	 a 	 s 	 	me	.
I	heard	a	wide	 varie 	 ty 	 	of	 tone 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	promising	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	promising	.
I	'll	ask	the	 technician 	 s 	 	to	start	the	music	.
And	if	it	's	 start 	 ed 	 	,	I	just	point	where	you	 whistl 	 e 	 	 a 	 long 	 	,	and	we	will	see	what	 happen 	 s 	 	.
Oh	,	hah	.

 Char 	 lie 	 	 T 	 odd 	 	:	The	 share 	 d 	 	experience	of	 absurd 	 ity 	 
I	 start 	 ed 	 	Improv	 Every 	 where 	 	about	10	 year 	 s 	 	ago	when	I	 move 	 d 	 	to	New	York	City	with	an	interest	in	 act 	 ing 	 	and	 come 	 dy 	 	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	I	was	new	to	the	city	,	I	did	n't	have	access	to	a	stage	,	so	I	 decide 	 d 	 	to	create	my	own	in	public	 place 	 s 	 	.
So	the	first	project	we	're	going	to	take	a	look	at	is	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	No	 P 	 ants 	 	 Sub 	 way 	 	Ride	.
 N 	 ow 	 	 th 	 is 	 	took	place	in	 Jan 	 uary 	 	of	2002	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	woman	is	the	star	of	the	video	.
She	 do 	 es 	 	n't	know	she	's	 be 	 ing 	 	 film 	 ed 	 	.
She	's	 be 	 ing 	 	 film 	 ed 	 	with	a	 hid 	 den 	 	camera	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	on	the	6	train	in	New	York	City	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	stop	 a 	 long 	 	the	line	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	two	 Dan 	 ish 	 	 guy 	 s 	 	who	come	out	and	 s 	 it 	 	down	next	to	the	 hid 	 den 	 	camera	.
And	that	's	me	right	there	in	a	 brow 	 n 	 	coat	.
It	's	about	30	 degree 	 s 	 	 out 	 side 	 	.
I	'm	 wear 	 ing 	 	a	hat	.	I	'm	 wear 	 ing 	 	a	 scar 	 f 	 	.
And	the	girl	's	going	to	notice	me	right	here	.
And	 a 	 s 	 	you	'll	see	now	,	I	'm	not	 wear 	 ing 	 	pants	.
So	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	--	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	she	's	 notice 	 d 	 	me	,	but	in	New	York	there	's	 weird 	 os 	 	on	any	 give 	 n 	 	train	car	.
One	person	's	not	that	 un 	 usual 	 	.
She	 go 	 es 	 	back	to	 read 	 ing 	 	her	book	,	which	is	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	titled	``	 Rap 	 e 	 	.	''
So	she	's	 notice 	 d 	 	the	 un 	 usual 	 	thing	,	but	she	's	gone	back	to	her	normal	life	.
 N 	 ow 	 	in	the	 mean 	 time 	 	,	I	have	six	 friend 	 s 	 	who	are	 wait 	 ing 	 	at	the	next	six	 con 	 s 	 ecutive 	 	 stop 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 under 	 wear 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	going	to	be	 enter 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	car	one	by	one	.
We	'll	act	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	we	do	n't	know	each	other	.
And	we	'll	act	 a 	 s 	 	if	it	's	just	an	 un 	 fortunate 	 	 mistak 	 e 	 	we	've	made	,	 forget 	 ting 	 	our	pants	on	 th 	 is 	 	cold	 Jan 	 uary 	 	day	.
So	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	,	she	 decide 	 s 	 	to	put	the	rape	book	away	.
And	she	 decide 	 s 	 	to	be	a	little	bit	more	aware	of	her	 surround 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	in	the	 mean 	 time 	 	,	the	two	 Dan 	 ish 	 	 guy 	 s 	 	to	the	left	of	the	camera	,	they	're	 crack 	 ing 	 	up	.
 The 	 y 	 	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 funni 	 est 	 	thing	they	've	ever	 s 	 een 	 	before	.
And	watch	her	make	eye	contact	with	them	right	about	now	.
And	I	love	that	moment	in	 th 	 is 	 	video	,	 be 	 cause 	 	before	it	 be 	 came 	 	a	 share 	 d 	 	experience	,	it	was	 some 	 thing 	 	that	was	 may 	 be 	 	a	little	bit	 scar 	 y 	 	,	or	 some 	 thing 	 	that	was	at	 l 	 east 	 	 con 	 fusing 	 	to	her	.
And	then	once	it	 be 	 came 	 	a	 share 	 d 	 	experience	,	it	was	funny	and	 some 	 thing 	 	that	she	could	laugh	at	.
So	the	train	is	now	 pull 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	third	stop	 a 	 long 	 	the	6	line	.
So	the	video	wo	n't	show	 every 	 thing 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 go 	 es 	 	on	for	 an 	 other 	 	four	 stop 	 s 	 	.
A	total	of	seven	 guy 	 s 	 	enter	 anonym 	 ously 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 under 	 wear 	 	.
At	the	eighth	stop	,	a	girl	came	in	with	a	giant	duffel	bag	and	 announce 	 d 	 	she	had	pants	for	sale	for	a	dollar	--	like	you	might	sell	 batt 	 eries 	 	or	 can 	 dy 	 	on	the	train	.
We	all	 ver 	 y 	 	matter	of	 fact 	 ly 	 	 b 	 ought 	 	a	pair	of	pants	,	put	them	on	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Thank	you	.	That	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	I	 need 	 ed 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	''	and	then	 exit 	 ed 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 reveal 	 ing 	 	what	had	 happen 	 ed 	 	and	went	in	all	different	 direction 	 s 	 	.
Thank	you	.
So	that	's	a	still	from	the	video	there	.
And	I	love	that	girl	's	 re 	 action 	 	so	much	.
And	 watch 	 ing 	 	that	 video 	 tape 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	that	day	inspired	me	to	keep	 do 	 ing 	 	what	I	do	.
And	 re 	 ally 	 	one	of	the	 point 	 s 	 	of	Improv	 Every 	 where 	 	is	to	cause	a	scene	in	a	public	place	that	is	a	positive	experience	for	other	people	.
It	's	a	 p 	 rank 	 	,	but	it	's	a	 p 	 rank 	 	that	 give 	 s 	 	 some 	 body 	 	a	great	story	to	tell	.
And	her	 re 	 action 	 	inspired	me	to	do	a	second	annual	No	 P 	 ants 	 	 Sub 	 way 	 	Ride	.
And	we	've	 continu 	 ed 	 	to	do	it	every	year	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 Jan 	 uary 	 	,	we	did	the	10th	annual	No	 P 	 ants 	 	 Sub 	 way 	 	Ride	where	a	 divers 	 e 	 	group	of	3,500	people	 rod 	 e 	 	the	train	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 under 	 wear 	 	in	New	York	--	 al 	 most 	 	every	single	train	line	in	the	city	.
And	 al 	 so 	 	in	50	other	cities	around	the	world	,	people	 particip 	 ated 	 	.
 A 	 s 	 	I	 start 	 ed 	 	taking	improv	class	at	the	 Up 	 right 	 	 Citizen 	 s 	 	Brigade	 Th 	 eater 	 	and	 meet 	 ing 	 	other	creative	people	and	other	 perform 	 ers 	 	and	 comedian 	 s 	 	,	I	 start 	 ed 	 	 a 	 mass 	 ing 	 	a	 mail 	 ing 	 	list	of	people	who	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	these	 type 	 s 	 	of	 project 	 s 	 	.
So	I	could	do	more	 large 	 - 	 scale 	 	 project 	 s 	 	.
Well	one	day	I	was	 walk 	 ing 	 	through	 Un 	 ion 	 	Square	,	and	I	saw	 th 	 is 	 	building	,	which	had	just	 be 	 en 	 	built	in	2005	.
And	there	was	a	girl	in	one	of	the	 window 	 s 	 	and	she	was	 danc 	 ing 	 	.
And	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	peculiar	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	dark	out	,	but	she	was	 back 	 - 	 lit 	 	with	 flor 	 escent 	 	 light 	 ing 	 	,	and	she	was	 ver 	 y 	 	much	 on 	 stage 	 	,	and	I	could	n't	figure	out	why	she	was	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
After	about	15	 second 	 s 	 	,	her	friend	 appear 	 ed 	 	--	she	had	 be 	 en 	 	 hid 	 ing 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	a	 dis 	 play 	 	--	and	they	 laugh 	 ed 	 	and	 hugg 	 ed 	 	each	other	and	ran	away	.
So	it	 seem 	 ed 	 	like	 may 	 be 	 	she	had	 be 	 en 	 	 da 	 red 	 	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
So	I	got	inspired	by	that	.
 Look 	 ing 	 	at	the	entire	facade	--	there	 we 	 re 	 	70	total	 window 	 s 	 	--	and	I	 k 	 new 	 	what	I	had	to	do	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	project	is	 call 	 ed 	 	Look	Up	 Mo 	 re 	 	.	We	had	70	 act 	 ors 	 	dress	in	black	.
 Th 	 is 	 	was	 complete 	 ly 	 	 un 	 author 	 ized 	 	.
We	did	n't	let	the	 store 	 s 	 	know	we	 we 	 re 	 	coming	.
And	I	stood	in	the	park	giving	 signal 	 s 	 	.
The	first	signal	was	for	 every 	 body 	 	to	hold	up	these	 four 	 - 	 foot 	 	tall	 letter 	 s 	 	that	 spell 	 ed 	 	out	``	Look	Up	 Mo 	 re 	 	,	''	the	name	of	the	project	.
The	second	signal	was	for	 every 	 body 	 	to	do	 J 	 ump 	 ing 	 	 jack 	 s 	 	together	.
You	'll	see	that	start	right	here	.
And	then	we	had	 danc 	 ing 	 	.	We	had	 every 	 one 	 	dance	.
And	then	we	had	dance	 s 	 olo 	 s 	 	where	 on 	 ly 	 	one	person	would	dance	and	 every 	 body 	 	would	point	to	them	.
So	then	I	 g 	 ave 	 	a	new	hand	signal	,	which	 signal 	 ed 	 	the	next	 s 	 olo 	 ist 	 	down	 be 	 low 	 	in	 For 	 ever 	 	21	,	and	he	 danc 	 ed 	 	.
There	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	other	 activ 	 ities 	 	.
We	had	people	 jump 	 ing 	 	up	and	down	,	people	dropping	to	the	ground	.
And	I	was	 stand 	 ing 	 	just	 anonym 	 ously 	 	in	a	 sweat 	 shirt 	 	,	 put 	 ting 	 	my	hand	on	and	off	of	a	 trash 	 can 	 	to	signal	the	 advance 	 ment 	 	.
And	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	in	 Un 	 ion 	 	Square	Park	,	right	by	a	 sub 	 way 	 	station	,	there	 we 	 re 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	people	by	the	end	who	 stop 	 ped 	 	and	 look 	 ed 	 	up	and	 watch 	 ed 	 	what	we	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	.
There	's	a	better	photo	of	it	.
So	that	 part 	 icular 	 	event	was	inspired	by	a	moment	that	I	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	 s 	 tumble 	 	 up 	 on 	 	.
The	next	project	I	want	to	show	was	 give 	 n 	 	to	me	in	an	email	from	a	 strange 	 r 	 	.
A	high	school	kid	in	Texas	wrote	me	in	2006	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	You	should	get	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	people	 a 	 s 	 	possible	to	put	on	blue	polo	 shirt 	 s 	 	and	 kh 	 aki 	 	pants	and	go	 in 	 to 	 	a	 B 	 est 	 	Buy	and	stand	around	.	''
So	I	wrote	 th 	 is 	 	high	school	kid	back	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	,	and	I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Yes	,	you	are	correct	.
I	think	I	'll	try	to	do	that	 th 	 is 	 	 week 	 end 	 	.	Thank	you	.	''
So	here	's	the	video	.
So	 aga 	 in 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	2005	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	 B 	 est 	 	Buy	in	New	York	City	.
We	had	about	80	people	show	up	to	 particip 	 ate 	 	,	 enter 	 ing 	 	 one 	 - 	 by 	 - 	 one 	 	.
There	was	an	eight	 year 	 - 	 old 	 	girl	,	a	10	 year 	 - 	 old 	 	girl	.
There	was	 al 	 so 	 	a	65	 year 	 - 	 old 	 	man	who	 particip 	 ated 	 	.
So	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 divers 	 e 	 	group	of	people	.
And	I	told	people	,	``	Do	n't	work	.	Do	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	work	.
But	 al 	 so 	 	,	do	n't	shop	.
Just	stand	around	and	do	n't	face	 product 	 s 	 	.	''
 N 	 ow 	 	you	can	see	the	regular	 employ 	 ees 	 	by	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	have	the	yellow	 tag 	 s 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	shirt	.
 Every 	 body 	 	else	is	one	of	our	 act 	 ors 	 	.
The	lower	level	 employ 	 ees 	 	thought	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	funny	.
And	in	fact	,	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	of	them	went	to	go	get	 the 	 ir 	 	camera	from	the	break	room	and	took	 photo 	 s 	 	with	us	.
A	lot	of	them	made	 joke 	 s 	 	about	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	us	to	go	to	the	back	to	get	heavy	 tele 	 vision 	 	 set 	 s 	 	for	 custom 	 ers 	 	.
The	 manage 	 rs 	 	and	the	security	 guard 	 s 	 	,	on	the	other	hand	,	did	not	find	it	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	funny	.
You	can	see	them	in	 th 	 is 	 	 foot 	 age 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	 wear 	 ing 	 	either	a	yellow	shirt	or	a	black	shirt	.
And	we	 we 	 re 	 	there	 prob 	 ably 	 	10	 minute 	 s 	 	before	the	 manage 	 rs 	 	 decide 	 d 	 	to	dial	911	.
So	they	 start 	 ed 	 	running	around	 tell 	 ing 	 	 every 	 body 	 	the	 cop 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	coming	,	watch	out	,	the	 cop 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	coming	.
And	you	can	see	the	 cop 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 foot 	 age 	 	right	here	.
That	's	a	cop	 wear 	 ing 	 	black	right	there	,	 be 	 ing 	 	 film 	 ed 	 	with	a	 hid 	 den 	 	camera	.
 Ulti 	 mate 	 ly 	 	,	the	police	had	to	inform	 B 	 est 	 	Buy	management	that	it	was	not	,	in	fact	,	 il 	 legal 	 	to	wear	a	blue	polo	shirt	and	 kh 	 aki 	 	pants	.
Thank	you	.
So	we	had	 be 	 en 	 	there	for	20	 minute 	 s 	 	;	we	 we 	 re 	 	happy	to	exit	the	store	.
One	thing	the	 manage 	 rs 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	was	to	track	down	our	 camera 	 s 	 	.
And	they	caught	a	couple	of	my	 guy 	 s 	 	who	had	 hid 	 den 	 	 camera 	 s 	 	in	duffel	 bag 	 s 	 	.
But	the	one	camera	guy	they	never	caught	was	the	guy	that	went	in	just	with	a	blank	tape	and	went	over	to	the	 B 	 est 	 	Buy	camera	 depart 	 ment 	 	and	just	put	his	tape	in	one	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 camera 	 s 	 	and	 pretend 	 ed 	 	to	shop	.
So	I	like	that	 con 	 cept 	 	of	using	 the 	 ir 	 	own	technology	against	them	.
I	think	our	best	 project 	 s 	 	are	 one 	 s 	 	that	are	 s 	 ite 	 	specific	and	happen	at	a	 part 	 icular 	 	place	for	a	reason	.
And	one	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	I	was	 rid 	 ing 	 	the	 sub 	 way 	 	.
I	had	to	make	a	transfer	at	the	53rd	 St 	 . 	 	stop	where	there	are	these	two	giant	 escal 	 ators 	 	.
And	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 depress 	 ing 	 	place	to	be	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 crowd 	 ed 	 	.
So	I	 decide 	 d 	 	to	try	and	stage	 some 	 thing 	 	that	could	make	it	 a 	 s 	 	happy	 a 	 s 	 	possible	for	one	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	was	in	the	winter	of	2009	--	8:30	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
It	's	 morn 	 ing 	 	rush	hour	.
It	's	 ver 	 y 	 	cold	 out 	 side 	 	.
People	are	coming	in	from	 Queen 	 s 	 	,	 transfer 	 ring 	 	from	the	E	train	to	the	6	train	.
And	they	're	going	up	these	giant	 escal 	 ators 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	way	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 job 	 s 	 	.
Thank	you	.
So	there	's	a	photograph	that	 illustr 	 ates 	 	it	a	little	bit	better	.
He	 g 	 ave 	 	2,000	high	 five 	 s 	 	that	day	,	and	he	 wash 	 ed 	 	his	 hand 	 s 	 	before	and	 after 	 ward 	 	and	did	not	get	sick	.
And	that	was	 d 	 one 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 per 	 mission 	 	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	no	one	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	care	.
So	I	'd	say	over	the	 year 	 s 	 	,	one	of	the	most	common	 critic 	 ism 	 s 	 	I	see	of	Improv	 Every 	 where 	 	left	 anonym 	 ously 	 	on	YouTube	 comment 	 s 	 	is	:	``	 Th 	 ese 	 	people	have	too	much	time	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	.	''
And	you	know	,	not	 every 	 body 	 	's	going	to	like	 every 	 thing 	 	you	do	,	and	I	've	 certain 	 ly 	 	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	thick	skin	 thank 	 s 	 	to	Internet	 comment 	 s 	 	,	but	that	one	's	 al 	 ways 	 	 both 	 er 	 ed 	 	me	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	do	n't	have	too	much	time	on	our	 hand 	 s 	 	.
The	 particip 	 ants 	 	at	Improv	 Every 	 where 	 	 event 	 s 	 	have	just	 a 	 s 	 	much	leisure	time	 a 	 s 	 	any	other	New	 York 	 ers 	 	,	they	just	 occasion 	 ally 	 	 choos 	 e 	 	to	 s 	 pend 	 	it	in	an	 un 	 usual 	 	way	.
You	know	,	every	Saturday	and	 Sun 	 day 	 	,	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	each	fall	gather	in	 foot 	 ball 	 	 stad 	 ium 	 s 	 	to	watch	 game 	 s 	 	.
And	I	've	never	 s 	 een 	 	 any 	 body 	 	comment	,	looking	at	a	 foot 	 ball 	 	game	,	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	All	 t 	 hose 	 	people	in	the	 stand 	 s 	 	,	they	have	too	much	time	on	 the 	 ir 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	.	''
And	of	course	they	do	n't	.
It	's	a	 perfect 	 ly 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	way	to	 s 	 pent 	 	a	 week 	 end 	 	afternoon	,	 watch 	 ing 	 	a	 foot 	 ball 	 	game	in	a	 stad 	 ium 	 	.
But	I	think	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	 perfect 	 ly 	 	valid	way	to	 s 	 pend 	 	an	afternoon	freezing	in	place	with	200	people	in	the	Grand	 Cent 	 ral 	 	terminal	or	 dress 	 ing 	 	up	like	a	 ghost 	 buster 	 	and	running	through	the	New	York	 Pub 	 lic 	 	 Libra 	 ry 	 	.
Or	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	the	same	 MP 	 3 	 	 a 	 s 	 	3,000	other	people	and	 danc 	 ing 	 	 silent 	 ly 	 	in	a	park	,	or	 burst 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	song	in	a	 grocer 	 y 	 	store	 a 	 s 	 	part	of	a	 spontane 	 ous 	 	musical	,	or	 div 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	ocean	in	 Con 	 ey 	 	Island	 wear 	 ing 	 	 form 	 al 	 	attire	.
You	know	,	 a 	 s 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	,	we	're	taught	to	play	.
And	we	're	never	 give 	 n 	 	a	reason	why	we	should	play	.
It	's	just	 accept 	 able 	 	that	play	is	a	good	thing	.
And	I	think	that	's	sort	of	the	point	of	Improv	 Every 	 where 	 	.
It	's	that	there	is	no	point	and	that	there	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	to	be	a	point	.
We	do	n't	need	a	reason	.
 A 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	it	's	 f 	 un 	 	and	it	 seem 	 s 	 	like	it	's	going	to	be	a	funny	idea	and	it	 seem 	 s 	 	like	the	people	who	witness	it	will	 al 	 so 	 	have	a	 f 	 un 	 	time	,	then	that	's	 en 	 ough 	 	for	us	.
And	I	think	,	 a 	 s 	 	 adult 	 s 	 	,	we	need	to	learn	that	there	's	no	right	or	wrong	way	to	play	.

Don	 Lev 	 y 	 	:	A	 cinema 	 tic 	 	journey	through	visual	 effect 	 s 	 
The	 film 	 maker 	 	 George 	 s 	 	Méliès	was	first	a	 magic 	 ian 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	 movie 	 s 	 	 prov 	 ed 	 	to	be	the	ultimate	medium	for	magic	.
With	complete	control	of	 every 	 thing 	 	the	audience	can	see	,	 movie 	 makers 	 	had	 develop 	 ed 	 	an	arsenal	of	 techni 	 que 	 s 	 	to	further	 the 	 ir 	 	 de 	 ception 	 s 	 	.
 Mo 	 tion 	 	 picture 	 s 	 	are	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	an	illusion	of	life	,	 produce 	 d 	 	by	the	 sequent 	 ial 	 	 project 	 ion 	 	of	still	 frame 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 astonish 	 ed 	 	the	 Lu 	 mière 	 	 brother 	 s 	 	'	early	 audience 	 s 	 	.
Even	 to 	 day 	 	's	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	 movie 	 go 	 ers 	 	still	lose	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	to	the	screen	,	and	 film 	 makers 	 	leverage	 th 	 is 	 	 separat 	 ion 	 	from	 re 	 ality 	 	to	great	effect	.
 N 	 ow 	 	 imagin 	 ative 	 	people	have	 be 	 en 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	 f 	 un 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	for	over	400	 year 	 s 	 	.
 G 	 iam 	 batt 	 ista 	 	 d 	 ella 	 	 Port 	 a 	 	,	a	 Ne 	 a 	 politan 	 	scholar	in	the	16th	century	,	 examine 	 d 	 	and	 stud 	 ied 	 	the	natural	world	and	saw	how	it	could	be	 manipul 	 ated 	 	.
 Play 	 ing 	 	with	the	world	,	and	our	 per 	 ception 	 	of	it	,	 re 	 ally 	 	is	the	 es 	 s 	 ence 	 	of	visual	 effect 	 s 	 	.
So	 dig 	 ging 	 	 deep 	 er 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	with	the	Science	and	 Techno 	 logy 	 	Council	of	the	Academy	of	 Mo 	 tion 	 	 Pic 	 ture 	 	 Art 	 s 	 	and	 Science 	 s 	 	 reveal 	 s 	 	some	truth	 be 	 hind 	 	the	 trick 	 ery 	 	.
Visual	 effect 	 s 	 	are	based	on	the	 principle 	 s 	 	of	all	 illusion 	 s 	 	:	assumption	,	 thing 	 s 	 	are	 a 	 s 	 	we	know	them	;	presumption	,	 thing 	 s 	 	will	 behav 	 e 	 	 a 	 s 	 	we	expect	;	and	 con 	 text 	 	in	 re 	 ality 	 	,	our	knowledge	of	the	world	 a 	 s 	 	we	know	it	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	scale	.
 N 	 ow 	 	a	fourth	factor	 re 	 ally 	 	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	an	obsession	,	which	is	,	never	betray	the	illusion	.
And	that	last	point	 ha 	 s 	 	made	visual	 effect 	 s 	 	a	constant	quest	for	 perfect 	 ion 	 	.
So	from	the	 hand 	 - 	 crank 	 ed 	 	jump	cut	early	 day 	 s 	 	of	cinema	to	last	 Sun 	 day 	 	's	Oscar	winner	,	what	 follow 	 s 	 	are	some	 step 	 s 	 	and	a	few	 repeat 	 s 	 	in	the	evolution	of	visual	 effect 	 s 	 	.

Dan	 Den 	 nett 	 	's	 respons 	 e 	 	to	Rick	 War 	 ren 	 
It	's	 wonder 	 ful 	 	to	be	back	.
I	love	 th 	 is 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 gather 	 ing 	 	.
And	you	must	be	 wonder 	 ing 	 	,	``	What	on	Earth	?
 Hav 	 e 	 	they	put	up	the	wrong	slide	?	''
No	,	no	.
Look	at	 th 	 is 	 	 magnific 	 ent 	 	beast	and	ask	the	question	--	who	designed	it	?
 Th 	 is 	 	is	TED	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 Techno 	 logy 	 	,	 Enter 	 tain 	 ment 	 	,	Design	and	there	's	a	 dai 	 ry 	 	cow	.
It	's	a	 quit 	 e 	 	 wonder 	 fully 	 	designed	animal	.
And	I	was	 think 	 ing 	 	,	how	do	I	 introduc 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	?
And	I	thought	,	well	,	 may 	 be 	 	that	old	 dog 	 ger 	 el 	 	by	 Jo 	 y 	 ce 	 	 Kil 	 mer 	 	,	you	know	:	``	Poems	are	made	by	 fool 	 s 	 	like	me	,	but	 on 	 ly 	 	God	can	make	a	tree	.	''
And	you	might	say	,	``	Well	,	God	designed	the	cow	.	''
But	,	of	course	,	God	got	a	lot	of	help	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	 ance 	 s 	 tor 	 	of	cattle	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	 Or 	 yx 	 	.
And	it	was	designed	by	natural	 s 	 election 	 	,	the	process	of	natural	 s 	 election 	 	,	over	 man 	 y 	 	 million 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
And	then	it	 be 	 came 	 	 domestic 	 ated 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
And	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	 be 	 came 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 steward 	 s 	 	,	and	,	 with 	 out 	 	even	 know 	 ing 	 	what	they	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	,	they	 gradu 	 ally 	 	 re 	 designed 	 	it	and	 re 	 designed 	 	it	and	 re 	 designed 	 	it	.
And	then	,	more	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	they	 re 	 ally 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	to	do	sort	of	reverse	 engineer 	 ing 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	beast	and	figure	out	just	what	the	 part 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	,	how	they	 work 	 ed 	 	and	how	they	might	be	 optimize 	 d 	 	--	how	they	might	be	made	better	.
 N 	 ow 	 	why	am	I	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 cow 	 s 	 	?
 Be 	 cause 	 	I	want	to	say	that	much	the	same	thing	is	true	of	 relig 	 ions 	 	.
 Religion 	 s 	 	are	natural	 phenomen 	 a 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	just	 a 	 s 	 	natural	 a 	 s 	 	 cow 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	have	 evolv 	 ed 	 	over	millennia	.
 The 	 y 	 	have	a	 bio 	 logical 	 	base	,	just	like	the	 Or 	 yx 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	have	 be 	 come 	 	 domestic 	 ated 	 	,	and	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 re 	 design 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 relig 	 ions 	 	for	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	TED	,	and	I	want	to	talk	about	design	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	what	I	've	 be 	 en 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	for	the	last	four	 year 	 s 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	since	the	first	time	you	saw	me	--	some	of	you	saw	me	at	TED	when	I	was	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	and	in	the	last	four	 year 	 s 	 	I	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	just	about	 non 	 - 	 stop 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	 top 	 ic 	 	.
And	you	might	say	it	's	about	the	reverse	 engineer 	 ing 	 	of	 relig 	 ions 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	that	 ver 	 y 	 	idea	,	I	think	,	 strike 	 s 	 	terror	in	 man 	 y 	 	people	,	or	anger	,	or	 anxie 	 ty 	 	of	one	sort	or	 an 	 other 	 	.
And	that	is	the	spell	that	I	want	to	break	.
I	want	to	say	,	no	,	 relig 	 ions 	 	are	an	 import 	 ant 	 	natural	 phenomen 	 on 	 	.
We	should	 stud 	 y 	 	them	with	the	same	 intens 	 ity 	 	that	we	 stud 	 y 	 	all	the	other	 import 	 ant 	 	natural	 phenomen 	 a 	 	,	like	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	heard	so	 eloquent 	 ly 	 	last	night	from	Al	 Go 	 re 	 	.
 To 	 day 	 	's	 relig 	 ions 	 	are	 brilli 	 ant 	 ly 	 	designed	--	 brilli 	 ant 	 ly 	 	designed	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	 immense 	 ly 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	social	 institution 	 s 	 	and	 man 	 y 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 feature 	 s 	 	can	be	 trac 	 ed 	 	back	to	 ear 	 lier 	 	 feature 	 s 	 	that	we	can	 re 	 ally 	 	make	sense	of	by	reverse	 engineer 	 ing 	 	.
And	,	 a 	 s 	 	with	the	cow	,	there	's	a	 mix 	 ture 	 	of	 evolution 	 ary 	 	design	,	designed	by	natural	 s 	 election 	 	 it 	 self 	 	,	and	intelligent	design	--	more	or	less	intelligent	design	--	and	 re 	 designed 	 	by	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	who	are	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 re 	 design 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 relig 	 ions 	 	.
You	do	n't	do	book	 talk 	 s 	 	at	TED	,	but	I	'm	going	to	have	just	one	slide	about	my	book	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	is	one	 mess 	 age 	 	in	it	which	I	think	 th 	 is 	 	group	 re 	 ally 	 	 need 	 s 	 	to	hear	.
And	I	would	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	to	get	your	 respons 	 es 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	.
It	's	the	one	policy	proposal	that	I	make	in	the	book	,	at	 th 	 is 	 	time	when	I	claim	not	to	know	 en 	 ough 	 	about	 relig 	 ion 	 	to	know	what	other	policy	 proposal 	 s 	 	to	make	.
And	it	's	one	that	 echo 	 es 	 	 remark 	 s 	 	that	you	've	heard	 al 	 ready 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
 He 	 re 	 	's	my	proposal	.
I	'm	going	to	just	take	a	couple	of	 minute 	 s 	 	to	explain	it	--	education	in	world	 relig 	 ions 	 	,	on	world	 relig 	 ions 	 	,	for	all	of	our	children	in	 prim 	 ary 	 	school	,	in	high	school	,	in	public	 school 	 s 	 	,	in	private	 school 	 s 	 	and	in	home	 school 	 ing 	 	.
So	what	I	'm	 pro 	 posing 	 	is	,	just	 a 	 s 	 	we	 requir 	 e 	 	 read 	 ing 	 	,	writing	,	arithmetic	,	American	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	so	we	should	have	a	curriculum	on	 fact 	 s 	 	about	all	the	 relig 	 ions 	 	of	the	world	--	about	 the 	 ir 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	about	 the 	 ir 	 	 cre 	 ed 	 s 	 	,	about	 the 	 ir 	 	 text 	 s 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	music	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 symbol 	 ism 	 s 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 prohibit 	 ions 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 requir 	 ement 	 s 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	should	be	 present 	 ed 	 	 factual 	 ly 	 	,	 straight 	 forward 	 ly 	 	,	with	no	 part 	 icular 	 	spin	,	to	all	of	the	children	in	the	country	.
And	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	you	teach	them	that	,	you	can	teach	them	 any 	 thing 	 	else	you	like	.
That	,	I	think	,	is	 maxim 	 al 	 	 toler 	 ance 	 	for	religious	 free 	 dom 	 	.
 A 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	you	inform	your	children	about	other	 relig 	 ions 	 	,	then	you	may	--	and	 a 	 s 	 	early	 a 	 s 	 	you	like	and	 what 	 ever 	 	you	like	--	teach	them	 what 	 ever 	 	 cre 	 ed 	 	you	want	them	to	learn	.
But	 al 	 so 	 	let	them	know	about	other	 relig 	 ions 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	why	do	I	say	that	?
 Be 	 cause 	 	 demo 	 cracy 	 	 depend 	 s 	 	on	an	 inform 	 ed 	 	 citizen 	 ship 	 	.
 In 	 form 	 ed 	 	consent	is	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 bed 	 rock 	 	of	our	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	 demo 	 cracy 	 	.
 Mi 	 s 	 inform 	 ed 	 	consent	is	not	worth	it	.
It	's	like	a	 co 	 in 	 	flip	;	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	count	 re 	 ally 	 	.
 Demo 	 cracy 	 	 depend 	 s 	 	on	 inform 	 ed 	 	consent	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	way	we	treat	people	 a 	 s 	 	 respons 	 ible 	 	 adult 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	children	 be 	 low 	 	the	age	of	consent	are	a	special	case	.
I	'm	going	to	use	a	word	that	 Past 	 or 	 	Rick	just	used	--	 parent 	 s 	 	are	 steward 	 s 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	children	.
 The 	 y 	 	do	n't	own	them	.
You	ca	n't	own	your	children	.
You	have	a	 respons 	 ibility 	 	to	the	world	,	to	the	state	,	to	them	,	to	take	care	of	them	right	.
You	may	teach	them	 what 	 ever 	 	 cre 	 ed 	 	you	think	is	most	 import 	 ant 	 	,	but	I	say	you	have	a	 respons 	 ibility 	 	to	let	them	be	 inform 	 ed 	 	about	all	the	other	 cre 	 ed 	 s 	 	in	the	world	,	too	.
The	reason	I	've	taken	 th 	 is 	 	time	is	I	've	 be 	 en 	 	 fascinate 	 d 	 	to	hear	some	of	the	 react 	 ions 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	.
One	 review 	 er 	 	for	a	 Ro 	 man 	 	Catholic	 news 	 paper 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	it	``	 total 	 itarian 	 	.	''
It	 strike 	 s 	 	me	 a 	 s 	 	 practical 	 ly 	 	libertarian	.
 I 	 s 	 	it	 total 	 itarian 	 	to	 requir 	 e 	 	 read 	 ing 	 	,	writing	and	arithmetic	?
I	do	n't	think	so	.
All	I	'm	 say 	 ing 	 	is	--	 fact 	 s 	 	.	 Fact 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	.
No	 value 	 s 	 	,	just	 fact 	 s 	 	about	all	the	world	's	 relig 	 ions 	 	.
 An 	 other 	 	 review 	 er 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	it	``	hilarious	.	''
Well	,	I	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 both 	 er 	 ed 	 	by	the	fact	that	 any 	 body 	 	would	think	that	was	hilarious	.
It	 seem 	 s 	 	to	me	to	be	 s 	 uch 	 	a	plausible	,	natural	 extens 	 ion 	 	of	the	 democrat 	 ic 	 	 principle 	 s 	 	we	 al 	 ready 	 	have	,	that	I	'm	 shock 	 ed 	 	to	think	 any 	 body 	 	would	find	that	just	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	.
I	know	 man 	 y 	 	 relig 	 ions 	 	are	so	 anx 	 ious 	 	about	 pre 	 serv 	 ing 	 	the	 pur 	 ity 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	faith	among	 the 	 ir 	 	children	that	they	are	intent	on	 keep 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	children	 ignor 	 ant 	 	of	other	 faith 	 s 	 	.
I	do	n't	think	that	's	 def 	 en 	 s 	 ible 	 	,	but	I	'd	 re 	 ally 	 	be	 pleas 	 ed 	 	to	get	your	 answer 	 s 	 	on	that	--	any	 react 	 ions 	 	to	that	--	 lat 	 er 	 	.
But	now	I	'm	going	to	move	on	.
Back	to	the	cow	.
 Th 	 is 	 	picture	,	which	I	 pull 	 ed 	 	off	the	web	--	the	fellow	on	the	left	is	 re 	 ally 	 	an	 import 	 ant 	 	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	picture	.
That	's	the	steward	.
 Cow 	 s 	 	could	n't	live	 with 	 out 	 	human	 steward 	 s 	 	--	they	're	 domestic 	 ated 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	a	sort	of	ectosymbiont	.
 The 	 y 	 	depend	on	us	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 surviv 	 al 	 	.
And	 Past 	 or 	 	Rick	was	just	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	sheep	.
I	'm	going	to	talk	about	sheep	,	too	.
There	's	a	lot	of	serendipitous	 converg 	 ence 	 	here	.
How	clever	it	was	of	sheep	to	 acquir 	 e 	 	 shepherd 	 s 	 	!
Think	of	what	 th 	 is 	 	got	them	.
 The 	 y 	 	could	 out 	 source 	 	all	 the 	 ir 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	--	 protect 	 ion 	 	from	 predator 	 s 	 	,	food	 find 	 ing 	 	,	health	maintenance	.
The	 on 	 ly 	 	cost	in	most	 flock 	 s 	 	is	a	loss	of	free	 mat 	 ing 	 	.
What	a	deal	.
``	How	clever	of	sheep	!	''	you	might	say	.
 Ex 	 cept 	 	,	of	course	,	it	was	n't	the	sheep	's	 clever 	 ness 	 	.
We	all	know	sheep	are	not	 exact 	 ly 	 	rocket	 scientist 	 s 	 	--	they	're	not	 ver 	 y 	 	smart	.
It	was	n't	the	 clever 	 ness 	 	of	the	sheep	at	all	.
 The 	 y 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 clue 	 less 	 	.
But	it	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	clever	move	.
 W 	 hose 	 	clever	move	was	it	?
It	was	a	clever	move	of	natural	 s 	 election 	 	 it 	 self 	 	.

 Les 	 lie 	 	 Or 	 gel 	 	is	still	a	 mole 	 cular 	 	biologist	,	 brilli 	 ant 	 	guy	,	and	 Or 	 gel 	 	's	Second	 Ru 	 le 	 	is	:	Evolution	is	 clever 	 er 	 	than	you	are	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	that	is	not	Intelligent	Design	--	not	from	Francis	 C 	 rick 	 	.
Evolution	is	 clever 	 er 	 	than	you	are	.
If	you	understand	 Or 	 gel 	 	's	Second	 Ru 	 le 	 	,	then	you	understand	why	the	Intelligent	Design	 move 	 ment 	 	is	 bas 	 ically 	 	a	hoax	.
The	 design 	 s 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	by	the	process	of	natural	 s 	 election 	 	are	 brilli 	 ant 	 	,	 un 	 believ 	 ably 	 	 brilli 	 ant 	 	.
 Aga 	 in 	 	and	 aga 	 in 	 	 biologist 	 s 	 	are	 fascinate 	 d 	 	with	the	 brilli 	 ance 	 	of	what	's	 discover 	 ed 	 	.
But	the	process	 it 	 self 	 	is	 with 	 out 	 	purpose	,	 with 	 out 	 	 fore 	 sight 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	design	.
When	I	was	here	four	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	I	told	the	story	about	an	ant	 climb 	 ing 	 	a	blade	of	grass	.
And	why	was	the	ant	 do 	 ing 	 	it	?
Well	,	it	's	 be 	 cause 	 	 it 	 s 	 	brain	had	 be 	 en 	 	 infect 	 ed 	 	with	a	 lance 	 t 	 	 flu 	 ke 	 	that	was	--	 need 	 ed 	 	to	get	 in 	 to 	 	the	 bel 	 ly 	 	of	a	sheep	or	a	cow	in	order	to	 re 	 produce 	 	.
It	was	sort	of	a	 s 	 pooky 	 	story	.
And	I	think	some	people	may	have	 mis 	 under 	 stood 	 	.
 L 	 ance 	 t 	 	 flu 	 ke 	 s 	 	are	n't	smart	.
I	submit	that	the	 intellig 	 ence 	 	of	a	 lance 	 t 	 	 flu 	 ke 	 	is	down	there	 some 	 where 	 	between	petunia	and	carrot	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	not	 re 	 ally 	 	bright	.	 The 	 y 	 	do	n't	have	to	be	.
The	 less 	 on 	 	we	learn	from	 th 	 is 	 	is	you	do	n't	have	to	have	a	mind	to	be	a	 benefici 	 ary 	 	.
The	design	is	there	in	nature	,	but	it	's	not	in	 any 	 body 	 	's	head	.
It	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	to	be	.
That	's	the	way	evolution	 work 	 s 	 	.
The	question	--	was	 domestic 	 ation 	 	good	for	sheep	?
It	was	great	for	 the 	 ir 	 	genetic	 fit 	 ness 	 	.
And	here	I	want	to	 re 	 mind 	 	you	of	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	point	that	Paul	 Mac 	 C 	 ready 	 	made	at	TED	three	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
 He 	 re 	 	's	what	he	 s 	 aid 	 	.
10,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	at	the	dawn	of	 agricultur 	 e 	 	,	human	population	,	plus	 live 	 stock 	 	and	 pet 	 s 	 	,	was	 approximate 	 ly 	 	a	tenth	of	one	per	cent	of	the	terrestrial	 vertebra 	 e 	 	 land 	 mass 	 	.
That	was	just	10,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
 Yes 	 ter 	 day 	 	,	in	 bio 	 logical 	 	 term 	 s 	 	.
What	is	it	 to 	 day 	 	?	 Do 	 es 	 	 any 	 body 	 	remember	what	he	told	us	?
98	percent	.
That	is	what	we	have	 d 	 one 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	I	 talk 	 ed 	 	to	Paul	 after 	 ward 	 s 	 	.
I	 want 	 ed 	 	to	check	to	find	out	how	he	'd	 calcul 	 ated 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	get	the	 source 	 s 	 	and	so	forth	.
And	he	 g 	 ave 	 	me	a	paper	that	he	had	written	on	 th 	 is 	 	.
There	was	a	 pass 	 age 	 	in	it	which	he	did	not	present	here	and	I	think	it	is	so	good	I	'm	going	to	read	it	to	you	.
``	Over	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	on	a	 un 	 ique 	 	sphere	,	chance	 ha 	 s 	 	 paint 	 ed 	 	a	thin	 cover 	 ing 	 	of	life	:	complex	,	 im 	 prob 	 able 	 	,	 wonder 	 ful 	 	and	fragile	.

We	heard	about	the	atmosphere	 a 	 s 	 	a	thin	layer	of	 var 	 nish 	 	.
Life	 it 	 self 	 	is	just	a	thin	coat	of	paint	on	 th 	 is 	 	planet	.
And	we	're	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	hold	the	 paint 	 brush 	 	.
And	how	can	we	do	that	?
The	key	to	our	 domin 	 ation 	 	of	the	planet	is	culture	,	and	the	key	to	culture	is	 relig 	 ion 	 	.
 Sup 	 pose 	 	 Mart 	 ian 	 	 scientist 	 s 	 	came	to	Earth	.
 The 	 y 	 	would	be	 puzzl 	 ed 	 	by	 man 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 Any 	 body 	 	know	what	 th 	 is 	 	is	?
I	'll	tell	you	what	it	is	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	million	people	 gather 	 ing 	 	on	the	 bank 	 s 	 	of	the	 Gan 	 ge 	 s 	 	in	2001	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	the	largest	single	 gather 	 ing 	 	of	human	 be 	 ing 	 s 	 	ever	,	 a 	 s 	 	 s 	 een 	 	from	satellite	photograph	.
 He 	 re 	 	's	a	big	crowd	.
 He 	 re 	 	's	 an 	 other 	 	crowd	in	Mecca	.
 Mart 	 ians 	 	would	be	 amaz 	 ed 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	'd	want	to	know	how	it	 origin 	 ated 	 	,	what	it	was	for	and	how	it	 perpetu 	 ates 	 	 it 	 self 	 	.
 Actu 	 ally 	 	,	I	'm	going	to	pass	over	 th 	 is 	 	.
The	ant	is	n't	 al 	 one 	 	.
There	's	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 case 	 s 	 	of	species	.
In	that	case	,	a	 parasit 	 e 	 	 get 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	mouse	and	it	 need 	 s 	 	to	get	 in 	 to 	 	the	 bel 	 ly 	 	of	a	cat	.
And	it	 turn 	 s 	 	the	mouse	 in 	 to 	 	 Might 	 y 	 	 Mo 	 use 	 	--	it	 make 	 s 	 	it	 fear 	 less 	 	,	so	it	 run 	 s 	 	out	in	the	open	,	where	it	'll	be	eaten	by	a	cat	.
 Tru 	 e 	 	story	.
In	other	 word 	 s 	 	,	we	have	these	 hijack 	 ers 	 	--	you	've	 s 	 een 	 	 th 	 is 	 	slide	before	,	from	four	 year 	 s 	 	ago	--	a	 parasit 	 e 	 	that	 infect 	 s 	 	the	brain	and	 induce 	 s 	 	even	 sui 	 cidal 	 	behavior	on	 be 	 half 	 	of	a	cause	other	than	one	's	own	genetic	 fit 	 ness 	 	.
 Do 	 es 	 	that	ever	happen	to	us	?
Yes	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	--	 quit 	 e 	 	 wonder 	 fully 	 	.
The	 Arab 	 ic 	 	word	``	Islam	''	 mean 	 s 	 	``	 sub 	 mission 	 	.	''
It	 mean 	 s 	 	``	surrender	of	 self 	 - 	 interest 	 	to	the	will	of	 A 	 llah 	 	.	''
But	I	'm	not	just	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	Islam	.
I	'm	 talk 	 ing 	 	 al 	 so 	 	about	 Christ 	 ian 	 ity 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	 par 	 ch 	 ment 	 	music	page	that	I	found	in	a	Paris	 book 	 stall 	 	50	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
And	on	it	it	 say 	 s 	 	,	in	 Lat 	 in 	 	:	``	 Se 	 men 	 	est	 verb 	 um 	 	 De 	 i 	 	.	 S 	 ator 	 	 aut 	 em 	 	 Christ 	 us 	 	.
The	word	of	God	is	the	seed	and	the	 s 	 ow 	 er 	 	of	the	seed	is	Christ	.	''
 Sam 	 e 	 	idea	!	Well	,	not	 quit 	 e 	 	.
But	in	fact	,	 Christ 	 ians 	 	,	too	,	 glor 	 y 	 	in	the	fact	that	they	have	 surrender 	 ed 	 	to	God	.
I	'll	give	you	a	few	 quote 	 s 	 	.
``	The	heart	of	worship	is	surrender	.
 Sur 	 render 	 ed 	 	people	obey	God	's	 word 	 s 	 	,	even	if	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	sense	.	''
 T 	 hose 	 	 word 	 s 	 	are	by	Rick	 War 	 ren 	 	.
 T 	 hose 	 	are	from	``	The	 Pur 	 pose 	 	 Driv 	 en 	 	Life	.	''
And	I	want	to	turn	now	,	 brief 	 ly 	 	,	to	talk	about	that	book	,	which	I	've	read	.
You	've	all	got	a	copy	.
You	've	just	heard	the	man	.
And	what	I	want	to	do	now	is	say	a	bit	about	 th 	 is 	 	book	from	the	design	 stand 	 point 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	I	think	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 brilli 	 ant 	 	book	.
First	of	all	,	the	goal	.
And	you	heard	just	now	what	the	goal	is	.
It	's	to	 br 	 ing 	 	purpose	to	the	 live 	 s 	 	of	 million 	 s 	 	,	and	he	 ha 	 s 	 	 succeed 	 ed 	 	.
 I 	 s 	 	it	a	good	goal	?
In	 it 	 self 	 	,	I	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	we	all	agree	,	it	is	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	goal	.
He	's	 absolute 	 ly 	 	right	.
There	are	 lot 	 s 	 	of	people	out	there	who	do	n't	have	purpose	in	 the 	 ir 	 	life	,	and	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	purpose	to	 the 	 ir 	 	life	is	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	goal	.
I	give	him	an	 A 	  	  	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	.
 I 	 s 	 	the	goal	 achiev 	 ed 	 	?
Yes	.
30	million	copies	of	 th 	 is 	 	book	.
Al	 Go 	 re 	 	,	eat	your	heart	out	.
Just	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	Al	is	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	,	Rick	is	 do 	 ing 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	fantastic	 achiev 	 ement 	 	.
And	,	the	 mean 	 s 	 	--	how	 do 	 es 	 	he	do	it	?
It	's	a	 brilli 	 ant 	 	 re 	 design 	 	of	 tradition 	 al 	 	religious	 theme 	 s 	 	--	 up 	 d 	 ating 	 	them	,	 quiet 	 ly 	 	dropping	 obsolet 	 e 	 	 feature 	 s 	 	,	 put 	 ting 	 	new	 interpret 	 ations 	 	on	other	 feature 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	evolution	of	 relig 	 ion 	 	that	's	 be 	 en 	 	going	on	for	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	he	's	just	the	 lat 	 est 	 	 brilli 	 ant 	 	practitioner	of	it	.
I	do	n't	have	to	tell	you	 th 	 is 	 	.
You	've	just	heard	the	man	.
 Excel 	 lent 	 	 in 	 sight 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	human	 psycho 	 logy 	 	,	wise	 ad 	 vice 	 	on	every	page	.

I	 re 	 ally 	 	 appreciate 	 d 	 	that	.

With	me	,	 every 	 body 	 	--	every	time	you	read	it	or	say	it	,	you	make	 an 	 other 	 	copy	in	your	brain	.
Thank	you	.
And	now	we	come	to	my	problem	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	I	'm	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 since 	 re 	 	in	my	 appreci 	 ation 	 	of	all	that	I	've	 s 	 aid 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	book	.
But	I	wish	it	 we 	 re 	 	better	.
I	have	some	 problem 	 s 	 	with	the	book	.
And	it	would	just	be	 in 	 since 	 re 	 	of	me	not	to	address	 t 	 hose 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	.
I	wish	he	could	do	 th 	 is 	 	with	a	 re 	 vision 	 	,	a	Mark	2	version	of	his	book	.
``	The	truth	will	set	you	free	''	--	that	's	what	it	 say 	 s 	 	in	the	Bible	,	and	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	that	I	want	to	live	by	,	too	.
My	problem	is	,	some	of	the	bits	in	it	I	do	n't	think	are	true	.
 N 	 ow 	 	some	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	of	opinion	,	and	that	's	not	my	main	 complain 	 t 	 	.
That	's	worth	 ment 	 ion 	 ing 	 	.
 He 	 re 	 	's	a	 pass 	 age 	 	--	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	much	what	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	 any 	 way 	 	.
``	If	there	was	no	God	we	would	all	be	 accident 	 s 	 	,	the	result	of	astronomical	random	chance	in	the	 Univers 	 e 	 	.
You	could	stop	 read 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	book	 be 	 cause 	 	life	would	have	no	purpose	or	meaning	or	 sign 	 ific 	 ance 	 	.
There	would	be	no	right	or	wrong	and	no	hope	beyond	your	brief	 year 	 s 	 	on	Earth	.	''
 N 	 ow 	 	,	I	just	do	not	 believ 	 e 	 	that	.
By	the	way	,	I	find	 Hom 	 er 	 	 Groen 	 ing 	 	's	film	 present 	 ed 	 	a	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 alter 	 native 	 	to	that	 ver 	 y 	 	claim	.
Yes	,	there	is	meaning	and	a	reason	for	right	or	wrong	.
We	do	n't	need	a	belief	in	God	to	be	good	or	to	have	meaning	in	us	.
But	that	is	just	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	of	opinion	.
That	's	not	what	I	'm	 re 	 ally 	 	 worri 	 ed 	 	about	.
How	about	 th 	 is 	 	--	``	God	designed	 th 	 is 	 	planet	's	environment	just	so	we	could	live	in	it	.	''
I	'm	 af 	 raid 	 	that	a	lot	of	people	take	that	sentiment	to	mean	that	we	do	n't	have	to	do	the	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	Al	 Go 	 re 	 	is	 try 	 ing 	 	so	hard	to	get	us	to	do	.
I	'm	not	happy	with	that	sentiment	at	all	.
And	then	I	find	 th 	 is 	 	--	``	All	the	evidence	 avail 	 able 	 	in	the	 bio 	 logical 	 	 science 	 s 	 	 support 	 s 	 	the	core	 pro 	 position 	 	that	the	 cosmo 	 s 	 	is	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	designed	whole	with	life	and	 man 	 kind 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	fundamental	goal	and	purpose	,	a	whole	in	which	all	 facet 	 s 	 	of	 re 	 ality 	 	have	 the 	 ir 	 	meaning	and	 explan 	 ation 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	central	fact	.	''
Well	,	that	's	Michael	 Den 	 ton 	 	.	He	's	a	 creation 	 ist 	 	.
And	here	I	think	,	``	Wait	a	minute	.	''
I	read	 th 	 is 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.
I	read	it	three	or	four	 time 	 s 	 	and	I	think	,	``	 I 	 s 	 	he	 re 	 ally 	 	 end 	 ors 	 ing 	 	intelligent	design	?
 I 	 s 	 	he	 end 	 ors 	 ing 	 	 creation 	 ism 	 	here	?	''
And	you	ca	n't	tell	.
So	I	'm	sort	of	 think 	 ing 	 	,	``	Well	,	I	do	n't	know	,	I	do	n't	know	if	I	want	to	get	 up 	 set 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	yet	.	''
But	then	I	read	on	and	I	read	 th 	 is 	 	:	``	First	,	 No 	 ah 	 	had	never	 s 	 een 	 	rain	,	 be 	 cause 	 	prior	to	the	flood	God	 irrig 	 ated 	 	the	earth	from	the	ground	up	.	''
I	wish	that	sentence	 we 	 re 	 	n't	in	there	,	 be 	 cause 	 	I	think	it	is	false	.
And	I	think	that	 think 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	way	about	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	the	planet	,	after	we	've	just	 be 	 en 	 	 hear 	 ing 	 	about	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	the	planet	over	 million 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	 dis 	 courage 	 s 	 	people	from	scientific	 understand 	 ing 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	Rick	 War 	 ren 	 	uses	scientific	 term 	 s 	 	and	scientific	 fact 	 oid 	 s 	 	and	information	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	way	.
 He 	 re 	 	's	one	:	``	God	 de 	 liberate 	 ly 	 	shaped	and	 form 	 ed 	 	you	to	serve	him	in	a	way	that	 make 	 s 	 	your	 mini 	 stry 	 	 un 	 ique 	 	.
He	 care 	 fully 	 	 mix 	 ed 	 	the	DNA	 cock 	 tail 	 	that	 create 	 d 	 	you	.	''
I	think	that	's	false	.
 N 	 ow 	 	 may 	 be 	 	we	want	to	treat	it	 a 	 s 	 	 metaphor 	 ical 	 	.
 He 	 re 	 	's	 an 	 other 	 	one	--	``	For	 in 	 stance 	 	,	your	brain	can	store	100	trillion	 fact 	 s 	 	.
Your	mind	can	handle	15,000	 decision 	 s 	 	a	second	.	''
Well	,	it	would	be	 interest 	 ing 	 	to	find	the	 interpret 	 ation 	 	where	I	would	accept	that	.
There	might	be	some	way	of	 treat 	 ing 	 	that	 a 	 s 	 	true	.
``	 Anthropo 	 logists 	 	have	 not 	 ed 	 	that	worship	is	a	universal	urge	,	 hard 	 wired 	 	by	God	 in 	 to 	 	the	 ver 	 y 	 	fiber	of	our	 be 	 ing 	 	,	an	 in 	 built 	 	need	to	connect	with	God	.	''
Well	,	there	's	a	sense	which	I	agree	with	him	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	I	think	it	 ha 	 s 	 	an	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 explan 	 ation 	 	.
And	what	I	find	 deep 	 ly 	 	 trou 	 bling 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	book	is	that	he	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	 argu 	 ing 	 	that	if	you	want	to	be	moral	,	if	you	want	to	have	meaning	in	your	life	,	you	have	to	be	an	Intelligent	 Design 	 er 	 	--	you	have	to	 den 	 y 	 	the	 theor 	 y 	 	of	evolution	by	natural	 s 	 election 	 	.
And	I	think	,	on	the	 contr 	 ary 	 	,	that	it	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	to	solving	the	world	's	 problem 	 s 	 	that	we	take	 evolution 	 ary 	 	biology	 serious 	 ly 	 	.
 W 	 hose 	 	truth	are	we	going	to	listen	to	?
Well	,	 th 	 is 	 	from	``	The	 Pur 	 pose 	 	 Driv 	 en 	 	Life	''	--	``	The	Bible	must	 be 	 come 	 	the	 author 	 itative 	 	standard	for	my	life	,	the	compass	I	 re 	 ly 	 	on	for	direction	,	the	counsel	I	listen	to	for	making	wise	 decision 	 s 	 	and	the	 bench 	 mark 	 	I	use	for	 evalu 	 ating 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	.	''
Well	 may 	 be 	 	,	 O 	 K 	 	,	but	what	's	going	to	follow	from	 th 	 is 	 	?
And	here	's	one	that	 do 	 es 	 	concern	me	.
 Re 	 member 	 	I	 quote 	 d 	 	him	before	with	 th 	 is 	 	line	--	``	 Sur 	 render 	 ed 	 	people	obey	God	's	word	,	even	if	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	sense	.	''
And	that	's	a	problem	.
``	Do	n't	ever	 argu 	 e 	 	with	the	 De 	 vil 	 	.
He	's	better	at	 argu 	 ing 	 	than	you	are	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	had	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	to	practice	.	''
 N 	 ow 	 	Rick	 War 	 ren 	 	did	n't	invent	 th 	 is 	 	clever	move	.
It	's	an	old	move	.
It	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	clever	 adapt 	 ation 	 	of	 relig 	 ions 	 	.
It	's	a	 wild 	 card 	 	for	 dis 	 arm 	 ing 	 	any	 reason 	 able 	 	 critic 	 ism 	 	.
``	You	do	n't	like	my	 interpret 	 ation 	 	?
You	've	got	a	 reason 	 able 	 	 object 	 ion 	 	to	it	?
Do	n't	listen	,	do	n't	listen	!
That	's	the	 De 	 vil 	 	 s 	 peaking 	 	.	''
 Th 	 is 	 	 dis 	 courage 	 s 	 	the	sort	of	 reason 	 ing 	 	 citizen 	 ship 	 	it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	me	that	we	want	to	have	.
I	've	got	one	more	problem	,	then	I	'm	through	.
And	I	'd	 re 	 ally 	 	like	to	get	a	 respons 	 e 	 	if	Rick	is	able	to	do	it	.
``	In	the	Great	 Com 	 mission 	 	,	 Je 	 s 	 us 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	'Go	to	all	people	of	all	 nation 	 s 	 	and	make	them	my	 discip 	 les 	 	.

'	''	The	Bible	 say 	 s 	 	 Je 	 s 	 us 	 	is	the	 on 	 ly 	 	one	who	can	 s 	 ave 	 	the	world	.
 N 	 ow 	 	here	we	've	 s 	 een 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 map 	 s 	 	of	the	world	in	the	last	day	or	so	.

And	here	's	one	that	 show 	 s 	 	the	sort	of	current	 break 	 down 	 	of	the	different	 relig 	 ions 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	do	we	 re 	 ally 	 	want	to	commit	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	to	 engulf 	 ing 	 	all	the	other	 relig 	 ions 	 	when	 the 	 ir 	 	holy	 book 	 s 	 	are	 tell 	 ing 	 	them	,	``	Do	n't	listen	to	the	other	side	,	that	's	just	 Sa 	 tan 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	!	''
It	 seem 	 s 	 	to	me	that	that	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 problem 	 atic 	 	ship	to	get	on	for	the	future	.
I	found	 th 	 is 	 	sign	 a 	 s 	 	I	was	 driv 	 ing 	 	to	 Main 	 e 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	in	front	of	a	church	--	``	Good	 with 	 out 	 	God	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	zero	.	''

A	 ver 	 y 	 	clever	little	meme	.
I	do	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	it	and	I	think	 th 	 is 	 	idea	,	popular	 a 	 s 	 	it	is	--	not	in	 th 	 is 	 	guise	but	in	general	--	is	 it 	 self 	 	one	of	the	main	 problem 	 s 	 	that	we	face	.
If	you	are	like	me	,	you	know	 man 	 y 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	,	 commit 	 ted 	 	,	 engag 	 ed 	 	 atheist 	 s 	 	,	 agnostic 	 s 	 	,	who	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 with 	 out 	 	God	.

 Son 	 a 	 ar 	 	 Lu 	 thra 	 	:	Meet	the	Water	 Can 	 ary 	 
 C 	 hole 	 ra 	 	was	 report 	 ed 	 	in	Haiti	for	the	first	time	in	over	50	 year 	 s 	 	last	 Oct 	 ob 	 er 	 	.
There	was	no	way	to	predict	how	far	it	would	spread	through	water	 suppli 	 es 	 	and	how	bad	the	 situ 	 ation 	 	would	get	.
And	not	 know 	 ing 	 	where	help	was	 need 	 ed 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	 ensure 	 d 	 	that	help	was	in	short	supply	in	the	 area 	 s 	 	that	 need 	 ed 	 	it	most	.
We	've	gotten	good	at	 predict 	 ing 	 	and	 pre 	 par 	 ing 	 	for	 storm 	 s 	 	before	they	take	 innoc 	 ent 	 	 live 	 s 	 	and	cause	 ir 	 revers 	 ible 	 	damage	,	but	we	still	ca	n't	do	that	with	water	,	and	here	's	why	.
Right	now	,	if	you	want	to	test	water	in	the	field	,	you	need	a	trained	technician	,	expensive	 equi 	 p 	 ment 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	you	have	to	wait	about	a	day	for	chemical	 react 	 ions 	 	to	take	place	and	provide	 result 	 s 	 	.
It	's	too	 s 	 low 	 	to	get	a	picture	of	 condition 	 s 	 	on	the	ground	before	they	change	,	too	expensive	to	implement	in	all	the	 place 	 s 	 	that	 requir 	 e 	 	 test 	 ing 	 	.
And	it	 ignor 	 es 	 	the	fact	that	,	in	the	 mean 	 while 	 	,	people	still	need	to	drink	water	.
 Mo 	 st 	 	of	the	information	that	we	 collect 	 ed 	 	on	the	cholera	 out 	 break 	 	did	n't	come	from	 test 	 ing 	 	water	;	it	came	from	 form 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	which	 document 	 ed 	 	all	the	people	we	 fail 	 ed 	 	to	help	.
 Count 	 less 	 	 live 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 av 	 ed 	 	by	 can 	 aries 	 	in	 coal 	 mine 	 s 	 	--	a	simple	and	 in 	 valu 	 able 	 	way	for	 min 	 ers 	 	to	know	 whet 	 her 	 	they	're	safe	.
I	've	 be 	 en 	 	inspired	by	that	 simpl 	 icity 	 	 a 	 s 	 	I	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	problem	with	some	of	the	most	 hard 	 work 	 ing 	 	and	 brilli 	 ant 	 	people	I	've	ever	known	.
We	think	there	's	a	 simpl 	 er 	 	solution	to	 th 	 is 	 	problem	--	one	that	can	be	used	by	people	who	face	 condition 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	 every 	 day 	 	.
It	's	in	 it 	 s 	 	early	 stage 	 s 	 	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	right	now	.
We	call	it	the	Water	 Can 	 ary 	 	.
It	's	a	fast	,	cheap	 de 	 vice 	 	that	 answer 	 s 	 	an	 import 	 ant 	 	question	:	 I 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	water	 contami 	 nated 	 	?
It	 do 	 es 	 	n't	 requir 	 e 	 	any	special	training	.
And	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	chemical	 react 	 ions 	 	to	take	place	,	it	uses	light	.
That	 mean 	 s 	 	there	's	no	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	chemical	 react 	 ions 	 	to	take	place	,	no	need	to	use	 re 	 agent 	 s 	 	that	can	run	out	and	no	need	to	be	an	expert	to	get	 action 	 able 	 	information	.
To	test	water	,	you	 simpl 	 y 	 	insert	a	 s 	 ample 	 	and	,	 with 	 in 	 	 second 	 s 	 	,	it	either	 dis 	 play 	 s 	 	a	red	light	,	 indic 	 ating 	 	 contami 	 nated 	 	water	,	or	a	green	light	,	 indic 	 ating 	 	the	 s 	 ample 	 	is	safe	.
 Th 	 is 	 	will	make	it	possible	for	 any 	 one 	 	to	collect	 life 	 - 	 saving 	 	information	and	to	monitor	water	quality	 condition 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	 un 	 fold 	 	.
We	're	 al 	 so 	 	,	on	top	of	that	,	 integ 	 rating 	 	 wire 	 less 	 	 network 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	an	 afford 	 able 	 	 de 	 vice 	 	with	 GP 	 S 	 	and	 G 	 SM 	 	.
What	that	 mean 	 s 	 	is	that	each	 read 	 ing 	 	can	be	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	 transmit 	 ted 	 	to	 serv 	 ers 	 	to	be	 ma 	 pped 	 	in	real	time	.
With	 en 	 ough 	 	 user 	 s 	 	,	 map 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	will	make	it	possible	to	take	 prevent 	 ive 	 	action	,	 contain 	 ing 	 	 hazard 	 s 	 	before	they	turn	 in 	 to 	 	 emerge 	 ncies 	 	that	take	 year 	 s 	 	to	 re 	 cover 	 	from	.
And	then	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	taking	 day 	 s 	 	to	disseminate	 th 	 is 	 	information	to	the	people	who	need	it	most	,	it	can	happen	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	.
We	've	 s 	 een 	 	how	 distribut 	 ed 	 	 network 	 s 	 	,	big	data	and	information	can	transform	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
I	think	it	's	time	for	us	to	 app 	 ly 	 	them	to	water	.
Our	goal	over	the	next	year	is	to	get	Water	 Can 	 ary 	 	ready	for	the	field	and	to	 open 	 - 	 source 	 	the	 hard 	 ware 	 	so	that	 any 	 one 	 	can	 con 	 tribute 	 	to	the	 develop 	 ment 	 	and	the	 evalu 	 ation 	 	,	so	we	can	tackle	 th 	 is 	 	problem	together	.

Paul	 Nick 	 len 	 	:	 Tal 	 es 	 	of	 ice 	 - 	 bound 	 	 wonder 	 land 	 s 	 
My	journey	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	polar	 special 	 ist 	 	,	 photograph 	 ing 	 	,	 special 	 izing 	 	in	the	polar	 region 	 s 	 	,	 beg 	 an 	 	when	I	was	four	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	when	my	family	 move 	 d 	 	from	 South 	 ern 	 	Canada	to	 North 	 ern 	 	 B 	 affin 	 	Island	,	up	by	 Green 	 land 	 	.
There	we	lived	with	the	 In 	 uit 	 	in	the	 tin 	 y 	 	 In 	 uit 	 	community	of	200	 In 	 uit 	 	people	,	where	[	we	]	 we 	 re 	 	one	of	three	 non 	 - 	 In 	 uit 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	.
And	in	 th 	 is 	 	community	,	we	did	n't	have	a	 tele 	 vision 	 	;	we	did	n't	have	 computer 	 s 	 	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	radio	.
We	did	n't	even	have	a	 tele 	 phone 	 	.
All	of	my	time	was	 s 	 pent 	 	 out 	 side 	 	with	the	 In 	 uit 	 	,	 play 	 ing 	 	.
The	snow	and	the	ice	 we 	 re 	 	my	 sand 	 box 	 	,	and	the	 In 	 uit 	 	 we 	 re 	 	my	 teacher 	 s 	 	.
And	that	's	where	I	 be 	 came 	 	 tru 	 ly 	 	 obsess 	 ed 	 	with	 th 	 is 	 	polar	realm	.
And	I	 k 	 new 	 	 some 	 day 	 	that	I	was	going	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	that	had	to	do	with	 try 	 ing 	 	to	share	news	about	it	and	protect	it	.
I	'd	like	to	share	with	you	,	for	just	two	 minute 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	,	some	 image 	 s 	 	,	a	 cross 	 - 	 section 	 	of	my	work	,	to	the	 beaut 	 iful 	 	music	by	 Brand 	 i 	 	 Carl 	 ile 	 	,	``	 Hav 	 e 	 	You	Ever	.	''
I	do	n't	know	why	National	 Geo 	 graphic 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	they	've	never	 d 	 one 	 	 th 	 is 	 	before	,	but	they	're	 allow 	 ing 	 	me	to	show	you	a	few	 image 	 s 	 	from	a	 cover 	 age 	 	that	I	've	just	 complete 	 d 	 	that	is	not	 publish 	 ed 	 	yet	.
National	 Geo 	 graphic 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	so	I	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	to	be	able	to	share	 th 	 is 	 	with	you	.
And	what	these	 image 	 s 	 	are	--	you	'll	see	them	at	the	start	of	the	slide	show	--	there	's	 on 	 ly 	 	about	four	 image 	 s 	 	--	but	it	's	of	a	little	bear	that	 live 	 s 	 	in	the	Great	Bear	 Rain 	 forest 	 	.
It	's	 pur 	 e 	 	white	,	but	it	's	not	a	polar	bear	.
It	's	a	spirit	bear	,	or	a	 Ker 	 mode 	 	bear	.
There	are	 on 	 ly 	 	200	of	these	 bear 	 s 	 	left	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	more	rare	than	the	 pan 	 da 	 	bear	.
I	 s 	 at 	 	there	on	the	river	for	two	 month 	 s 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	one	.
I	thought	,	my	 care 	 er 	 	's	over	.
I	 pro 	 posed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	stupid	story	to	National	 Geo 	 graphic 	 	.
What	in	the	heck	was	I	 think 	 ing 	 	?
So	I	had	two	 month 	 s 	 	to	 s 	 it 	 	there	and	figure	out	different	ways	of	what	I	was	going	to	do	in	my	next	life	,	after	I	was	a	 photograph 	 er 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	fire	me	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	National	 Geo 	 graphic 	 	is	a	magazine	;	they	 re 	 mind 	 	us	all	the	time	:	they	publish	 picture 	 s 	 	,	not	 excuse 	 s 	 	.
And	after	two	 month 	 s 	 	of	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	--	one	day	,	 think 	 ing 	 	that	it	was	all	over	,	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	big	white	male	came	down	,	right	 be 	 side 	 	me	,	three	feet	away	from	me	,	and	he	went	down	and	 grab 	 bed 	 	a	fish	and	went	off	in	the	forest	and	ate	it	.
And	then	I	 s 	 pent 	 	the	entire	day	living	my	 child 	 hood 	 	dream	of	 walk 	 ing 	 	around	with	 th 	 is 	 	bear	through	the	forest	.
He	went	through	 th 	 is 	 	 old 	 - 	 growth 	 	forest	and	 s 	 at 	 	up	 be 	 side 	 	 th 	 is 	 	400-year-old	 cultural 	 ly 	 	 modifi 	 ed 	 	tree	and	went	to	sleep	.
And	I	 actual 	 ly 	 	got	to	sleep	 with 	 in 	 	three	feet	of	him	,	just	in	the	forest	,	and	photograph	him	.
So	I	'm	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ed 	 	to	be	able	to	show	you	 t 	 hose 	 	 image 	 s 	 	and	a	 cross 	 - 	 section 	 	of	my	work	that	I	've	 d 	 one 	 	on	the	polar	 region 	 s 	 	.
 P 	 lease 	 	enjoy	.
My	clock	is	 tick 	 ing 	 	.	 Oka 	 y 	 	,	let	's	stop	.
Thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.	I	appreciate	it	.
We	're	 in 	 un 	 d 	 ated 	 	with	news	all	the	time	that	the	sea	ice	is	 disappear 	 ing 	 	and	it	's	at	 it 	 s 	 	 low 	 est 	 	level	.
And	in	fact	,	 scientist 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 original 	 ly 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	sea	ice	is	going	to	disappear	in	the	next	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	,	then	they	 s 	 aid 	 	50	 year 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	they	're	 say 	 ing 	 	the	sea	ice	in	the	 Arc 	 tic 	 	,	the	 summer 	 time 	 	 ex 	 tent 	 	is	going	to	be	gone	in	the	next	four	to	10	 year 	 s 	 	.
And	what	 do 	 es 	 	that	mean	?
After	a	while	of	 read 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	in	the	news	,	it	just	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	news	.
You	 glaz 	 e 	 	over	with	it	.
And	what	I	'm	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	my	work	is	put	 face 	 s 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	.
And	I	want	people	to	understand	and	get	the	 con 	 cept 	 	that	,	if	we	lose	ice	,	we	stand	to	lose	an	entire	 eco 	 system 	 	.
 Project 	 ions 	 	are	that	we	could	lose	polar	 bear 	 s 	 	;	they	could	 be 	 come 	 	extinct	in	the	next	50	to	100	 year 	 s 	 	.
And	there	's	no	better	,	 s 	 ex 	 ier 	 	,	more	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	 charisma 	 tic 	 	 mega 	 fauna 	 	species	for	me	to	hang	my	campaign	on	.
Polar	 bear 	 s 	 	are	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 hunter 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	was	a	bear	I	 s 	 at 	 	with	for	a	while	on	the	 shore 	 s 	 	.
There	was	no	ice	around	.
But	 th 	 is 	 	 glaci 	 er 	 	 cav 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	water	and	a	seal	got	on	it	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	bear	swam	out	to	that	seal	--	800	lb	.	 beard 	 ed 	 	seal	--	 grab 	 bed 	 	it	,	swam	back	and	ate	it	.
And	he	was	so	full	,	he	was	so	happy	and	so	fat	eating	 th 	 is 	 	seal	,	that	,	 a 	 s 	 	I	 approach 	 ed 	 	him	--	about	20	feet	away	--	to	get	 th 	 is 	 	picture	,	his	 on 	 ly 	 	defense	was	to	keep	eating	more	seal	.
And	 a 	 s 	 	he	ate	,	he	was	so	full	--	he	 prob 	 ably 	 	had	about	200	 lb 	 s 	 	of	meat	in	his	 bel 	 ly 	 	--	and	 a 	 s 	 	he	ate	 in 	 side 	 	one	side	of	his	mouth	,	he	was	 regurgit 	 ating 	 	out	the	other	side	of	his	mouth	.
So	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	these	 bear 	 s 	 	have	any	bit	of	ice	they	will	 surviv 	 e 	 	,	but	it	's	the	ice	that	's	 disappear 	 ing 	 	.
We	're	 find 	 ing 	 	more	and	more	dead	 bear 	 s 	 	in	the	 Arc 	 tic 	 	.
When	I	 work 	 ed 	 	on	polar	 bear 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	biologist	20	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	we	never	found	dead	 bear 	 s 	 	.
And	in	the	last	four	or	five	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	're	 find 	 ing 	 	dead	 bear 	 s 	 	 pop 	 ping 	 	up	all	over	the	place	.
We	're	 see 	 ing 	 	them	in	the	 Beau 	 fort 	 	Sea	,	 float 	 ing 	 	in	the	open	ocean	where	the	ice	 ha 	 s 	 	 melt 	 ed 	 	out	.
I	found	a	couple	in	 Nor 	 way 	 	last	year	.	We	're	 see 	 ing 	 	them	on	the	ice	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	 bear 	 s 	 	are	 al 	 ready 	 	 show 	 ing 	 	 sign 	 s 	 	of	the	stress	of	 disappear 	 ing 	 	ice	.
 He 	 re 	 	's	a	mother	and	her	two	 year 	 - 	 old 	 	cub	 we 	 re 	 	 travel 	 ing 	 	on	a	ship	a	hundred	 mile 	 s 	 	 off 	 shore 	 	in	the	middle	of	 no 	 where 	 	,	and	they	're	 rid 	 ing 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	big	piece	of	 glaci 	 er 	 	ice	,	which	is	great	for	them	;	they	're	safe	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	not	going	to	die	of	 hypo 	 ther 	 mia 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	going	to	get	to	land	.
But	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	95	percent	of	the	 glaci 	 ers 	 	in	the	 Arc 	 tic 	 	are	 al 	 so 	 	 reced 	 ing 	 	right	now	to	the	point	that	the	ice	is	 end 	 ing 	 	up	on	land	and	not	 inject 	 ing 	 	any	ice	back	 in 	 to 	 	the	 eco 	 system 	 	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	 ring 	 ed 	 	 seal 	 s 	 	,	these	are	the	``	 fat 	 s 	 icles 	 	''	of	the	 Arc 	 tic 	 	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	little	,	fat	 dump 	 ling 	 s 	 	,	150-pound	 bundl 	 es 	 	of	 blu 	 b 	 ber 	 	are	the	 main 	 stay 	 	of	the	polar	bear	.
And	they	're	not	like	the	harbor	 seal 	 s 	 	that	you	have	here	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	 ring 	 ed 	 	 seal 	 s 	 	 al 	 so 	 	live	out	 the 	 ir 	 	entire	life	cycle	 associate 	 d 	 	and	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	sea	ice	.
 The 	 y 	 	give	birth	 in 	 side 	 	the	ice	,	and	they	feed	on	the	 Arc 	 tic 	 	cod	that	live	under	the	ice	.
And	here	's	a	picture	of	sick	ice	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	piece	of	 multi 	 - 	 year 	 	ice	that	's	12	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
And	what	 scientist 	 s 	 	did	n't	predict	is	that	,	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	ice	 melt 	 s 	 	,	these	big	 pocket 	 s 	 	of	black	water	are	 form 	 ing 	 	and	they	're	 grab 	 bing 	 	the	 s 	 un 	 	's	energy	and	 accele 	 rating 	 	the	 melt 	 ing 	 	process	.
And	here	we	are	 div 	 ing 	 	in	the	 Beau 	 fort 	 	Sea	.
The	 vis 	 ibility 	 	's	600	ft.	;	we	're	on	our	 safe 	 ty 	 	lines	;	the	ice	is	moving	all	over	the	place	.
I	wish	I	could	 s 	 pend 	 	half	an	hour	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	about	how	we	 al 	 most 	 	 di 	 ed 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	 d 	 ive 	 	.
But	what	's	 import 	 ant 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	picture	is	that	you	have	a	piece	of	 multi 	 - 	 year 	 	ice	,	that	big	chunk	of	ice	up	in	the	corner	.
In	that	one	single	piece	of	ice	,	you	have	300	species	of	 micro 	 organism 	 s 	 	.
And	in	the	spring	,	when	the	 s 	 un 	 	 return 	 s 	 	to	the	ice	,	it	 form 	 s 	 	the	 phy 	 to 	 plankton 	 	,	 grow 	 s 	 	under	that	ice	,	and	then	you	get	 big 	 ger 	 	 sheet 	 s 	 	of	 sea 	 weed 	 	,	and	then	you	get	the	zoo	plankton	 feed 	 ing 	 	on	all	that	life	.
So	 re 	 ally 	 	what	the	ice	 do 	 es 	 	is	it	 act 	 s 	 	like	a	garden	.
It	 act 	 s 	 	like	the	 s 	 oil 	 	in	a	garden	.	It	's	an	 in 	 vert 	 ed 	 	garden	.
 Lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	that	ice	is	like	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	the	 s 	 oil 	 	in	a	garden	.
 He 	 re 	 	's	me	in	my	 off 	 ice 	 	.
I	hope	you	appreciate	 your 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	after	an	hour	under	the	ice	.
I	ca	n't	feel	my	lips	;	my	face	is	 froze 	 n 	 	;	I	ca	n't	feel	my	 hand 	 s 	 	;	I	ca	n't	feel	my	feet	.
And	I	've	come	up	,	and	all	I	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	was	get	out	of	the	water	.
After	an	hour	in	these	 condition 	 s 	 	,	it	's	so	 extrem 	 e 	 	that	,	when	I	go	down	,	 al 	 most 	 	every	 d 	 ive 	 	I	vomit	 in 	 to 	 	my	 regulat 	 or 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	my	body	ca	n't	deal	with	the	stress	of	the	cold	on	my	head	.
And	so	I	'm	just	so	happy	that	the	 d 	 ive 	 	is	over	.
I	get	to	hand	my	camera	to	my	 assist 	 ant 	 	,	and	I	'm	looking	up	at	him	,	and	I	'm	going	,	``	 Wo 	 o 	 	.	 Wo 	 o 	 	.	 Wo 	 o 	 	.	''
 Whi 	 ch 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	,	``	Take	my	camera	.	''
And	he	 think 	 s 	 	I	'm	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	Take	my	picture	.	''
So	we	had	 th 	 is 	 	little	communication	 break 	 down 	 	.
But	it	's	worth	it	.
I	'm	going	to	show	you	 picture 	 s 	 	of	 bel 	 uga 	 	 whale 	 s 	 	,	 bow 	 head 	 	 whale 	 s 	 	,	and	 nar 	 whal 	 s 	 	,	and	polar	 bear 	 s 	 	,	and	leopard	 seal 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	picture	right	here	 mean 	 s 	 	more	to	me	than	any	other	I	've	ever	made	.
I	 drop 	 ped 	 	down	in	 th 	 is 	 	ice	hole	,	just	through	that	hole	that	you	just	saw	,	and	I	 look 	 ed 	 	up	under	the	 under 	 side 	 	of	the	ice	,	and	I	was	dizzy	;	I	thought	I	had	 vert 	 i 	 go 	 	.
I	got	 ver 	 y 	 	nervous	--	no	rope	,	no	 safe 	 ty 	 	line	,	the	whole	world	is	moving	around	me	--	and	I	thought	,	``	I	'm	in	trouble	.	''
But	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	is	that	the	entire	 under 	 side 	 	was	full	of	these	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 amphi 	 pods 	 	and	 cope 	 pods 	 	moving	around	and	 feed 	 ing 	 	on	the	 under 	 side 	 	of	the	ice	,	giving	birth	and	living	out	 the 	 ir 	 	entire	life	cycle	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	 found 	 ation 	 	of	the	whole	food	chain	in	the	 Arc 	 tic 	 	,	right	here	.
And	when	you	have	low	 product 	 ivity 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	,	in	ice	,	the	 product 	 ivity 	 	in	 cope 	 pods 	 	go	down	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	 bow 	 head 	 	whale	.
 Sup 	 posed 	 ly 	 	,	science	is	 stat 	 ing 	 	that	it	could	be	the	 old 	 est 	 	living	animal	on	earth	right	now	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	whale	right	here	could	be	over	250	 year 	 s 	 	old	.
 Th 	 is 	 	whale	could	have	 be 	 en 	 	born	around	the	start	of	the	 Indus 	 trial 	 	 R 	 evolution 	 	.
It	could	have	 surviv 	 ed 	 	150	 year 	 s 	 	of	 whal 	 ing 	 	.
And	now	 it 	 s 	 	 big 	 gest 	 	threat	is	the	 disappear 	 ance 	 	of	ice	in	the	North	 be 	 cause 	 	of	the	 live 	 s 	 	that	we	're	 lead 	 ing 	 	in	the	South	.
 Nar 	 whal 	 s 	 	,	these	 majes 	 tic 	 	 nar 	 whal 	 s 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 eight 	 - 	 foot 	 	long	 iv 	 ory 	 	 tusk 	 s 	 	,	do	n't	have	to	be	here	;	they	could	be	out	on	the	open	water	.
But	they	're	forcing	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	to	come	up	in	these	 tin 	 y 	 	little	ice	 hole 	 s 	 	where	they	can	breathe	,	catch	a	breath	,	 be 	 cause 	 	right	under	that	ice	are	all	the	 s 	 warm 	 s 	 	of	cod	.
And	the	cod	are	there	 be 	 cause 	 	they	are	 feed 	 ing 	 	on	all	the	 cope 	 pods 	 	and	 amphi 	 pods 	 	.
 Al 	 right 	 	,	my	 favor 	 ite 	 	part	.
When	I	'm	on	my	 death 	 bed 	 	,	I	'm	going	to	remember	one	story	more	than	any	other	.
Even	 th 	 ough 	 	that	spirit	bear	moment	was	 power 	 ful 	 	,	I	do	n't	think	I	'll	ever	have	 an 	 other 	 	experience	like	I	did	with	these	leopard	 seal 	 s 	 	.
 Leop 	 ard 	 	 seal 	 s 	 	,	since	the	time	of	 S 	 hack 	 leton 	 	,	have	had	a	bad	reputation	.
 The 	 y 	 	've	got	that	 wry 	 ly 	 	 s 	 mile 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	mouth	.
 The 	 y 	 	've	got	 t 	 hose 	 	black	 s 	 ini 	 ster 	 	 eye 	 s 	 	and	 t 	 hose 	 	 spot 	 s 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	body	.
 The 	 y 	 	look	 positive 	 ly 	 	 pre 	 historic 	 	and	a	bit	 scar 	 y 	 	.
And	 tragic 	 ally 	 	in	[	2003	]	,	a	scientist	was	taken	down	and	 drown 	 ed 	 	,	and	she	was	 be 	 ing 	 	 consum 	 ed 	 	by	a	leopard	seal	.
And	people	 we 	 re 	 	like	,	``	We	 k 	 new 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 vic 	 ious 	 	.	We	 k 	 new 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	.	''
And	so	people	love	to	form	 the 	 ir 	 	 opinion 	 s 	 	.
And	that	's	when	I	got	a	story	idea	:	I	want	to	go	to	 Antarctic 	 a 	 	,	get	in	the	water	with	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	leopard	 seal 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	I	possibly	can	and	give	them	a	fair	shake	--	find	out	if	they	 re 	 ally 	 	are	these	 vic 	 ious 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	,	or	if	they	're	 mis 	 under 	 stood 	 	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	story	.
Oh	,	and	they	 al 	 so 	 	happen	to	eat	happy	feet	.
 A 	 s 	 	a	species	,	 a 	 s 	 	 human 	 s 	 	,	we	like	to	say	 penguin 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	cute	,	 there 	 fore 	 	,	leopard	 seal 	 s 	 	eat	them	,	so	leopard	 seal 	 s 	 	are	 ug 	 ly 	 	and	bad	.
It	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	that	way	.
The	penguin	 do 	 es 	 	n't	know	it	's	cute	,	and	the	leopard	seal	 do 	 es 	 	n't	know	it	's	kind	of	big	and	 monstr 	 ous 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	just	the	food	chain	 un 	 fold 	 ing 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	 al 	 so 	 	big	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	not	these	little	harbor	 seal 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	are	12	ft.	long	,	a	thousand	 pound 	 s 	 	.
And	they	're	 al 	 so 	 	 cur 	 iously 	 	 aggress 	 ive 	 	.
You	get	12	 tourist 	 s 	 	 pack 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	Zodiac	,	 float 	 ing 	 	in	these	 ic 	 y 	 	 water 	 s 	 	,	and	a	leopard	seal	 come 	 s 	 	up	and	 bite 	 s 	 	the	pontoon	.
The	boat	 start 	 s 	 	to	sink	,	they	race	back	to	the	ship	and	get	to	go	home	and	tell	the	 st 	 ories 	 	of	how	they	got	 attack 	 ed 	 	.
All	the	leopard	seal	was	 do 	 ing 	 	--	it	's	just	 bit 	 ing 	 	a	balloon	.
It	just	 s 	 ees 	 	 th 	 is 	 	big	balloon	in	the	ocean	--	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	 hand 	 s 	 	--	it	's	going	to	take	a	little	bite	,	the	boat	 pop 	 s 	 	,	and	off	they	go	.
So	after	five	 day 	 s 	 	of	 cross 	 ing 	 	the	 D 	 rake 	 	 Pass 	 age 	 	--	is	n't	that	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
After	five	 day 	 s 	 	of	 cross 	 ing 	 	the	 D 	 rake 	 	 Pass 	 age 	 	,	we	have	 final 	 ly 	 	 arriv 	 ed 	 	at	 Antarctic 	 a 	 	.
I	'm	with	my	 Swe 	 dish 	 	 assist 	 ant 	 	and	guide	.
 Hi 	 s 	 	name	is	 Go 	 ran 	 	Ehlme	from	 Swede 	 n 	 	--	 Go 	 ran 	 	.
And	he	 ha 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	experience	with	leopard	 seal 	 s 	 	.	I	have	never	 s 	 een 	 	one	.
So	we	come	around	the	cove	in	our	little	Zodiac	boat	,	and	there	's	 th 	 is 	 	 monstr 	 ous 	 	leopard	seal	.
And	even	in	his	voice	,	he	 go 	 es 	 	,	``	That	's	a	 blood 	 y 	 	big	seal	,	ya	.	''
And	 th 	 is 	 	seal	is	taking	 th 	 is 	 	penguin	by	the	head	,	and	it	's	 flip 	 ping 	 	it	back	and	forth	.
And	what	it	's	 try 	 ing 	 	to	do	is	turn	that	penguin	 in 	 side 	 - 	 out 	 	,	so	it	can	eat	the	meat	off	the	 bone 	 s 	 	,	and	then	it	 go 	 es 	 	off	and	 get 	 s 	 	 an 	 other 	 	one	.
And	so	 th 	 is 	 	leopard	seal	 grab 	 bed 	 	 an 	 other 	 	penguin	,	came	under	the	boat	,	the	Zodiac	,	 start 	 ing 	 	hitting	the	hull	of	the	boat	.
And	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	not	fall	in	the	water	.
And	we	 s 	 it 	 	down	,	and	that	's	when	 Go 	 ran 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	,	``	 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	good	seal	,	ya	.
It	's	time	for	you	to	get	in	the	water	.	''
And	I	 look 	 ed 	 	at	 Go 	 ran 	 	,	and	I	 s 	 aid 	 	to	him	,	``	Forget	that	.	''
But	I	think	I	 prob 	 ably 	 	used	a	different	word	 start 	 ing 	 	with	the	letter	F	.
But	he	was	right	.
He	 s 	 cold 	 ed 	 	me	out	,	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 Th 	 is 	 	is	why	we	're	here	.
And	you	 purpose 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	stupid	story	to	National	 Geo 	 graphic 	 	.
And	now	you	've	got	to	deliver	.
And	you	ca	n't	publish	 excuse 	 s 	 	.	''
So	I	had	 s 	 uch 	 	dry	mouth	--	 prob 	 ably 	 	not	 a 	 s 	 	bad	 a 	 s 	 	now	--	but	I	had	 s 	 uch 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	dry	mouth	.
And	my	 leg 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	just	 trem 	 bling 	 	.	I	could	n't	feel	my	 leg 	 s 	 	.
I	put	my	 flip 	 per 	 s 	 	on	.	I	could	 bare 	 ly 	 	part	my	lips	.
I	put	my	snorkel	in	my	mouth	,	and	I	 roll 	 ed 	 	over	the	side	of	the	Zodiac	 in 	 to 	 	the	water	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	was	the	first	thing	she	did	.
She	came	 rac 	 ing 	 	up	to	me	,	 engulf 	 ed 	 	my	whole	camera	--	and	her	 tee 	 th 	 	are	up	here	and	down	here	--	but	 Go 	 ran 	 	,	before	I	had	gotten	in	the	water	,	had	 give 	 n 	 	me	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 ad 	 vice 	 	.
He	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	If	you	get	 scar 	 ed 	 	,	you	close	your	 eye 	 s 	 	,	ya	,	and	she	'll	go	away	.	''
So	that	's	all	I	had	to	work	with	at	that	point	.
But	I	just	 start 	 ed 	 	to	shoot	these	 picture 	 s 	 	.
So	she	did	 th 	 is 	 	threat	 dis 	 play 	 	for	a	few	 minute 	 s 	 	,	and	then	the	most	 amaz 	 ing 	 	thing	 happen 	 ed 	 	--	she	 total 	 ly 	 	 relax 	 ed 	 	.
She	went	off	,	she	got	a	penguin	.
She	 stop 	 ped 	 	about	10	feet	away	from	me	,	and	she	 s 	 at 	 	there	with	 th 	 is 	 	penguin	,	the	penguin	's	flapping	,	and	she	let	's	it	go	.
The	penguin	 swim 	 s 	 	 to 	 ward 	 	me	,	 take 	 s 	 	off	.
She	 grab 	 s 	 	 an 	 other 	 	one	.	She	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	over	and	over	.
And	it	 dawn 	 ed 	 	on	me	that	she	's	 try 	 ing 	 	to	feed	me	a	penguin	.
Why	else	would	she	 re 	 lease 	 	these	 penguin 	 s 	 	at	me	?
And	after	she	did	 th 	 is 	 	four	or	five	 time 	 s 	 	,	she	swam	by	me	with	 th 	 is 	 	 d 	 eject 	 ed 	 	look	on	her	face	.
You	do	n't	want	to	be	too	 anthropo 	 morphic 	 	,	but	I	 s 	 wear 	 	that	she	 look 	 ed 	 	at	me	like	,	``	 Th 	 is 	 	 use 	 less 	 	predator	's	going	to	 starv 	 e 	 	in	my	ocean	.	''
So	 real 	 izing 	 	I	could	n't	catch	 swimm 	 ing 	 	 penguin 	 s 	 	,	she	'd	get	these	other	 penguin 	 s 	 	and	 br 	 ing 	 	them	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	me	,	 bobb 	 ing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	she	'd	let	them	go	.
 Th 	 is 	 	did	n't	work	.
I	was	 laugh 	 ing 	 	so	hard	and	so	 emotion 	 al 	 	that	my	mask	was	 flood 	 ing 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	I	was	 cry 	 ing 	 	 under 	 water 	 	,	just	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	so	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
And	so	that	did	n't	work	.
So	then	she	'd	get	 an 	 other 	 	penguin	and	try	 th 	 is 	 	 ballet 	 - 	 like 	 	sexy	 dis 	 play 	 	 slid 	 ing 	 	down	 th 	 is 	 	 ice 	 berg 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
And	she	would	sort	of	 br 	 ing 	 	them	over	to	me	and	 off 	 er 	 	it	to	me	.
 Th 	 is 	 	went	on	for	four	 day 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	just	did	n't	happen	a	couple	of	 time 	 s 	 	.
And	then	so	she	 real 	 ized 	 	I	could	n't	catch	live	 one 	 s 	 	,	so	she	 br 	 ought 	 	me	dead	 penguin 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	I	've	got	four	or	five	 penguin 	 s 	 	 float 	 ing 	 	around	my	head	,	and	I	'm	just	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	there	 shoot 	 ing 	 	away	.
And	she	would	often	stop	and	have	 th 	 is 	 	 d 	 eject 	 ed 	 	look	on	her	face	like	,	``	 A 	 re 	 	you	for	real	?	''
 Be 	 cause 	 	she	ca	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	I	ca	n't	eat	 th 	 is 	 	penguin	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	in	her	world	,	you	're	either	 breed 	 ing 	 	or	you	're	eating	--	and	I	'm	not	 breed 	 ing 	 	,	so	...
And	then	that	was	n't	 en 	 ough 	 	;	she	 start 	 ed 	 	to	flip	 penguin 	 s 	 	onto	my	head	.
She	was	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 force 	 - 	 feed 	 	me	.	She	's	 push 	 ing 	 	me	around	.
She	's	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 force 	 - 	 feed 	 	my	camera	,	which	is	every	 photograph 	 er 	 	's	dream	.
And	she	would	get	 frust 	 rated 	 	;	she	'd	blow	 bubble 	 s 	 	in	my	face	.
She	would	,	I	think	,	let	me	know	that	I	was	going	to	 starv 	 e 	 	.
But	yet	she	did	n't	stop	.
She	would	not	stop	 try 	 ing 	 	to	feed	me	 penguin 	 s 	 	.
And	on	the	last	day	with	 th 	 is 	 	female	where	I	thought	I	had	 push 	 ed 	 	her	too	far	,	I	got	nervous	 be 	 cause 	 	she	came	up	to	me	,	she	 roll 	 ed 	 	over	on	her	back	,	and	she	did	 th 	 is 	 	deep	,	 gutt 	 ural 	 	 jack 	 hammer 	 	sound	,	 th 	 is 	 	 gokgok 	 gokgok 	 	.
And	I	thought	,	she	's	about	to	bite	.
She	's	about	to	let	me	know	she	's	too	 frust 	 rated 	 	with	me	.
What	had	 happen 	 ed 	 	was	 an 	 other 	 	seal	had	snuck	in	 be 	 hind 	 	me	,	and	she	did	that	to	threat	 dis 	 play 	 	.
She	 chase 	 d 	 	that	big	seal	away	,	went	and	got	 it 	 s 	 	penguin	and	 br 	 ought 	 	it	to	me	.
That	was	n't	the	 on 	 ly 	 	seal	I	got	in	the	water	with	.
I	got	in	the	water	with	30	other	leopard	 seal 	 s 	 	,	and	I	never	once	had	a	 scar 	 y 	 	 en 	 counter 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	are	the	most	 remark 	 able 	 	 animal 	 s 	 	I	've	ever	 work 	 ed 	 	with	,	and	the	same	with	polar	 bear 	 s 	 	.
And	just	like	the	polar	 bear 	 s 	 	,	these	 animal 	 s 	 	depend	on	an	 ic 	 y 	 	environment	.
I	get	 emotion 	 al 	 	.	 So 	 rry 	 	.
It	's	a	story	that	 live 	 s 	 	deep	in	my	heart	,	and	I	'm	proud	to	share	 th 	 is 	 	with	you	.
And	I	'm	so	passionate	about	it	.
 Any 	 body 	 	want	to	come	with	me	to	 Antarctic 	 a 	 	or	the	 Arc 	 tic 	 	,	I	'll	take	you	;	let	's	go	.
We	've	got	to	get	the	story	out	now	.	Thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
Thank	you	.
Thank	you	.

 Julia 	 n 	 	 Tre 	 asure 	 	:	 Sh 	 h 	 	!	Sound	health	in	8	 step 	 s 	 
The	 Hindu 	 s 	 	say	,	``	 Nad 	 a 	 	brahma	,	''	one	 transl 	 ation 	 	of	which	is	,	``	The	world	is	sound	.	''
And	in	a	way	,	that	's	true	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	is	 vib 	 rating 	 	.
In	fact	,	all	of	you	 a 	 s 	 	you	 s 	 it 	 	here	right	now	are	 vib 	 rating 	 	.
Every	part	of	your	body	is	 vib 	 rating 	 	at	different	 fr 	 equ 	 encies 	 	.
So	you	are	,	in	fact	,	a	 chor 	 d 	 	--	each	of	you	an	individual	 chor 	 d 	 	.
One	definition	of	health	may	be	that	that	 chor 	 d 	 	is	in	complete	 harmon 	 y 	 	.
Your	 ear 	 s 	 	ca	n't	hear	that	 chor 	 d 	 	;	they	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	hear	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.	Your	 ear 	 s 	 	can	hear	10	 octave 	 s 	 	.
 Inc 	 ident 	 ally 	 	,	we	see	just	one	octave	.
Your	 ear 	 s 	 	are	 al 	 ways 	 	on	--	you	have	no	ear	lids	.
 The 	 y 	 	work	even	when	you	sleep	.
The	 small 	 est 	 	sound	you	can	perceive	 move 	 s 	 	your	 ear 	 drum 	 	just	four	atomic	 dia 	 meter 	 s 	 	.
The	 loud 	 est 	 	sound	you	can	hear	is	a	trillion	 time 	 s 	 	more	 power 	 ful 	 	than	that	.
 Ear 	 s 	 	are	made	not	for	 hear 	 ing 	 	,	but	for	 listen 	 ing 	 	.
 Listen 	 ing 	 	is	an	active	skill	,	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	 hear 	 ing 	 	is	 pass 	 ive 	 	,	 listen 	 ing 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	have	to	work	at	--	it	's	a	relationship	with	sound	.
And	yet	it	's	a	skill	that	 non 	 e 	 	of	us	are	taught	.
For	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	have	you	ever	 consider 	 ed 	 	that	there	are	 listen 	 ing 	 	 position 	 s 	 	,	 place 	 s 	 	you	can	listen	from	?
 He 	 re 	 	are	two	of	them	.
 Re 	 duct 	 ive 	 	 listen 	 ing 	 	is	 listen 	 ing 	 	``	for	.	''
It	 reduc 	 es 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	down	to	what	's	relevant	and	it	 dis 	 card 	 s 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	that	's	not	relevant	.
Men	 typical 	 ly 	 	listen	 re 	 duct 	 ively 	 	.
So	he	's	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	I	've	got	 th 	 is 	 	problem	.	''
He	's	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	 He 	 re 	 	's	your	solution	.	 Thank 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.	Next	.	''
That	's	the	way	we	talk	,	right	 guy 	 s 	 	?
 Ex 	 pan 	 s 	 ive 	 	 listen 	 ing 	 	,	on	the	other	hand	,	is	 listen 	 ing 	 	``	with	,	''	not	 listen 	 ing 	 	``	for	.	''
It	's	got	no	destination	in	mind	--	it	's	just	 enjoy 	 ing 	 	the	journey	.
Women	 typical 	 ly 	 	listen	 expansive 	 ly 	 	.
If	you	look	at	these	two	,	eye	contact	,	facing	each	other	,	possibly	both	 talk 	 ing 	 	at	the	same	time	.
Men	,	if	you	get	 noth 	 ing 	 	else	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	talk	,	practice	expansive	 listen 	 ing 	 	,	and	you	can	transform	your	 relationship 	 s 	 	.
The	trouble	with	 listen 	 ing 	 	is	that	so	much	of	what	we	hear	is	noise	,	 surround 	 ing 	 	us	all	the	time	.
 No 	 ise 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	 accord 	 ing 	 	to	the	European	 Un 	 ion 	 	,	is	 reduc 	 ing 	 	the	health	and	the	quality	of	life	of	25	percent	of	the	population	of	 Euro 	 pe 	 	.
Two	percent	of	the	population	of	 Euro 	 pe 	 	--	that	's	16	million	people	--	are	 hav 	 ing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	sleep	 deva 	 state 	 d 	 	by	noise	like	that	.
200,000	people	a	year	in	 Euro 	 pe 	 	.
It	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	big	problem	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	when	you	 we 	 re 	 	little	,	if	you	had	noise	and	you	did	n't	want	to	hear	it	,	you	'd	stick	your	 finger 	 s 	 	in	your	 ear 	 s 	 	and	hum	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	 day 	 s 	 	,	you	can	do	a	similar	thing	,	it	just	 look 	 s 	 	a	bit	 cool 	 er 	 	.
It	 look 	 s 	 	a	bit	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
The	trouble	with	 wide 	 spread 	 	 head 	 phone 	 	use	is	it	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	three	 re 	 ally 	 	big	health	 issue 	 s 	 	.
The	first	 re 	 ally 	 	big	health	issue	is	a	word	that	 Mur 	 ray 	 	 Sch 	 af 	 er 	 	 co 	 in 	 ed 	 	:	It	's	a	 dis 	 location 	 	between	what	you	see	and	what	you	hear	.
So	,	we	're	 invit 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	our	 live 	 s 	 	the	 voice 	 s 	 	of	people	who	are	not	present	with	us	.
I	think	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	 deep 	 ly 	 	 un 	 health 	 y 	 	about	living	all	the	time	in	 schizo 	 phon 	 ia 	 	.
The	second	problem	that	 come 	 s 	 	with	 head 	 phone 	 	abuse	is	 compress 	 ion 	 	.
We	squash	music	to	fit	it	 in 	 to 	 	our	pocket	and	there	is	a	cost	 attach 	 ed 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	.
Listen	to	 th 	 is 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 un 	 compress 	 ed 	 	piece	of	music	.
And	now	the	same	piece	of	music	with	98	percent	of	the	data	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	.
I	do	hope	that	some	of	you	at	 l 	 east 	 	can	hear	the	 differ 	 ence 	 	between	 t 	 hose 	 	two	.
There	is	a	cost	of	 compress 	 ion 	 	.
It	 make 	 s 	 	you	 tire 	 d 	 	and	 irrit 	 able 	 	to	have	to	make	up	all	of	that	data	.
You	're	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	imagine	it	.
It	's	not	good	for	you	in	the	long	run	.
The	third	problem	with	 head 	 phone 	 s 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	:	 deaf 	 ness 	 	--	 noise 	 - 	 induced 	 	 hear 	 ing 	 	 dis 	 order 	 	.
Ten	million	 American 	 s 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	have	 th 	 is 	 	for	one	reason	or	 an 	 other 	 	,	but	 re 	 ally 	 	 worry 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	16	percent	--	 rough 	 ly 	 	one	in	six	--	of	American	 teenager 	 s 	 	suffer	from	 noise 	 - 	 induced 	 	 hear 	 ing 	 	 dis 	 order 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	of	 head 	 phone 	 	abuse	.
One	 stud 	 y 	 	at	an	American	university	found	that	61	percent	of	college	 fresh 	 men 	 	had	 damage 	 d 	 	 hear 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	result	of	 head 	 phone 	 	abuse	.
We	may	be	raising	an	entire	generation	of	deaf	people	.
 N 	 ow 	 	that	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	serious	problem	.
I	'll	give	you	three	quick	 tip 	 s 	 	to	protect	your	 ear 	 s 	 	and	pass	these	on	to	your	children	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	.
 Profess 	 ional 	 	 hear 	 ing 	 	 protect 	 ors 	 	are	great	;	I	use	some	all	the	time	.
If	you	're	going	to	use	 head 	 phone 	 s 	 	,	buy	the	best	 one 	 s 	 	you	can	afford	 be 	 cause 	 	quality	 mean 	 s 	 	you	do	n't	have	to	have	it	so	loud	.
If	you	ca	n't	hear	 some 	 body 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	you	in	a	loud	voice	,	it	's	too	loud	.
And	 third 	 ly 	 	,	if	you	're	in	bad	sound	,	it	's	fine	to	put	your	 finger 	 s 	 	in	your	 ear 	 s 	 	or	just	move	away	from	it	.
Protect	your	 ear 	 s 	 	in	that	way	.
Let	's	move	away	from	bad	sound	and	look	at	some	 friend 	 s 	 	that	I	urge	you	to	seek	out	.
 WW 	 B 	 	:	Wind	,	water	,	 bird 	 s 	 	--	 stochas 	 tic 	 	natural	 sound 	 s 	 	 compose 	 d 	 	of	 lot 	 s 	 	of	individual	random	 event 	 s 	 	,	all	of	it	 ver 	 y 	 	 health 	 y 	 	,	all	of	it	sound	that	we	 evolv 	 ed 	 	to	over	the	 year 	 s 	 	.
Seek	 t 	 hose 	 	 sound 	 s 	 	out	;	they	're	good	for	you	and	so	it	 th 	 is 	 	.
 Sil 	 ence 	 	is	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
The	 Elizabeth 	 an 	 s 	 	 de 	 scribed 	 	language	 a 	 s 	 	 decor 	 ated 	 	silence	.
I	urge	you	to	move	away	from	silence	with	 intent 	 ion 	 	and	to	design	 sound 	 scapes 	 	just	like	 work 	 s 	 	of	art	.
 Hav 	 e 	 	a	 fore 	 ground 	 	,	a	 back 	 ground 	 	,	all	in	 beaut 	 iful 	 	proportion	.
It	's	 f 	 un 	 	to	get	 in 	 to 	 	 design 	 ing 	 	with	sound	.
If	you	ca	n't	do	it	 your 	 self 	 	,	get	a	professional	to	do	it	for	you	.
Sound	design	is	the	future	,	and	I	think	it	's	the	way	we	're	going	to	change	the	way	the	world	 sound 	 s 	 	.
I	'm	going	to	just	run	 quick 	 ly 	 	through	eight	 mod 	 al 	 ities 	 	,	eight	ways	sound	can	improve	health	.
First	,	 ultra 	 sound 	 	:	we	're	 ver 	 y 	 	familiar	with	it	from	physical	therapy	;	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	now	 be 	 ing 	 	used	to	treat	cancer	.
Lithotripsy	--	saving	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	people	a	year	from	the	 scalp 	 el 	 	by	 pul 	 ver 	 izing 	 	 stone 	 s 	 	with	 high 	 - 	 intens 	 ity 	 	sound	.
Sound	 heal 	 ing 	 	is	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 mod 	 ality 	 	.
It	's	 be 	 en 	 	around	for	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	.
I	do	urge	you	to	explore	 th 	 is 	 	.
There	are	great	 thing 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	 d 	 one 	 	there	,	 treat 	 ing 	 	now	 aut 	 ism 	 	,	 de 	 ment 	 ia 	 	and	other	 condition 	 s 	 	.
And	music	,	of	course	.	Just	 listen 	 ing 	 	to	music	is	good	for	you	,	if	it	's	music	that	's	made	with	good	 intent 	 ion 	 	,	made	with	love	,	 general 	 ly 	 	.
 De 	 vot 	 ional 	 	music	,	good	--	 Mo 	 z 	 art 	 	,	good	.
There	are	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 type 	 s 	 	of	music	that	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 health 	 y 	 	.
And	four	 mod 	 al 	 ities 	 	where	you	need	to	take	some	action	and	get	 involve 	 d 	 	.
First	of	all	,	listen	 conscious 	 ly 	 	.
I	hope	that	that	after	 th 	 is 	 	talk	you	'll	be	 do 	 ing 	 	that	.
It	's	a	whole	new	dimension	to	your	life	and	it	's	 wonder 	 ful 	 	to	have	that	dimension	.
 Second 	 ly 	 	,	get	in	touch	with	making	some	sound	--	create	sound	.
The	voice	is	the	instrument	we	all	play	,	and	yet	how	 man 	 y 	 	of	us	are	trained	in	using	our	voice	?	Get	trained	;	learn	to	 s 	 ing 	 	,	learn	to	play	an	instrument	.
 Music 	 ians 	 	have	 big 	 ger 	 	 brain 	 s 	 	--	it	's	true	.
You	can	do	 th 	 is 	 	in	 group 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
It	's	a	fantastic	antidote	to	 schizo 	 phon 	 ia 	 	;	to	make	music	and	sound	in	a	group	of	people	,	 which 	 ever 	 	style	you	enjoy	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	.
And	let	's	take	a	 steward 	 ing 	 	role	for	the	sound	around	us	.
Protect	your	 ear 	 s 	 	?	Yes	,	 absolute 	 ly 	 	.
Design	 sound 	 scapes 	 	to	be	 beaut 	 iful 	 	around	you	at	home	and	at	work	.
And	let	's	start	to	speak	up	when	people	are	 ass 	 ailing 	 	us	with	the	noise	that	I	 play 	 ed 	 	you	early	on	.
So	I	'm	going	to	 leav 	 e 	 	you	with	seven	 thing 	 s 	 	you	can	do	right	now	to	improve	your	health	with	sound	.
My	vision	is	of	a	world	that	 sound 	 s 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	and	if	we	all	start	 do 	 ing 	 	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	we	will	take	a	 ver 	 y 	 	big	step	in	that	direction	.
So	I	urge	you	to	take	that	path	.
I	'm	 leav 	 ing 	 	you	with	a	little	more	 bird 	 song 	 	,	which	is	 ver 	 y 	 	good	for	you	.
I	wish	you	sound	health	.

We	think	of	space	 a 	 s 	 	a	silent	place	.	But	physicist	 Jan 	 na 	 	 Lev 	 in 	 	 say 	 s 	 	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 sound 	 track 	 	--	a	sonic	 com 	 position 	 	that	 record 	 s 	 	some	of	the	most	 dramat 	 ic 	 	 event 	 s 	 	in	 out 	 er 	 	space	.

 Jan 	 na 	 	 Lev 	 in 	 	:	The	sound	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 make 	 s 	 
I	want	to	ask	you	all	to	consider	for	a	second	the	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	fact	that	,	by	far	,	most	of	what	we	know	about	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 come 	 s 	 	to	us	from	light	.
We	can	stand	on	the	Earth	and	look	up	at	the	night	sky	and	see	 star 	 s 	 	with	our	bare	 eye 	 s 	 	.
The	Sun	 burn 	 s 	 	our	 per 	 iph 	 er 	 al 	 	vision	.
We	see	light	 reflect 	 ed 	 	off	the	 Mo 	 on 	 	.
And	in	the	time	since	 Gal 	 ile 	 o 	 	 point 	 ed 	 	that	 rud 	 imentary 	 	 tele 	 scope 	 	at	the	 ce 	 les 	 tial 	 	bodies	,	the	known	 uni 	 verse 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	come	to	us	through	light	,	 a 	 cross 	 	vast	 era 	 s 	 	in	 cosm 	 ic 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
And	with	all	of	our	modern	 tele 	 scope 	 s 	 	,	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	collect	 th 	 is 	 	 stunn 	 ing 	 	silent	movie	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	--	these	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 snap 	 shot 	 s 	 	that	go	all	the	way	back	to	the	Big	Bang	.
And	yet	,	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	not	a	silent	movie	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	n't	silent	.
I	'd	like	to	 con 	 vince 	 	you	that	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 sound 	 track 	 	and	that	 sound 	 track 	 	is	 play 	 ed 	 	on	space	 it 	 self 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	space	can	 wo 	 bble 	 	like	a	drum	.
It	can	ring	out	a	kind	of	 record 	 ing 	 	 through 	 out 	 	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	of	some	of	the	most	 dramat 	 ic 	 	 event 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	 un 	 fold 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	we	'd	like	to	be	able	to	add	to	a	kind	of	 glor 	 ious 	 	visual	 com 	 position 	 	that	we	have	of	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	--	a	sonic	 com 	 position 	 	.
And	while	we	've	never	heard	the	 sound 	 s 	 	from	space	,	we	 re 	 ally 	 	should	,	in	the	next	few	 year 	 s 	 	,	start	to	turn	up	the	volume	on	what	's	going	on	out	there	.
So	in	 th 	 is 	 	 ambit 	 ion 	 	to	capture	 song 	 s 	 	from	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	we	turn	our	focus	to	black	 hole 	 s 	 	and	the	promise	they	have	,	 be 	 cause 	 	black	 hole 	 s 	 	can	bang	on	 space 	 - 	 time 	 	like	 mal 	 lets 	 	on	a	drum	and	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 character 	 istic 	 	song	,	which	I	'd	like	to	play	for	you	--	some	of	our	 predict 	 ions 	 	for	what	that	song	will	be	like	.
 N 	 ow 	 	black	 hole 	 s 	 	are	dark	against	a	dark	sky	.
We	ca	n't	see	them	 direct 	 ly 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	not	 br 	 ought 	 	to	us	with	light	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	not	 direct 	 ly 	 	.
We	can	see	them	 in 	 direct 	 ly 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	black	 hole 	 s 	 	wreak	 ha 	 voc 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	environment	.
 The 	 y 	 	destroy	 star 	 s 	 	around	them	.
 The 	 y 	 	churn	up	 deb 	 ris 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 surround 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
But	they	wo	n't	come	to	us	 direct 	 ly 	 	through	light	.
We	might	one	day	see	a	shadow	a	black	hole	can	cast	on	a	 ver 	 y 	 	bright	 back 	 ground 	 	,	but	we	have	n't	yet	.
And	yet	black	 hole 	 s 	 	may	be	heard	even	if	they	're	not	 s 	 een 	 	,	and	that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	they	bang	on	 space 	 - 	 time 	 	like	a	drum	.
 N 	 ow 	 	we	owe	the	idea	that	space	can	ring	like	a	drum	to	 Al 	 bert 	 	Einstein	--	to	whom	we	owe	so	much	.
Einstein	 real 	 ized 	 	that	if	space	 we 	 re 	 	empty	,	if	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 we 	 re 	 	empty	,	it	would	be	like	 th 	 is 	 	picture	,	 ex 	 cept 	 	for	 may 	 be 	 	 with 	 out 	 	the	 help 	 ful 	 	grid	drawn	on	it	.
But	if	we	 we 	 re 	 	 free 	 ly 	 	 fall 	 ing 	 	through	the	space	,	even	 with 	 out 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 help 	 ful 	 	grid	,	we	might	be	able	to	paint	it	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	would	notice	that	we	 travel 	 ed 	 	 a 	 long 	 	straight	lines	,	 un 	 deflect 	 ed 	 	straight	 path 	 s 	 	through	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
Einstein	 al 	 so 	 	 real 	 ized 	 	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	real	meat	of	the	matter	--	that	if	you	put	energy	or	mass	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	it	would	 curv 	 e 	 	space	,	and	a	 free 	 ly 	 	 fall 	 ing 	 	object	would	pass	by	,	let	's	say	,	the	Sun	and	it	would	be	 deflect 	 ed 	 	 a 	 long 	 	the	natural	 curv 	 es 	 	in	the	space	.
It	was	Einstein	's	great	general	 theor 	 y 	 	of	 relat 	 ivity 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	even	light	will	be	bent	by	 t 	 hose 	 	 path 	 s 	 	.
And	you	can	be	bent	so	much	that	you	're	caught	in	orbit	around	the	Sun	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	Earth	is	,	or	the	 Mo 	 on 	 	around	the	Earth	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	the	natural	 curv 	 es 	 	in	space	.
What	Einstein	did	not	 real 	 ize 	 	was	that	,	if	you	took	our	Sun	and	you	 crush 	 ed 	 	it	down	to	six	 kilometer 	 s 	 	--	so	you	took	a	million	 time 	 s 	 	the	mass	of	the	Earth	and	you	 crush 	 ed 	 	it	to	six	 kilometer 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	,	you	would	make	a	black	hole	,	an	object	so	dense	that	if	light	 veer 	 ed 	 	too	close	,	it	would	never	 es 	 cape 	 	--	a	dark	shadow	against	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
It	was	n't	Einstein	who	 real 	 ized 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	it	was	Karl	 Sch 	 war 	 z 	 s 	 child 	 	who	was	a	German	Jew	in	World	War	I	--	 join 	 ed 	 	the	German	 arm 	 y 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	an	 accomplish 	 ed 	 	scientist	,	 work 	 ing 	 	on	the	 Russia 	 n 	 	front	.
I	like	to	imagine	 Sch 	 war 	 z 	 s 	 child 	 	in	the	war	in	the	 trench 	 es 	 	 calcul 	 ating 	 	 ball 	 istic 	 	 tra 	 ject 	 ories 	 	for	 can 	 non 	 	fire	,	and	then	,	in	between	,	 calcul 	 ating 	 	Einstein	's	 equ 	 ations 	 	--	 a 	 s 	 	you	do	in	the	 trench 	 es 	 	.
And	he	was	 read 	 ing 	 	Einstein	's	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	 publish 	 ed 	 	general	 theor 	 y 	 	of	 relat 	 ivity 	 	,	and	he	was	 thrill 	 ed 	 	by	 th 	 is 	 	 theor 	 y 	 	.
And	he	 quick 	 ly 	 	 sur 	 mis 	 ed 	 	an	exact	 mathematic 	 al 	 	solution	that	 de 	 scribed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	:	 curv 	 es 	 	so	strong	that	space	would	rain	down	 in 	 to 	 	them	,	space	 it 	 self 	 	would	 curv 	 e 	 	like	a	 water 	 fall 	 	 flow 	 ing 	 	down	the	throat	of	a	hole	.
And	even	light	could	not	 es 	 cape 	 	 th 	 is 	 	current	.
Light	would	be	 drag 	 ged 	 	down	the	hole	 a 	 s 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	else	would	be	,	and	all	that	would	be	left	would	be	a	shadow	.
 N 	 ow 	 	he	wrote	to	Einstein	,	and	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 A 	 s 	 	you	will	see	,	the	war	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	kind	to	me	 en 	 ough 	 	.
 De 	 spite 	 	the	heavy	 gun 	 fire 	 	,	I	've	 be 	 en 	 	able	to	get	away	from	it	all	and	walk	through	the	land	of	your	 idea 	 s 	 	.	''
And	Einstein	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 impress 	 ed 	 	with	his	exact	solution	,	and	I	should	hope	 al 	 so 	 	the	 d 	 ed 	 ic 	 ation 	 	of	the	scientist	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	 hard 	 work 	 ing 	 	scientist	under	harsh	 condition 	 s 	 	.
And	he	took	 Sch 	 war 	 z 	 s 	 child 	 	's	idea	to	the	 Prussia 	 n 	 	Academy	of	 Science 	 s 	 	the	next	week	.
But	Einstein	 al 	 ways 	 	thought	black	 hole 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	a	 mathematic 	 al 	 	 odd 	 ity 	 	.
He	did	not	 believ 	 e 	 	they	 exist 	 ed 	 	in	nature	.
He	thought	nature	would	protect	us	from	 the 	 ir 	 	 form 	 ation 	 	.
It	was	 decade 	 s 	 	before	the	term	``	black	hole	''	was	 co 	 in 	 ed 	 	and	people	 real 	 ized 	 	that	black	 hole 	 s 	 	are	real	 astro 	 physical 	 	 object 	 s 	 	--	in	fact	they	're	the	death	state	of	 ver 	 y 	 	massive	 star 	 s 	 	that	collapse	 catastroph 	 ically 	 	at	the	end	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 life 	 time 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	our	Sun	will	not	collapse	to	a	black	hole	.
It	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	not	massive	 en 	 ough 	 	.
But	if	we	did	a	little	thought	experiment	--	 a 	 s 	 	Einstein	was	 ver 	 y 	 	fond	of	 do 	 ing 	 	--	we	could	imagine	 put 	 ting 	 	the	Sun	 crush 	 ed 	 	down	to	six	 kilometer 	 s 	 	,	and	 put 	 ting 	 	a	 tin 	 y 	 	little	Earth	around	it	in	orbit	,	 may 	 be 	 	30	 kilometer 	 s 	 	 out 	 side 	 	of	the	 black 	 - 	 hole 	 	 s 	 un 	 	.
And	it	would	be	 self 	 - 	 illuminate 	 d 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	now	the	Sun	's	gone	,	we	have	no	other	source	of	light	--	so	let	's	make	our	little	Earth	 self 	 - 	 illuminate 	 d 	 	.
And	you	would	 real 	 ize 	 	you	could	put	the	Earth	in	a	happy	orbit	even	30	km	 out 	 side 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 crush 	 ed 	 	black	hole	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 crush 	 ed 	 	black	hole	 actual 	 ly 	 	would	fit	 in 	 side 	 	 Man 	 hat 	 tan 	 	,	more	or	less	.
It	might	 s 	 pill 	 	off	 in 	 to 	 	the	 Hu 	 d 	 son 	 	a	little	bit	before	it	 destroy 	 ed 	 	the	Earth	.
But	 bas 	 ically 	 	that	's	what	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	.
We	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	an	object	that	you	could	crush	down	to	half	the	square	area	of	 Man 	 hat 	 tan 	 	.
So	we	move	 th 	 is 	 	Earth	 ver 	 y 	 	close	--	30	 kilometer 	 s 	 	 out 	 side 	 	--	and	we	notice	it	's	 perfect 	 ly 	 	fine	 orbit 	 ing 	 	around	the	black	hole	.
There	's	a	sort	of	myth	that	black	 hole 	 s 	 	devour	 every 	 thing 	 	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	but	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	have	to	get	 ver 	 y 	 	close	to	fall	in	.
But	what	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 impress 	 ive 	 	is	that	,	from	our	 van 	 t 	 age 	 	point	,	we	can	 al 	 ways 	 	see	the	Earth	.
It	can	not	hide	 be 	 hind 	 	the	black	hole	.
The	light	from	the	Earth	,	some	of	it	 fall 	 s 	 	in	,	but	some	of	it	 get 	 s 	 	 lens 	 ed 	 	around	and	 br 	 ought 	 	back	to	us	.
So	you	ca	n't	hide	 any 	 thing 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	a	black	hole	.
If	 th 	 is 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 Battle 	 star 	 	 Galactic 	 a 	 	and	you	're	 fight 	 ing 	 	the	 Cy 	 lon 	 s 	 	,	do	n't	hide	 be 	 hind 	 	the	black	hole	.
 The 	 y 	 	can	see	you	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	our	Sun	will	not	collapse	to	a	black	hole	--	it	's	not	massive	 en 	 ough 	 	--	but	there	are	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	black	 hole 	 s 	 	in	our	 galax 	 y 	 	.
And	if	one	 we 	 re 	 	to	eclipse	the	 Mil 	 ky 	 	Way	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	it	would	look	like	.
We	would	see	a	shadow	of	that	black	hole	against	the	hundred	billion	 star 	 s 	 	in	the	 Mil 	 ky 	 	Way	 Galax 	 y 	 	and	 it 	 s 	 	 lumin 	 ous 	 	dust	 lane 	 s 	 	.
And	if	we	 we 	 re 	 	to	fall	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	black	hole	,	we	would	see	all	of	that	light	 lens 	 ed 	 	around	it	,	and	we	could	even	start	to	cross	 in 	 to 	 	that	shadow	and	 re 	 ally 	 	not	notice	that	 any 	 thing 	 	 dramat 	 ic 	 	had	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
It	would	be	bad	if	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	fire	our	 rocket 	 s 	 	and	get	out	of	there	 be 	 cause 	 	we	could	n't	,	 any 	 more 	 	than	light	can	 es 	 cape 	 	.
But	even	 th 	 ough 	 	the	black	hole	is	dark	from	the	 out 	 side 	 	,	it	's	not	dark	on	the	 in 	 side 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	all	of	the	light	from	the	 galax 	 y 	 	can	fall	in	 be 	 hind 	 	us	.
And	even	 th 	 ough 	 	,	due	to	a	 relat 	 iv 	 istic 	 	effect	known	 a 	 s 	 	time	 dil 	 ation 	 	,	our	 clock 	 s 	 	would	seem	to	 s 	 low 	 	down	 relat 	 ive 	 	to	galactic	time	,	it	would	look	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	the	evolution	of	the	 galax 	 y 	 	had	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 ped 	 	up	and	shot	at	us	,	right	before	we	 we 	 re 	 	 crush 	 ed 	 	to	death	by	the	black	hole	.
It	would	be	like	a	 near 	 - 	 death 	 	experience	where	you	see	the	light	at	the	end	of	the	tunnel	,	but	it	's	a	total	death	experience	.
And	there	's	no	way	of	 tell 	 ing 	 	 any 	 body 	 	about	the	light	at	the	end	of	the	tunnel	.
 N 	 ow 	 	we	've	never	 s 	 een 	 	a	shadow	like	 th 	 is 	 	of	a	black	hole	,	but	black	 hole 	 s 	 	can	be	heard	,	even	if	they	're	not	 s 	 een 	 	.
 Imagin 	 e 	 	now	taking	an	 astro 	 physical 	 ly 	 	realistic	 situ 	 ation 	 	--	imagine	two	black	 hole 	 s 	 	that	have	lived	a	long	life	together	.
 May 	 be 	 	they	 start 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 star 	 s 	 	and	 collapse 	 d 	 	to	two	black	 hole 	 s 	 	--	each	one	10	 time 	 s 	 	the	mass	of	the	Sun	.
So	now	we	're	going	to	crush	them	down	to	60	 kilometer 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	can	be	 s 	 pinning 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 time 	 s 	 	a	second	.
At	the	end	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	,	they	're	going	around	each	other	 ver 	 y 	 	near	the	speed	of	light	.
So	they	're	 cross 	 ing 	 	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 kilometer 	 s 	 	in	a	fraction	of	a	second	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	they	do	so	,	they	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 curv 	 e 	 	space	,	but	they	 leav 	 e 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	wake	a	 ring 	 ing 	 	of	space	,	an	actual	wave	on	 space 	 - 	 time 	 	.
Space	 squeez 	 es 	 	and	 stretch 	 es 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	 emanate 	 s 	 	out	from	these	black	 hole 	 s 	 	 bang 	 ing 	 	on	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
And	they	travel	out	 in 	 to 	 	the	 cosmo 	 s 	 	at	the	speed	of	light	.
 Th 	 is 	 	computer	 simul 	 ation 	 	is	due	to	a	 relat 	 ivity 	 	group	at	 NAS 	 A 	 	 God 	 d 	 ard 	 	.
It	took	 al 	 most 	 	30	 year 	 s 	 	for	 any 	 one 	 	in	the	world	to	crack	 th 	 is 	 	problem	.
 Th 	 is 	 	was	one	of	the	 group 	 s 	 	.

And	if	you	can	see	--	it	's	kind	of	faint	--	but	if	you	can	see	the	red	 wave 	 s 	 	 e 	 man 	 ating 	 	out	,	 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	 gravit 	 ation 	 al 	 	 wave 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	 liter 	 ally 	 	the	 sound 	 s 	 	of	space	 ring 	 ing 	 	,	and	they	will	travel	out	from	these	black	 hole 	 s 	 	at	the	speed	of	light	 a 	 s 	 	they	ring	down	and	coalesce	to	one	 s 	 pinning 	 	,	quiet	black	hole	at	the	end	of	the	day	.
If	you	 we 	 re 	 	 stand 	 ing 	 	near	 en 	 ough 	 	,	your	ear	would	 reson 	 ate 	 	with	the	 squeez 	 ing 	 	and	 stretch 	 ing 	 	of	space	.
You	would	 liter 	 ally 	 	hear	the	sound	.
 N 	 ow 	 	of	course	,	your	head	would	be	 squeez 	 ed 	 	and	 stretch 	 ed 	 	 un 	 help 	 fully 	 	,	so	you	might	have	trouble	 understand 	 ing 	 	what	's	going	on	.
But	I	'd	like	to	play	for	you	the	sound	that	we	predict	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	from	my	group	--	a	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	less	 glamor 	 ous 	 	computer	 model 	 ing 	 	.
 Imagin 	 e 	 	a	 light 	 er 	 	black	hole	 fall 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	heavy	black	hole	.
The	sound	you	're	 hear 	 ing 	 	is	the	light	black	hole	 bang 	 ing 	 	on	space	each	time	it	 get 	 s 	 	close	.
If	it	 get 	 s 	 	far	away	,	it	's	a	little	too	quiet	.
But	it	 come 	 s 	 	in	like	a	 malle 	 t 	 	,	and	it	 liter 	 ally 	 	 crack 	 s 	 	space	,	 wo 	 b 	 bling 	 	it	like	a	drum	.
And	we	can	predict	what	the	sound	will	be	.
We	know	that	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 fall 	 s 	 	in	,	it	 get 	 s 	 	 fast 	 er 	 	and	it	 get 	 s 	 	 loud 	 er 	 	.
And	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	we	're	going	to	hear	the	little	guy	just	fall	 in 	 to 	 	the	 big 	 ger 	 	guy	.
 Th 	 en 	 	it	's	gone	.
 N 	 ow 	 	I	've	never	heard	it	that	loud	--	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	more	 dramat 	 ic 	 	.
At	home	it	 sound 	 s 	 	kind	of	 antic 	 lim 	 act 	 ic 	 	.
It	's	sort	of	like	 d 	 ing 	 	,	 d 	 ing 	 	,	 d 	 ing 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	sound	from	my	group	.
No	,	I	'm	not	 show 	 ing 	 	you	any	 image 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	black	 hole 	 s 	 	do	n't	 leav 	 e 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	 help 	 ful 	 	 trail 	 s 	 	of	ink	,	and	space	is	not	 paint 	 ed 	 	,	 show 	 ing 	 	you	the	 curv 	 es 	 	.
But	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	to	float	by	in	space	on	a	space	 holi 	 day 	 	and	you	heard	 th 	 is 	 	,	you	want	to	get	moving	.
 W 	 ant 	 	to	get	away	from	the	sound	.
 Bo 	 th 	 	black	 hole 	 s 	 	are	moving	.
 Bo 	 th 	 	black	 hole 	 s 	 	are	 get 	 ting 	 	 close 	 r 	 	together	.
In	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	they	're	both	 wo 	 b 	 bling 	 	 quit 	 e 	 	a	lot	.
And	then	they	're	going	to	merge	.
 N 	 ow 	 	it	's	gone	.

There	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	mission	 pro 	 posed 	 	for	space	,	which	 hope 	 fully 	 	will	launch	in	the	next	ten	 year 	 s 	 	,	 call 	 ed 	 	 LI 	 SA 	 	.
And	 LI 	 SA 	 	will	be	able	to	see	 super 	 - 	 massive 	 	black	 hole 	 s 	 	--	black	 hole 	 s 	 	 million 	 s 	 	or	 billion 	 s 	 	of	 time 	 s 	 	the	mass	of	the	Sun	.
In	 th 	 is 	 	 Hu 	 bble 	 	image	,	we	see	two	 galax 	 ies 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	look	like	they	're	 froze 	 n 	 	in	some	embrace	.
And	each	one	 prob 	 ably 	 	 harbor 	 s 	 	a	 super 	 - 	 massive 	 	black	hole	at	 it 	 s 	 	core	.
But	they	're	not	 froze 	 n 	 	;	they	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 mer 	 ging 	 	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	two	black	 hole 	 s 	 	are	 coll 	 id 	 ing 	 	,	and	they	will	merge	over	a	 billion 	 - 	 year 	 	time	scale	.
It	's	beyond	our	human	 per 	 ception 	 	to	pick	up	a	song	of	that	 dur 	 ation 	 	.
But	 LI 	 SA 	 	could	see	the	final	 stage 	 s 	 	of	two	 super 	 - 	 massive 	 	black	 hole 	 s 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	's	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	the	last	15	 minute 	 s 	 	before	they	fall	together	.
And	it	's	not	just	black	 hole 	 s 	 	,	but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	any	big	 disturb 	 ance 	 	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	--	and	the	 big 	 gest 	 	of	them	all	is	the	Big	Bang	.
When	that	 express 	 ion 	 	was	 co 	 in 	 ed 	 	,	it	was	 deris 	 ive 	 	--	like	,	``	Oh	,	who	would	 believ 	 e 	 	in	a	Big	Bang	?	''
But	now	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	might	be	more	 technical 	 ly 	 	accurate	 be 	 cause 	 	it	might	bang	.
It	might	make	a	sound	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 anim 	 ation 	 	from	my	 friend 	 s 	 	at	 Pro 	 ton 	 	 Studio 	 s 	 	 show 	 s 	 	looking	at	the	Big	Bang	from	the	 out 	 side 	 	.
We	do	n't	ever	want	to	do	that	 actual 	 ly 	 	.	We	want	to	be	 in 	 side 	 	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	no	 s 	 uch 	 	thing	 a 	 s 	 	 stand 	 ing 	 	 out 	 side 	 	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
So	imagine	you	're	 in 	 side 	 	the	Big	Bang	.
It	's	 every 	 where 	 	,	it	's	all	around	you	,	and	the	space	is	 wo 	 b 	 bling 	 	 chaotic 	 ally 	 	.
 Four 	 teen 	 	billion	 year 	 s 	 	pass	and	 th 	 is 	 	song	is	still	 ring 	 ing 	 	all	around	us	.
 Galax 	 ies 	 	form	,	and	 generation 	 s 	 	of	 star 	 s 	 	form	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 galax 	 ies 	 	,	and	around	one	star	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	one	star	,	is	a	 habit 	 able 	 	planet	.
And	here	we	are	 fr 	 ant 	 ically 	 	building	these	 experiment 	 s 	 	,	 do 	 ing 	 	these	 calcul 	 ations 	 	,	writing	these	computer	 code 	 s 	 	.
 Imagin 	 e 	 	a	billion	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	two	black	 hole 	 s 	 	 collide 	 d 	 	.
That	song	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 ring 	 ing 	 	through	space	for	all	that	time	.
We	 we 	 re 	 	n't	even	here	.
It	 get 	 s 	 	 close 	 r 	 	and	 close 	 r 	 	--	40,000	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	we	're	still	 do 	 ing 	 	cave	 paint 	 ing 	 s 	 	.
It	's	like	 hur 	 ry 	 	,	build	your	 instrument 	 s 	 	.
It	's	 get 	 ting 	 	 close 	 r 	 	and	 close 	 r 	 	,	and	in	20	...
 what 	 ever 	 	year	it	will	be	when	our	 detect 	 ors 	 	are	 final 	 ly 	 	at	 advance 	 d 	 	 sensitiv 	 ity 	 	--	we	'll	build	them	,	we	'll	turn	on	the	 machine 	 s 	 	and	,	bang	,	we	'll	catch	it	--	the	first	song	from	space	.
If	it	was	the	Big	Bang	we	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	pick	up	,	it	would	sound	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
It	's	a	 terr 	 ible 	 	sound	.
It	's	 liter 	 ally 	 	the	definition	of	noise	.
It	's	white	noise	;	it	's	 s 	 uch 	 	a	chaotic	 ring 	 ing 	 	.
But	it	's	around	us	 every 	 where 	 	,	 pre 	 sum 	 ably 	 	,	if	it	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 be 	 en 	 	 wipe 	 d 	 	out	by	some	other	process	in	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
And	if	we	pick	it	up	,	it	will	be	music	to	our	 ear 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	it	will	be	the	quiet	echo	of	that	moment	of	our	creation	,	of	our	 observ 	 able 	 	 uni 	 verse 	 	.
So	 with 	 in 	 	the	next	few	 year 	 s 	 	,	we	'll	be	able	to	turn	up	the	 sound 	 track 	 	a	little	bit	,	render	the	 uni 	 verse 	 	in	audio	.
But	if	we	detect	 t 	 hose 	 	 ear 	 liest 	 	 moment 	 s 	 	,	it	'll	 br 	 ing 	 	us	that	much	 close 	 r 	 	to	an	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	the	Big	Bang	,	which	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	us	that	much	 close 	 r 	 	to	 ask 	 ing 	 	some	of	the	 hard 	 est 	 	,	most	elusive	,	 question 	 s 	 	.
If	we	run	the	movie	of	our	 uni 	 verse 	 	 back 	 ward 	 s 	 	,	we	know	that	there	was	a	Big	Bang	in	our	past	,	and	we	might	even	hear	the	 caco 	 phon 	 ous 	 	sound	of	it	,	but	was	our	Big	Bang	the	 on 	 ly 	 	Big	Bang	?
I	mean	we	have	to	ask	,	 ha 	 s 	 	it	 happen 	 ed 	 	before	?
Will	it	happen	 aga 	 in 	 	?
I	mean	,	in	the	spirit	of	 ris 	 ing 	 	to	TED	's	 challeng 	 e 	 	to	 re 	 ignite 	 	wonder	,	we	can	ask	 question 	 s 	 	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	for	 th 	 is 	 	last	minute	,	that	 honest 	 ly 	 	might	 evad 	 e 	 	us	 fore 	 ver 	 	.
But	we	have	to	ask	:	 I 	 s 	 	it	possible	that	our	 uni 	 verse 	 	is	just	a	plume	off	of	some	 great 	 er 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	?
Or	,	is	it	possible	that	we	're	just	a	branch	off	of	a	 multi 	 verse 	 	--	each	branch	with	 it 	 s 	 	own	Big	Bang	in	 it 	 s 	 	past	--	 may 	 be 	 	some	of	them	with	black	 hole 	 s 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	 drum 	 s 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	some	 with 	 out 	 	--	 may 	 be 	 	some	with	 senti 	 ent 	 	life	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	some	 with 	 out 	 	--	not	in	our	past	,	not	in	our	future	,	but	 some 	 how 	 	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	us	?
So	we	have	to	wonder	,	if	there	is	a	 multi 	 verse 	 	,	in	some	other	patch	of	that	 multi 	 verse 	 	,	are	there	 creature 	 s 	 	?
 He 	 re 	 	's	my	 multi 	 verse 	 	 creature 	 s 	 	.
 A 	 re 	 	there	other	 creature 	 s 	 	in	the	 multi 	 verse 	 	,	 wonder 	 ing 	 	about	us	and	 wonder 	 ing 	 	about	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 origin 	 s 	 	?
And	if	they	are	,	I	can	imagine	them	 a 	 s 	 	we	are	,	 calcul 	 ating 	 	,	writing	computer	code	,	building	 instrument 	 s 	 	,	 try 	 ing 	 	to	detect	that	 faint 	 est 	 	sound	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 origin 	 s 	 	and	 wonder 	 ing 	 	who	else	is	out	there	.

 Tree 	 s 	 	epitomize	 s 	 ta 	 sis 	 	.
 Tree 	 s 	 	are	 root 	 ed 	 	in	the	ground	in	one	place	for	 man 	 y 	 	human	 generation 	 s 	 	,	but	if	we	shift	our	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	from	the	trunk	to	the	 t 	 wig 	 s 	 	,	 tree 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	dynamic	 ent 	 ities 	 	,	moving	and	growing	.
And	I	 decide 	 d 	 	to	explore	 th 	 is 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	by	 turn 	 ing 	 	 tree 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 artist 	 s 	 	.
I	 simpl 	 y 	 	 ti 	 ed 	 	the	end	of	a	 paint 	 brush 	 	onto	a	 t 	 wig 	 	.
I	 wait 	 ed 	 	for	the	wind	to	come	up	and	held	up	a	canvas	,	and	that	 produce 	 d 	 	art	.
The	piece	of	art	you	see	on	your	left	is	 paint 	 ed 	 	by	a	western	red	cedar	and	that	on	your	right	by	a	Douglas	fir	,	and	what	I	 learn 	 ed 	 	was	that	different	species	have	different	 signature 	 s 	 	,	like	a	Picasso	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	a	 Mon 	 et 	 	.
But	I	was	 al 	 so 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	the	 move 	 ment 	 	of	 tree 	 s 	 	and	how	 th 	 is 	 	art	might	let	me	capture	that	and	 quant 	 ify 	 	it	,	so	to	measure	the	distance	that	a	single	vine	 ma 	 ple 	 	tree	--	which	 produce 	 d 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 	--	 move 	 d 	 	in	a	single	year	,	I	 simpl 	 y 	 	 measur 	 ed 	 	and	 summ 	 ed 	 	each	of	 t 	 hose 	 	lines	.
I	 multi 	 plied 	 	them	by	the	number	of	 t 	 wig 	 s 	 	per	branch	and	the	number	of	 branch 	 es 	 	per	tree	and	then	 divid 	 ed 	 	that	by	the	number	of	 minute 	 s 	 	per	year	.
And	so	I	was	able	to	 calcul 	 ate 	 	how	far	a	single	tree	 move 	 d 	 	in	a	single	year	.
You	might	have	a	guess	.
The	answer	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	186,540	 mile 	 s 	 	,	or	seven	 time 	 s 	 	around	the	 glob 	 e 	 	.
And	so	 simpl 	 y 	 	by	shifting	our	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	from	a	single	trunk	to	the	 man 	 y 	 	dynamic	 t 	 wig 	 s 	 	,	we	are	able	to	see	that	 tree 	 s 	 	are	not	 simpl 	 y 	 	static	 ent 	 ities 	 	,	but	 ra 	 ther 	 	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	dynamic	.
And	I	 beg 	 an 	 	to	think	about	ways	that	we	might	consider	 th 	 is 	 	 less 	 on 	 	of	 tree 	 s 	 	,	to	consider	other	 ent 	 ities 	 	that	are	 al 	 so 	 	static	and	 s 	 tuck 	 	,	but	which	cry	for	change	and	 dynamic 	 ism 	 	,	and	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 ent 	 ities 	 	is	our	 pri 	 son 	 s 	 	.
 Prison 	 s 	 	,	of	course	,	are	where	people	who	break	our	 law 	 s 	 	are	 s 	 tuck 	 	,	 con 	 fin 	 ed 	 	 be 	 hind 	 	 bar 	 s 	 	.
And	our	 pri 	 son 	 	system	 it 	 self 	 	is	 s 	 tuck 	 	.
The	 Unit 	 ed 	 	 Stat 	 es 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	over	2.3	million	 incarce 	 rated 	 	men	and	women	.
That	number	is	 ris 	 ing 	 	.
Of	the	100	 incarce 	 rated 	 	people	that	are	released	,	60	will	return	to	 pri 	 son 	 	.
 Fund 	 s 	 	for	education	,	for	training	and	for	 rehabilit 	 ation 	 	are	 dec 	 lining 	 	,	so	 th 	 is 	 	 despair 	 ing 	 	cycle	of	 incarce 	 ration 	 	 continu 	 es 	 	.
I	 decide 	 d 	 	to	ask	 whet 	 her 	 	the	 less 	 on 	 	I	had	 learn 	 ed 	 	from	 tree 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 artist 	 s 	 	could	be	 appli 	 ed 	 	to	a	static	institution	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	our	 pri 	 son 	 s 	 	,	and	I	think	the	answer	is	 y 	 es 	 	.
In	the	year	2007	,	I	 start 	 ed 	 	a	 partner 	 ship 	 	with	the	 Wash 	 ington 	 	 Stat 	 e 	 	Department	of	 Correct 	 ions 	 	.
 Work 	 ing 	 	with	four	 pri 	 son 	 s 	 	,	we	 beg 	 an 	 	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	science	and	 scientist 	 s 	 	,	 sustain 	 ability 	 	and	 conserv 	 ation 	 	 project 	 s 	 	to	four	state	 pri 	 son 	 s 	 	.
We	give	science	 lectur 	 es 	 	,	and	the	men	here	are	 choos 	 ing 	 	to	come	to	our	science	 lectur 	 es 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 watch 	 ing 	 	 tele 	 vision 	 	or	 weight 	 lift 	 ing 	 	.
That	,	I	think	,	is	 move 	 ment 	 	.
We	 partner 	 ed 	 	with	the	Nature	 Conserv 	 ancy 	 	for	 in 	 mate 	 s 	 	at	 St 	 afford 	 	 Cre 	 ek 	 	 Correct 	 ional 	 	 Cent 	 er 	 	to	grow	 en 	 danger 	 ed 	 	prairie	 plant 	 s 	 	for	 resto 	 ration 	 	of	 re 	 lic 	 	prairie	 area 	 s 	 	in	 Wash 	 ington 	 	state	.
That	,	I	think	,	is	 move 	 ment 	 	.
We	 work 	 ed 	 	with	the	 Wash 	 ington 	 	 Stat 	 e 	 	Department	of	Fish	and	 Wild 	 life 	 	to	grow	 en 	 danger 	 ed 	 	 frog 	 s 	 	--	the	Oregon	 spot 	 ted 	 	frog	--	for	 lat 	 er 	 	 re 	 lease 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 protect 	 ed 	 	 wet 	 land 	 s 	 	.
That	,	I	think	,	is	 move 	 ment 	 	.
And	just	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	we	've	 beg 	 un 	 	to	work	with	 t 	 hose 	 	men	who	are	 s 	 egreg 	 ated 	 	in	what	we	call	 Super 	 max 	 	 facil 	 ities 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	've	 incur 	 red 	 	violent	 in 	 fraction 	 s 	 	by	 be 	 coming 	 	violent	with	 guard 	 s 	 	and	with	other	 prisoner 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	 ke 	 pt 	 	in	bare	 cell 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	for	23	 hour 	 s 	 	a	day	.
When	they	have	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	review	 board 	 s 	 	or	mental	health	 professional 	 s 	 	,	they	're	 place 	 d 	 	in	 im 	 mobile 	 	 booth 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
For	one	hour	a	day	they	're	 br 	 ought 	 	to	these	 b 	 leak 	 	and	 b 	 land 	 	 exercis 	 e 	 	 yard 	 s 	 	.
 Al 	 th 	 ough 	 	we	ca	n't	 br 	 ing 	 	 tree 	 s 	 	and	prairie	 plant 	 s 	 	and	 frog 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	these	 environment 	 s 	 	,	we	are	 br 	 ing 	 ing 	 	 image 	 s 	 	of	nature	 in 	 to 	 	these	 exercis 	 e 	 	 yard 	 s 	 	,	 put 	 ting 	 	them	on	the	 wall 	 s 	 	,	so	at	 l 	 east 	 	they	get	contact	with	visual	 image 	 s 	 	of	nature	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 Mr 	 . 	 	 Lo 	 pe 	 z 	 	,	who	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	in	 so 	 lit 	 ary 	 	 con 	 fine 	 ment 	 	for	18	 month 	 s 	 	,	and	he	's	 pro 	 vid 	 ing 	 	 in 	 put 	 	on	the	 type 	 s 	 	of	 image 	 s 	 	that	he	 believ 	 es 	 	would	make	him	and	his	fellow	 in 	 mate 	 s 	 	more	 s 	 er 	 ene 	 	,	more	calm	,	less	apt	to	violence	.
And	so	what	we	see	,	I	think	,	is	that	small	,	 collect 	 ive 	 	 move 	 ments 	 	of	change	can	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	move	an	 ent 	 ity 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	our	own	 pri 	 son 	 	system	in	a	direction	of	hope	.
We	know	that	 tree 	 s 	 	are	static	 ent 	 ities 	 	when	we	look	at	 the 	 ir 	 	 trunk 	 s 	 	.
But	if	 tree 	 s 	 	can	create	art	,	if	they	can	 en 	 circle 	 	the	 glob 	 e 	 	seven	 time 	 s 	 	in	one	year	,	if	 prisoner 	 s 	 	can	grow	 plant 	 s 	 	and	raise	 frog 	 s 	 	,	then	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	there	are	other	static	 ent 	 ities 	 	that	we	hold	 in 	 side 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	like	grief	,	like	 addict 	 ions 	 	,	like	 rac 	 ism 	 	,	that	can	 al 	 so 	 	change	.
Thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.

 A 	 s 	 	the	child	 grow 	 s 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	an	adult	:	so	far	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	a	consumer	,	but	the	growth	of	a	human	 be 	 ing 	 	lies	in	his	or	her	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	 con 	 tribute 	 	,	to	be	a	contributor	.
One	can	not	 con 	 tribute 	 	 un 	 less 	 	one	 feel 	 s 	 	secure	,	one	 feel 	 s 	 	big	,	one	 feel 	 s 	 	:	I	have	 en 	 ough 	 	.
To	be	 com 	 passionate 	 	is	not	a	joke	.
It	's	not	that	simple	.
One	 ha 	 s 	 	to	discover	a	certain	 big 	 ness 	 	in	 one 	 self 	 	.
That	 big 	 ness 	 	should	be	 center 	 ed 	 	on	 one 	 self 	 	,	not	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	money	,	not	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	power	you	wield	,	not	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	any	 stat 	 us 	 	that	you	can	command	in	the	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	but	it	should	be	 center 	 ed 	 	on	 one 	 self 	 	.
The	self	:	you	are	 self 	 - 	 aware 	 	.
On	that	self	,	it	should	be	 center 	 ed 	 	--	a	 big 	 ness 	 	,	a	 whole 	 ness 	 	.
 Other 	 wise 	 	,	 compass 	 ion 	 	is	just	a	word	and	a	dream	.
You	can	be	 com 	 passionate 	 	 occasion 	 ally 	 	,	more	 move 	 d 	 	by	 empath 	 y 	 	than	by	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
Thank	God	we	are	 em 	 pathetic 	 	.
When	 some 	 body 	 	's	in	pain	,	we	pick	up	the	pain	.
In	a	 W 	 im 	 bled 	 on 	 	final	match	,	these	two	 guy 	 s 	 	fight	it	out	.
 E 	 ach 	 	one	 ha 	 s 	 	got	two	 game 	 s 	 	.
It	can	be	 any 	 body 	 	's	game	.
What	they	have	 sweat 	 ed 	 	so	far	 ha 	 s 	 	no	meaning	.
One	person	 win 	 s 	 	.
The	tennis	 et 	 ique 	 tte 	 	is	,	both	the	 player 	 s 	 	have	to	come	to	the	net	and	shake	 hand 	 s 	 	.
The	winner	boxes	the	air	and	 kiss 	 es 	 	the	ground	,	 throw 	 s 	 	his	shirt	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	 some 	 body 	 	is	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	it	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	guy	 ha 	 s 	 	to	come	to	the	net	.
When	he	 come 	 s 	 	to	the	net	,	you	see	,	his	whole	face	 change 	 s 	 	.
It	 look 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	he	's	 wish 	 ing 	 	that	he	did	n't	win	.
Why	?	 Em 	 pathy 	 	.
That	's	human	heart	.
No	human	heart	is	 deni 	 ed 	 	of	that	 empath 	 y 	 	.
No	 relig 	 ion 	 	can	demolish	that	by	 in 	 doctri 	 nation 	 	.
No	culture	,	no	nation	and	 national 	 ism 	 	--	 noth 	 ing 	 	can	touch	it	 be 	 cause 	 	it	is	 empath 	 y 	 	.
And	that	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	 empath 	 ize 	 	is	the	window	through	which	you	reach	out	to	people	,	you	do	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 make 	 s 	 	a	 differ 	 ence 	 	in	 some 	 body 	 	's	life	--	even	 word 	 s 	 	,	even	time	.
 Com 	 pass 	 ion 	 	is	not	defined	in	one	form	.
There	's	no	Indian	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
There	's	no	American	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
It	 transcend 	 s 	 	nation	,	the	gender	,	the	age	.
Why	?	 Be 	 cause 	 	it	is	there	in	 every 	 body 	 	.
It	's	 experience 	 d 	 	by	people	 occasion 	 ally 	 	.
 Th 	 en 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 occasion 	 al 	 	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	we	are	not	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	--	it	will	never	remain	 occasion 	 al 	 	.
By	 man 	 date 	 	,	you	can	not	make	a	person	 com 	 passionate 	 	.
You	ca	n't	say	,	``	 P 	 lease 	 	love	me	.	''
Love	is	 some 	 thing 	 	you	discover	.
It	's	not	an	action	,	but	in	the	English	language	,	it	is	 al 	 so 	 	an	action	.
I	will	come	to	it	 lat 	 er 	 	.
So	one	 ha 	 s 	 	got	to	discover	a	certain	 whole 	 ness 	 	.
I	am	going	to	cite	the	 possibil 	 ity 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	whole	,	which	is	 with 	 in 	 	our	experience	,	 every 	 body 	 	's	experience	.
In	spite	of	a	 ver 	 y 	 	tragic	life	,	one	is	happy	in	 moment 	 s 	 	which	are	 ver 	 y 	 	few	and	far	between	.
And	the	one	who	is	happy	,	even	for	a	 s 	 lap 	 stick 	 	joke	,	 accept 	 s 	 	 him 	 self 	 	and	 al 	 so 	 	the	scheme	of	 thing 	 s 	 	in	which	one	 find 	 s 	 	 one 	 self 	 	.
That	 mean 	 s 	 	the	whole	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	known	 thing 	 s 	 	and	 un 	 known 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
All	of	them	are	 total 	 ly 	 	 accept 	 ed 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	you	discover	your	 whole 	 ness 	 	in	 your 	 self 	 	.
The	subject	--	``	me	''	--	and	the	object	--	the	scheme	of	 thing 	 s 	 	--	fuse	 in 	 to 	 	 one 	 ness 	 	,	an	experience	 no 	 body 	 	can	say	,	``	I	am	 deni 	 ed 	 	of	,	''	an	experience	common	to	all	and	 s 	 un 	 dry 	 	.
That	experience	 confirm 	 s 	 	that	,	in	spite	of	all	your	 limit 	 ations 	 	--	all	your	 want 	 s 	 	,	 desir 	 es 	 	,	 un 	 fulfill 	 ed 	 	,	and	the	credit	 card 	 s 	 	and	 lay 	 off 	 s 	 	and	,	 final 	 ly 	 	,	 bald 	 ness 	 	--	you	can	be	happy	.
But	the	 extens 	 ion 	 	of	the	logic	is	that	you	do	n't	need	to	fulfill	your	 desir 	 e 	 	to	be	happy	.
You	are	the	 ver 	 y 	 	happiness	,	the	 whole 	 ness 	 	that	you	want	to	be	.
There	's	no	choice	in	 th 	 is 	 	:	that	 on 	 ly 	 	 confirm 	 s 	 	the	 re 	 ality 	 	that	the	 whole 	 ness 	 	can	not	be	different	from	you	,	can	not	be	minus	you	.
It	 ha 	 s 	 	got	to	be	you	.
You	can	not	be	a	part	of	 whole 	 ness 	 	and	still	be	whole	.
Your	moment	of	happiness	 reveal 	 s 	 	that	 re 	 ality 	 	,	that	 real 	 ization 	 	,	that	 re 	 cognition 	 	:	``	 May 	 be 	 	I	am	the	whole	.
 May 	 be 	 	the	swami	is	right	.
 May 	 be 	 	the	swami	is	right	.	''	You	start	your	new	life	.
 Th 	 en 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 meaning 	 ful 	 	.
I	have	no	more	reason	to	blame	 my 	 self 	 	.
If	one	 ha 	 s 	 	to	blame	 one 	 self 	 	,	one	 ha 	 s 	 	a	million	 reason 	 s 	 	plus	 man 	 y 	 	.
But	if	I	say	,	in	spite	of	my	body	 be 	 ing 	 	 limit 	 ed 	 	--	if	it	is	black	it	is	not	white	,	if	it	is	white	it	is	not	black	:	body	is	 limit 	 ed 	 	any	which	way	you	look	at	it	.	 L 	 imit 	 ed 	 	.
Your	knowledge	is	 limit 	 ed 	 	,	health	is	 limit 	 ed 	 	,	and	power	is	 there 	 fore 	 	 limit 	 ed 	 	,	and	the	 cheer 	 fulness 	 	is	going	to	be	 limit 	 ed 	 	.
 Com 	 pass 	 ion 	 	is	going	to	be	 limit 	 ed 	 	.
 Every 	 thing 	 	is	going	to	be	 limit 	 less 	 	.
You	can	not	command	 compass 	 ion 	 	 un 	 less 	 	you	 be 	 come 	 	 limit 	 less 	 	,	and	 no 	 body 	 	can	 be 	 come 	 	 limit 	 less 	 	,	either	you	are	or	you	are	not	.	Period	.
And	there	is	no	way	of	your	 be 	 ing 	 	not	 limit 	 less 	 	too	.
Your	own	experience	 reveal 	 s 	 	,	in	spite	of	all	 limit 	 ations 	 	,	you	are	the	whole	.
And	the	 whole 	 ness 	 	is	the	 re 	 ality 	 	of	you	when	you	 re 	 late 	 	to	the	world	.
It	is	love	first	.
When	you	 re 	 late 	 	to	the	world	,	the	dynamic	 manifest 	 ation 	 	of	the	 whole 	 ness 	 	is	,	what	we	say	,	love	.
And	 it 	 self 	 	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 compass 	 ion 	 	if	the	object	that	you	 re 	 late 	 	to	 evoke 	 s 	 	that	emotion	.
 Th 	 en 	 	that	 aga 	 in 	 	 transform 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	giving	,	 in 	 to 	 	sharing	.
You	express	 your 	 self 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	you	have	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
To	discover	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	you	need	to	be	 com 	 passionate 	 	.
To	discover	the	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	give	and	share	,	you	need	to	be	giving	and	sharing	.
There	is	no	 short 	 cut 	 	:	it	is	like	 swimm 	 ing 	 	by	 swimm 	 ing 	 	.
You	learn	 swimm 	 ing 	 	by	 swimm 	 ing 	 	.
You	can	not	learn	 swimm 	 ing 	 	on	a	foam	mattress	and	enter	 in 	 to 	 	water	.
You	learn	 swimm 	 ing 	 	by	 swimm 	 ing 	 	.	You	learn	 cycl 	 ing 	 	by	 cycl 	 ing 	 	.
You	learn	 cook 	 ing 	 	by	 cook 	 ing 	 	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	some	 sym 	 pathetic 	 	people	around	you	to	eat	what	you	cook	.
And	,	 there 	 fore 	 	,	what	I	say	,	you	have	to	fake	it	and	make	it	.
You	need	to	.
My	 pre 	 decessor 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	that	.
You	have	to	act	it	out	.
You	have	to	act	 com 	 passionate 	 ly 	 	.
There	is	no	verb	for	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	but	you	have	an	 ad 	 verb 	 	for	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
That	's	 interest 	 ing 	 	to	me	.
You	act	 com 	 passionate 	 ly 	 	.
But	then	,	how	to	act	 com 	 passionate 	 ly 	 	if	you	do	n't	have	 compass 	 ion 	 	?
That	is	where	you	fake	.
You	fake	it	and	make	it	.	 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	 man 	 tra 	 	of	the	 Unit 	 ed 	 	 Stat 	 es 	 	of	America	.
You	fake	it	and	make	it	.
You	act	 com 	 passionate 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 th 	 ough 	 	you	have	 compass 	 ion 	 	:	grind	your	 tee 	 th 	 	,	take	all	the	support	system	.
If	you	know	how	to	pray	,	pray	.
Ask	for	 compass 	 ion 	 	.
Let	me	act	 com 	 passionate 	 ly 	 	.
Do	it	.
You	'll	discover	 compass 	 ion 	 	and	 al 	 so 	 	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	a	 relat 	 ive 	 	 compass 	 ion 	 	,	and	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	if	you	get	the	right	 teach 	 ing 	 	,	you	'll	discover	 compass 	 ion 	 	is	a	dynamic	 manifest 	 ation 	 	of	the	 re 	 ality 	 	of	 your 	 self 	 	,	which	is	 one 	 ness 	 	,	 whole 	 ness 	 	,	and	that	's	what	you	are	.
With	these	 word 	 s 	 	,	thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.

 Shi 	 rin 	 	 Ne 	 s 	 hat 	 	:	Art	in	 ex 	 ile 	 
The	story	I	 want 	 ed 	 	to	share	with	you	 to 	 day 	 	is	my	 challeng 	 e 	 	 a 	 s 	 	an	Iranian	artist	,	 a 	 s 	 	an	Iranian	woman	artist	,	 a 	 s 	 	an	Iranian	woman	artist	living	in	 ex 	 ile 	 	.
Well	,	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 plus 	 es 	 	and	 minus 	 es 	 	.
On	the	dark	side	,	 politic 	 s 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	seem	to	 es 	 cape 	 	people	like	me	.
Every	Iranian	artist	,	in	one	form	or	 an 	 other 	 	,	is	 politic 	 al 	 	.
 Poli 	 tics 	 	have	defined	our	 live 	 s 	 	.
If	you	're	living	in	Iran	,	you	're	facing	 censor 	 ship 	 	,	 harass 	 ment 	 	,	arrest	,	torture	--	at	 time 	 s 	 	,	 exec 	 ution 	 	.
If	you	're	living	 out 	 side 	 	like	me	,	you	're	 face 	 d 	 	with	life	in	 ex 	 ile 	 	--	the	pain	of	the	 long 	 ing 	 	and	the	 separat 	 ion 	 	from	your	 love 	 d 	 	 one 	 s 	 	and	your	family	.
 There 	 fore 	 	,	we	do	n't	find	the	moral	,	 emotion 	 al 	 	,	 psycho 	 logical 	 	and	 politic 	 al 	 	space	to	distance	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	from	the	 re 	 ality 	 	of	social	 respons 	 ibility 	 	.
 Odd 	 ly 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	an	artist	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 my 	 self 	 	 find 	 s 	 	 her 	 self 	 	 al 	 so 	 	in	the	position	of	 be 	 ing 	 	the	voice	,	the	speaker	of	my	people	,	even	if	I	have	,	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	no	access	to	my	own	country	.
 Al 	 so 	 	,	people	like	 my 	 self 	 	,	we	're	 fight 	 ing 	 	two	 battle 	 s 	 	on	different	 ground 	 s 	 	.
We	're	 be 	 ing 	 	critical	of	the	West	,	the	 per 	 ception 	 	of	the	West	about	our	 ident 	 ity 	 	--	about	the	image	that	is	 construct 	 ed 	 	about	us	,	about	our	women	,	about	our	 politic 	 s 	 	,	about	our	 relig 	 ion 	 	.
We	are	there	to	take	 pri 	 de 	 	and	insist	on	respect	.
And	at	the	same	time	,	we	're	 fight 	 ing 	 	 an 	 other 	 	battle	.
That	is	our	regime	,	our	government	--	our	 atro 	 c 	 ious 	 	government	,	[	that	]	 ha 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	every	crime	in	order	to	stay	in	power	.
Our	 artist 	 s 	 	are	at	risk	.
We	are	in	a	position	of	danger	.
We	pose	a	threat	to	the	order	of	the	government	.
But	 iron 	 ically 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 empower 	 ed 	 	all	of	us	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	are	 consider 	 ed 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	 artist 	 s 	 	,	central	to	the	cultural	,	 politic 	 al 	 	,	social	 dis 	 course 	 	in	Iran	.
We	are	there	to	inspire	,	to	 provok 	 e 	 	,	to	mobilize	,	to	 br 	 ing 	 	hope	to	our	people	.
We	are	the	 report 	 ers 	 	of	our	people	,	and	are	 communicator 	 s 	 	to	the	 out 	 side 	 	world	.
Art	is	our	weapon	.
 Cultur 	 e 	 	is	a	form	of	 resist 	 ance 	 	.
I	 en 	 vy 	 	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	the	 artist 	 s 	 	of	the	West	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 free 	 dom 	 	of	 express 	 ion 	 	.
For	the	fact	that	they	can	distance	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	from	the	question	of	 politic 	 s 	 	.
From	the	fact	that	they	are	 on 	 ly 	 	 serv 	 ing 	 	one	audience	,	 main 	 ly 	 	the	Western	culture	.
But	 al 	 so 	 	,	I	worry	about	the	West	,	 be 	 cause 	 	often	in	 th 	 is 	 	country	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	Western	world	that	we	have	,	culture	 risk 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	a	form	of	 entertain 	 ment 	 	.
Our	people	depend	on	our	 artist 	 s 	 	,	and	culture	is	beyond	communication	.
My	journey	 a 	 s 	 	an	artist	 start 	 ed 	 	from	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	personal	place	.
I	did	not	start	to	make	social	 comment 	 ary 	 	about	my	country	.
The	first	one	that	you	see	in	front	of	you	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	when	I	first	 return 	 ed 	 	to	Iran	after	 be 	 ing 	 	 separat 	 ed 	 	for	a	good	12	 year 	 s 	 	.
It	was	after	the	Islamic	 R 	 evolution 	 	of	1979	.
 Whi 	 le 	 	I	was	absent	from	Iran	,	the	Islamic	 R 	 evolution 	 	had	 descend 	 ed 	 	on	Iran	and	had	 entire 	 ly 	 	 transform 	 ed 	 	the	country	from	 Per 	 s 	 ian 	 	to	the	Islamic	culture	.
I	came	 main 	 ly 	 	to	be	 re 	 unit 	 ed 	 	with	my	family	and	to	 re 	 connect 	 	in	a	way	that	I	found	my	place	in	the	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
But	 in 	 stead 	 	,	I	found	a	country	that	was	 total 	 ly 	 	 ideo 	 logical 	 	and	that	I	did	n't	 recogn 	 ize 	 	 any 	 more 	 	.
 Mo 	 re 	 	so	,	I	 be 	 came 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	I	was	facing	my	own	personal	 dilemma 	 s 	 	and	 question 	 s 	 	,	I	 be 	 came 	 	 immers 	 ed 	 	in	the	 stud 	 y 	 	of	the	Islamic	 R 	 evolution 	 	--	how	,	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	it	had	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 transform 	 ed 	 	the	 live 	 s 	 	of	Iranian	women	.
I	found	the	subject	of	Iranian	women	in	the	way	the	women	of	Iran	,	 historic 	 ally 	 	,	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	 em 	 body 	 	the	 politic 	 al 	 	 transform 	 ation 	 	.
So	in	a	way	,	by	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	a	woman	,	you	can	read	the	structure	and	the	 ideo 	 logy 	 	of	the	country	.
So	I	made	a	group	of	work	that	at	once	 face 	 d 	 	my	own	personal	 question 	 s 	 	in	life	,	and	yet	it	 br 	 ought 	 	my	work	 in 	 to 	 	a	 large 	 r 	 	 dis 	 course 	 	--	the	subject	of	 martyr 	 dom 	 	,	the	question	of	 t 	 hose 	 	who	 will 	 ing 	 ly 	 	stand	in	that	 intersect 	 ion 	 	of	love	of	God	,	faith	,	but	violence	and	crime	and	 cruel 	 ty 	 	.
For	me	,	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 came 	 	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
And	yet	,	I	had	an	 un 	 usual 	 	position	 to 	 ward 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
I	was	an	 out 	 sider 	 	who	had	come	back	to	Iran	to	find	my	place	,	but	I	was	not	in	a	position	to	be	critical	of	the	government	or	the	 ideo 	 logy 	 	of	the	Islamic	 R 	 evolution 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 change 	 d 	 	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	 a 	 s 	 	I	found	my	voice	and	I	 discover 	 ed 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	that	I	did	n't	know	I	would	discover	.
So	my	art	 be 	 came 	 	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	more	critical	.
My	knife	 be 	 came 	 	a	little	 sharp 	 er 	 	.
And	I	fell	 in 	 to 	 	a	life	in	 ex 	 ile 	 	.
I	am	a	 nomad 	 ic 	 	artist	.
I	work	in	 Moro 	 cco 	 	,	in	 Turk 	 ey 	 	,	in	Mexico	.
I	go	 every 	 where 	 	to	make	 believ 	 e 	 	it	's	Iran	.
 N 	 ow 	 	I	am	making	 film 	 s 	 	.
Last	year	,	I	 finish 	 ed 	 	a	film	 call 	 ed 	 	``	Women	 With 	 out 	 	Men	.	''
``	Women	 With 	 out 	 	Men	''	 return 	 s 	 	to	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	but	 an 	 other 	 	part	of	our	Iranian	 histo 	 ry 	 	.
It	 go 	 es 	 	to	1953	when	American	 CI 	 A 	 	 exercis 	 ed 	 	a	coup	and	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	a	 democrat 	 ically 	 	 elect 	 ed 	 	 lead 	 er 	 	,	The	book	is	written	by	an	Iranian	woman	,	 Shah 	 rnush 	 	 Par 	 s 	 i 	 pur 	 	.
It	's	a	 magic 	 al 	 	 re 	 alist 	 	novel	.
 Th 	 is 	 	book	is	 bann 	 ed 	 	,	and	she	 s 	 pent 	 	five	 year 	 s 	 	in	 pri 	 son 	 	.
My	obsession	with	 th 	 is 	 	book	,	and	the	reason	I	made	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	film	,	is	 be 	 cause 	 	it	at	once	was	 address 	 ing 	 	the	question	of	 be 	 ing 	 	a	female	--	 tradition 	 ally 	 	,	 historic 	 ally 	 	in	Iran	--	and	the	question	of	four	women	who	are	all	looking	for	an	idea	of	change	,	 free 	 dom 	 	and	 demo 	 cracy 	 	--	while	the	country	of	Iran	,	 equal 	 ly 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	if	 an 	 other 	 	character	,	 al 	 so 	 	 struggle 	 d 	 	for	an	idea	of	 free 	 dom 	 	and	 demo 	 cracy 	 	and	 in 	 depend 	 ence 	 	from	the	foreign	 intervention 	 s 	 	.
I	made	 th 	 is 	 	film	 be 	 cause 	 	I	felt	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	for	it	to	speak	to	the	 Western 	 ers 	 	about	our	 histo 	 ry 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	country	.
That	all	of	you	seem	to	remember	Iran	after	the	Islamic	 R 	 evolution 	 	.
That	Iran	was	once	a	secular	 socie 	 ty 	 	,	and	we	had	 demo 	 cracy 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 demo 	 cracy 	 	was	 stole 	 n 	 	from	us	by	the	American	government	,	by	the	 Brit 	 ish 	 	government	.
 Th 	 is 	 	film	 al 	 so 	 	 speak 	 s 	 	to	the	Iranian	people	in	 ask 	 ing 	 	them	to	return	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	and	look	at	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	before	they	 we 	 re 	 	so	 Islamic 	 ized 	 	--	in	the	way	we	 look 	 ed 	 	,	in	the	way	we	 play 	 ed 	 	music	,	in	the	way	we	had	intellectual	life	.
And	most	of	all	,	in	the	way	that	we	 f 	 ought 	 	for	 demo 	 cracy 	 	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	some	of	the	 shot 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	from	my	film	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	some	of	the	 image 	 s 	 	of	the	coup	.
And	we	made	 th 	 is 	 	film	in	 Casa 	 blanca 	 	,	 re 	 creating 	 	all	the	 shot 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	film	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	find	a	balance	between	 tell 	 ing 	 	a	 politic 	 al 	 	story	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	a	 femin 	 ine 	 	story	.
 Be 	 ing 	 	a	visual	artist	,	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	,	I	am	 fore 	 most 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	to	make	art	--	to	make	art	that	 transcend 	 s 	 	 politic 	 s 	 	,	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	the	question	of	 femin 	 ism 	 	,	and	 be 	 come 	 	an	 import 	 ant 	 	,	 time 	 less 	 	,	universal	work	of	art	.
The	 challeng 	 e 	 	I	have	is	how	to	do	that	.
How	to	tell	a	 politic 	 al 	 	story	but	an	 alle 	 gor 	 ical 	 	story	.
How	to	move	you	with	your	 emotion 	 s 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	make	your	mind	work	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	are	some	of	the	 image 	 s 	 	and	the	 character 	 s 	 	of	the	film	.
 N 	 ow 	 	 come 	 s 	 	the	green	 move 	 ment 	 	--	the	summer	of	2009	,	 a 	 s 	 	my	film	is	released	--	the	 up 	 ris 	 ing 	 	 begin 	 s 	 	in	the	 street 	 s 	 	of	Tehran	.
What	is	 un 	 believ 	 ably 	 	 iron 	 ic 	 	is	the	period	that	we	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	depict	in	the	film	,	the	cry	for	 demo 	 cracy 	 	and	social	justice	,	 repeat 	 s 	 	 it 	 self 	 	now	 aga 	 in 	 	in	Tehran	.
The	green	 move 	 ment 	 	 significant 	 ly 	 	inspired	the	world	.
It	 br 	 ought 	 	a	lot	of	attention	to	all	 t 	 hose 	 	 Iranian 	 s 	 	who	stand	for	 bas 	 ic 	 	human	 right 	 s 	 	and	struggle	for	 demo 	 cracy 	 	.
What	was	most	significant	for	me	was	,	once	 aga 	 in 	 	,	the	presence	of	the	women	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 inspiration 	 al 	 	for	me	.
If	in	the	Islamic	 R 	 evolution 	 	,	the	 image 	 s 	 	of	the	woman	 port 	 ray 	 ed 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 sub 	 mis 	 s 	 ive 	 	and	did	n't	have	a	voice	,	now	we	saw	a	new	idea	of	 femin 	 ism 	 	in	the	 street 	 s 	 	of	Tehran	--	women	who	 we 	 re 	 	educated	,	forward	 think 	 ing 	 	,	 non 	 - 	 tradition 	 al 	 	,	 sexual 	 ly 	 	open	,	 fear 	 less 	 	and	 serious 	 ly 	 	feminist	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	women	and	 t 	 hose 	 	young	men	 unit 	 ed 	 	 Iranian 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	world	,	 in 	 side 	 	and	 out 	 side 	 	.
I	then	 discover 	 ed 	 	why	I	take	so	much	inspiration	from	Iranian	women	.
That	,	under	all	 circum 	 stance 	 s 	 	,	they	have	 push 	 ed 	 	the	 bound 	 ary 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	have	 confront 	 ed 	 	the	 author 	 ity 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	have	broken	every	rule	in	the	 small 	 est 	 	and	the	 big 	 gest 	 	way	.
And	once	 aga 	 in 	 	,	they	 prov 	 ed 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
I	stand	here	to	say	that	Iranian	women	have	found	a	new	voice	,	and	 the 	 ir 	 	voice	is	giving	me	my	voice	.
And	it	's	a	great	honor	to	be	an	Iranian	woman	and	an	Iranian	artist	,	even	if	I	have	to	 oper 	 ate 	 	in	the	West	 on 	 ly 	 	for	now	.
Thank	you	so	much	.

 O 	 liver 	 	Sacks	:	What	 hallucin 	 ation 	 	 reveal 	 s 	 	about	our	 mind 	 s 	 
We	see	with	the	 eye 	 s 	 	,	but	we	see	with	the	brain	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
And	 see 	 ing 	 	with	the	brain	is	often	 call 	 ed 	 	 imagin 	 ation 	 	.
And	we	are	familiar	with	the	 land 	 scapes 	 	of	our	own	 imagin 	 ation 	 	,	our	 in 	 scapes 	 	.	We	've	lived	with	them	all	our	 live 	 s 	 	.
But	there	are	 al 	 so 	 	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	and	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	are	 complete 	 ly 	 	different	.
 The 	 y 	 	do	n't	seem	to	be	of	our	creation	.
 The 	 y 	 	do	n't	seem	to	be	under	our	control	.
 The 	 y 	 	seem	to	come	from	the	 out 	 side 	 	,	and	to	mimic	 per 	 ception 	 	.
So	I	am	going	to	be	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	,	and	a	 part 	 icular 	 	sort	of	visual	 hallucin 	 ation 	 	which	I	see	among	my	 patient 	 s 	 	.
A	few	 month 	 s 	 	ago	,	I	got	a	phone	call	from	a	 nurs 	 ing 	 	home	where	I	work	.
 The 	 y 	 	told	me	that	one	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 resident 	 s 	 	,	an	old	 lad 	 y 	 	in	her	90s	,	was	 see 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 wonder 	 ed 	 	if	she	'd	gone	 bon 	 ker 	 s 	 	or	,	 be 	 cause 	 	she	was	an	old	 lad 	 y 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	she	'd	had	a	stroke	,	or	 whet 	 her 	 	she	had	Alzheimer	's	.
And	so	they	 ask 	 ed 	 	me	if	I	would	come	and	see	 Rosa 	 lie 	 	,	the	old	 lad 	 y 	 	.
I	went	in	to	see	her	.
It	was	evident	straight	away	that	she	was	 perfect 	 ly 	 	 s 	 ane 	 	and	lucid	and	of	good	 intellig 	 ence 	 	,	but	she	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 start 	 led 	 	and	 ver 	 y 	 	 be 	 wild 	 er 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	she	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
And	she	told	me	--	the	 nurse 	 s 	 	had	n't	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	--	that	she	was	blind	,	that	she	had	 be 	 en 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	blind	from	 ma 	 cular 	 	 de 	 generation 	 	for	five	 year 	 s 	 	.
But	now	,	for	the	last	few	 day 	 s 	 	,	she	'd	 be 	 en 	 	 see 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
So	I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	What	sort	of	 thing 	 s 	 	?	''
And	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	People	in	 East 	 ern 	 	dress	,	in	 d 	 rape 	 s 	 	,	 walk 	 ing 	 	up	and	down	 stair 	 s 	 	.
A	man	who	 turn 	 s 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	me	and	 s 	 mile 	 s 	 	.
But	he	 ha 	 s 	 	huge	 tee 	 th 	 	on	one	side	of	his	mouth	.
 Anim 	 al 	 s 	 	too	.
I	see	a	white	building	.	It	's	 snow 	 ing 	 	,	a	soft	snow	.
I	see	 th 	 is 	 	horse	with	a	harness	,	 drag 	 ging 	 	the	snow	away	.
 Th 	 en 	 	,	one	night	,	the	scene	 change 	 s 	 	.
I	see	 cat 	 s 	 	and	 dog 	 s 	 	 walk 	 ing 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	me	.
 The 	 y 	 	come	to	a	certain	point	and	then	stop	.
 Th 	 en 	 	it	 change 	 s 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.
I	see	a	lot	of	children	.	 The 	 y 	 	are	 walk 	 ing 	 	up	and	down	 stair 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	wear	bright	 color 	 s 	 	,	rose	and	blue	,	like	 East 	 ern 	 	dress	.	''
 Some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	before	the	people	come	on	,	she	may	 hallucin 	 ate 	 	pink	and	blue	 square 	 s 	 	on	the	floor	,	which	seem	to	go	up	to	the	 ceil 	 ing 	 	.
I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 I 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	like	a	dream	?	''
And	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	No	,	it	's	not	like	a	dream	.	It	's	like	a	movie	.	''
She	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	It	's	got	color	.	It	's	got	motion	.
But	it	's	 complete 	 ly 	 	silent	,	like	a	silent	movie	.	''
And	she	 s 	 aid 	 	that	it	's	a	 ra 	 ther 	 	 bor 	 ing 	 	movie	.
She	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	All	these	people	with	 East 	 ern 	 	dress	,	 walk 	 ing 	 	up	and	down	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 repetit 	 ive 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 limit 	 ed 	 	.	''
And	she	 ha 	 s 	 	a	sense	of	humor	.
She	 k 	 new 	 	it	was	a	 hallucin 	 ation 	 	.
But	she	was	 frighten 	 ed 	 	.	She	'd	lived	95	 year 	 s 	 	and	she	'd	never	had	a	 hallucin 	 ation 	 	before	.
She	 s 	 aid 	 	that	the	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 un 	 related 	 	to	 any 	 thing 	 	she	was	 think 	 ing 	 	or	 feel 	 ing 	 	or	 do 	 ing 	 	,	that	they	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	come	on	by	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	or	disappear	.
She	had	no	control	over	them	.
She	 s 	 aid 	 	she	did	n't	 recogn 	 ize 	 	any	of	the	people	or	 place 	 s 	 	in	the	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	.
And	 non 	 e 	 	of	the	people	or	the	 animal 	 s 	 	,	well	,	they	all	 seem 	 ed 	 	 obliv 	 ious 	 	of	her	.
And	she	did	n't	know	what	was	going	on	.
She	 wonder 	 ed 	 	if	she	was	going	mad	or	 lo 	 s 	 ing 	 	her	mind	.
Well	,	I	 examine 	 d 	 	her	 care 	 fully 	 	.
She	was	a	bright	old	 lad 	 y 	 	,	 perfect 	 ly 	 	 s 	 ane 	 	.	She	had	no	medical	 problem 	 s 	 	.
She	was	n't	on	any	 medic 	 ations 	 	which	could	produce	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	.
But	she	was	blind	.
And	I	then	 s 	 aid 	 	to	her	,	``	I	think	I	know	what	you	have	.	''
I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	There	is	a	special	form	of	visual	 hallucin 	 ation 	 	which	may	go	with	 deterio 	 rating 	 	vision	or	 blind 	 ness 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	was	 original 	 ly 	 	 de 	 scribed 	 	,	''	I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	right	back	in	the	18th	century	,	by	a	man	 call 	 ed 	 	 Char 	 les 	 	 B 	 on 	 net 	 	.
And	you	have	 Char 	 les 	 	 B 	 on 	 net 	 	syndrome	.
There	is	 noth 	 ing 	 	wrong	with	your	brain	.	There	is	 noth 	 ing 	 	wrong	with	your	mind	.
You	have	 Char 	 les 	 	 B 	 on 	 net 	 	syndrome	.	''
And	she	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 reliev 	 ed 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	,	that	there	was	 noth 	 ing 	 	 serious 	 ly 	 	the	matter	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	 cur 	 ious 	 	.
She	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Who	is	 th 	 is 	 	 Char 	 les 	 	 B 	 on 	 net 	 	?	''
She	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Did	he	have	them	 him 	 self 	 	?	''
And	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Tell	all	the	 nurse 	 s 	 	that	I	have	 Char 	 les 	 	 B 	 on 	 net 	 	syndrome	.	''
``	I	'm	not	crazy	.	I	'm	not	 de 	 ment 	 ed 	 	.	I	have	 Char 	 les 	 	 B 	 on 	 net 	 	syndrome	.	''
Well	,	so	I	did	tell	the	 nurse 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	for	me	,	is	a	common	 situ 	 ation 	 	.
I	work	in	 old 	 - 	 age 	 	 home 	 s 	 	,	 large 	 ly 	 	.
I	see	a	lot	of	 elder 	 ly 	 	people	who	are	 hear 	 ing 	 	 impair 	 ed 	 	or	 visual 	 ly 	 	 impair 	 ed 	 	.
 Ab 	 out 	 	10	percent	of	the	 hear 	 ing 	 	 impair 	 ed 	 	people	get	musical	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	.
And	about	10	percent	of	the	 visual 	 ly 	 	 impair 	 ed 	 	people	get	visual	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	.
You	do	n't	have	to	be	 complete 	 ly 	 	blind	,	 on 	 ly 	 	 sufficient 	 ly 	 	 impair 	 ed 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	with	the	original	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	in	the	18th	century	,	 Char 	 les 	 	 B 	 on 	 net 	 	did	not	have	them	.
 Hi 	 s 	 	 grand 	 father 	 	had	these	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	.
 Hi 	 s 	 	 grand 	 father 	 	was	a	 magist 	 rate 	 	,	an	 elder 	 ly 	 	man	.
He	'd	had	cataract	 s 	 urge 	 ry 	 	.
 Hi 	 s 	 	vision	was	 pre 	 tty 	 	poor	.
And	in	1759	,	he	 de 	 scribed 	 	to	his	 grand 	 son 	 	 vari 	 ous 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	he	was	 see 	 ing 	 	.
The	first	thing	he	 s 	 aid 	 	was	he	saw	a	handkerchief	in	 mid 	 air 	 	.
It	was	a	large	blue	handkerchief	with	four	 o 	 range 	 	 circle 	 s 	 	.
And	he	 k 	 new 	 	it	was	a	 hallucin 	 ation 	 	.
You	do	n't	have	 handkerchief 	 s 	 	in	 mid 	 air 	 	.
And	then	he	saw	a	big	wheel	in	 mid 	 air 	 	.
But	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	he	was	n't	 s 	 ure 	 	 whet 	 her 	 	he	was	 hallucin 	 ating 	 	or	not	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	would	fit	in	the	 con 	 text 	 	of	the	 vision 	 s 	 	.
So	on	one	occasion	,	when	his	 grand 	 daughter 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 visit 	 ing 	 	them	,	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	And	who	are	these	 hand 	 some 	 	young	men	with	you	?	''
And	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 Al 	 a 	 s 	 	,	 Grand 	 papa 	 	,	there	are	no	 hand 	 some 	 	young	men	.	''
And	then	the	 hand 	 some 	 	young	men	 disappear 	 ed 	 	.
It	's	typical	of	these	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	that	they	may	come	in	a	flash	and	disappear	in	a	flash	.
 The 	 y 	 	do	n't	 usual 	 ly 	 	 fad 	 e 	 	in	and	out	.
 The 	 y 	 	are	 ra 	 ther 	 	sudden	,	and	they	change	 sudden 	 ly 	 	.
 Char 	 les 	 	 L 	 ull 	 in 	 	,	the	 grand 	 father 	 	,	saw	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	different	 figure 	 s 	 	,	different	 land 	 scapes 	 	of	all	 sort 	 s 	 	.
On	one	occasion	,	he	saw	a	man	in	a	 bath 	 robe 	 	 smok 	 ing 	 	a	pipe	,	and	 real 	 ized 	 	it	was	 him 	 self 	 	.
That	was	the	 on 	 ly 	 	figure	he	 recogn 	 ized 	 	.
On	one	occasion	when	he	was	 walk 	 ing 	 	in	the	 street 	 s 	 	of	Paris	,	he	saw	--	 th 	 is 	 	was	real	--	a	 scaffold 	 ing 	 	.
But	when	he	got	back	home	,	he	saw	a	 miniatur 	 e 	 	of	the	 scaffold 	 ing 	 	six	 inch 	 es 	 	high	,	on	his	 stud 	 y 	 	table	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 re 	 petition 	 	of	 per 	 ception 	 	is	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 pal 	 inopsia 	 	.
With	him	and	with	 Rosa 	 lie 	 	,	what	 seem 	 s 	 	to	be	going	on	--	and	 Rosa 	 lie 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	What	's	going	on	?	''	--	and	I	 s 	 aid 	 	that	 a 	 s 	 	you	lose	vision	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	visual	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	brain	are	no	 long 	 er 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	any	 in 	 put 	 	,	they	 be 	 come 	 	 hyper 	 active 	 	and	 excit 	 able 	 	,	and	they	start	to	fire	 spontane 	 ously 	 	.
And	you	start	to	see	 thing 	 s 	 	.
The	 thing 	 s 	 	you	see	can	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	 in 	 de 	 ed 	 	.
With	 an 	 other 	 	patient	of	mine	,	who	,	 al 	 so 	 	had	some	vision	,	the	vision	she	had	could	be	 disturb 	 ing 	 	.
On	one	occasion	,	she	 s 	 aid 	 	she	saw	a	man	in	a	 strip 	 ed 	 	shirt	in	a	restaurant	.
And	he	 turn 	 ed 	 	around	.	And	then	he	 divid 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	six	 figure 	 s 	 	in	 strip 	 ed 	 	 shirt 	 s 	 	,	who	 start 	 ed 	 	 walk 	 ing 	 	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	her	.
And	then	the	six	 figure 	 s 	 	came	together	 aga 	 in 	 	,	like	a	 concert 	 ina 	 	.
 O 	 nce 	 	,	when	she	was	 driv 	 ing 	 	,	or	 ra 	 ther 	 	,	her	husband	was	 driv 	 ing 	 	,	the	road	 divid 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	four	and	she	felt	 her 	 self 	 	going	 simultaneous 	 ly 	 	up	four	 road 	 s 	 	.
She	had	 ver 	 y 	 	mobile	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
A	lot	of	them	had	to	do	with	a	car	.
 Some 	 time 	 s 	 	she	would	see	a	 teen 	 age 	 	boy	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	on	the	hood	of	the	car	.
He	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 ten 	 acious 	 	and	he	 move 	 d 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	 grace 	 fully 	 	when	the	car	 turn 	 ed 	 	.
And	then	when	they	came	to	a	stop	,	the	boy	would	do	a	sudden	 vert 	 ical 	 	 take 	 off 	 	,	100	foot	in	the	air	,	and	then	disappear	.
 An 	 other 	 	patient	of	mine	had	a	different	sort	of	 hallucin 	 ation 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	was	a	woman	who	did	n't	have	trouble	with	her	 eye 	 s 	 	,	but	the	visual	 part 	 s 	 	of	her	brain	,	a	little	tumor	in	the	 occip 	 ital 	 	cortex	.
And	,	above	all	,	she	would	see	 cartoon 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	 cartoon 	 s 	 	would	be	 trans 	 parent 	 	and	would	cover	half	the	visual	field	,	like	a	screen	.
And	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	she	saw	 cartoon 	 s 	 	of	 Ker 	 mit 	 	the	Frog	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	I	do	n't	watch	 Se 	 same 	 	Street	,	but	she	made	a	point	of	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	Why	 Ker 	 mit 	 	?	''	She	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 Ker 	 mit 	 	the	Frog	 mean 	 s 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	me	.
You	know	,	I	was	 wonder 	 ing 	 	about	 Freud 	 ian 	 	 determi 	 nant 	 s 	 	.
Why	 Ker 	 mit 	 	?
 Ker 	 mit 	 	the	Frog	 mean 	 s 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	me	.	''
She	did	n't	mind	the	 cartoon 	 s 	 	too	much	.
But	what	did	disturb	her	was	she	got	 ver 	 y 	 	 persist 	 ent 	 	 image 	 s 	 	or	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	of	 face 	 s 	 	and	 a 	 s 	 	with	 Rosa 	 lie 	 	,	the	 face 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	often	 de 	 form 	 ed 	 	,	with	 ver 	 y 	 	large	 tee 	 th 	 	or	 ver 	 y 	 	large	 eye 	 s 	 	.
And	these	 frighten 	 ed 	 	her	.
Well	,	what	is	going	on	with	these	people	?
 A 	 s 	 	a	physician	,	I	have	to	try	and	define	what	's	going	on	,	and	to	 re 	 assure 	 	people	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	to	 re 	 assure 	 	them	that	they	're	not	going	 insan 	 e 	 	.
 Some 	 thing 	 	like	10	percent	,	 a 	 s 	 	I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	of	 visual 	 ly 	 	 impair 	 ed 	 	people	get	these	.
But	no	more	than	one	percent	of	the	people	 acknowledg 	 e 	 	them	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	are	 af 	 raid 	 	they	will	be	 s 	 een 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 insan 	 e 	 	or	 some 	 thing 	 	.
And	if	they	do	 ment 	 ion 	 	them	to	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 doctor 	 s 	 	they	may	be	 mis 	 diagnos 	 ed 	 	.
In	 part 	 icular 	 	,	the	 not 	 ion 	 	is	that	if	you	see	 thing 	 s 	 	or	hear	 thing 	 s 	 	,	you	're	going	mad	,	but	the	 psycho 	 tic 	 	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	are	 quit 	 e 	 	different	.
 Psycho 	 tic 	 	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	they	are	visual	or	vocal	,	they	address	you	.	 The 	 y 	 	 accus 	 e 	 	you	.
 The 	 y 	 	seduce	you	.	 The 	 y 	 	 humil 	 iate 	 	you	.
 The 	 y 	 	 j 	 eer 	 	at	you	.
You	interact	with	them	.
There	is	 non 	 e 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	quality	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 address 	 ed 	 	with	these	 Char 	 les 	 	 B 	 on 	 net 	 	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	.
There	is	a	film	.	You	're	 see 	 ing 	 	a	film	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	you	,	or	that	's	how	people	think	about	it	.
There	is	 al 	 so 	 	a	rare	thing	 call 	 ed 	 	temporal	lobe	epilepsy	,	and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	,	if	one	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	one	may	feel	 one 	 self 	 	 transport 	 ed 	 	back	to	a	time	and	place	in	the	past	.
You	're	at	a	 part 	 icular 	 	road	junction	.
You	smell	 chest 	 nuts 	 	 roast 	 ing 	 	.
You	hear	the	traffic	.	All	the	 sense 	 s 	 	are	 involve 	 d 	 	.
And	you	're	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	your	girl	.
And	it	's	that	 Tu 	 es 	 day 	 	 even 	 ing 	 	back	in	1982	.
And	the	temporal	lobe	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	are	 all 	 - 	 sense 	 	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	,	full	of	 feel 	 ing 	 	,	full	of	 familiar 	 ity 	 	,	 locate 	 d 	 	in	space	and	time	,	 cohere 	 nt 	 	,	 dramat 	 ic 	 	.
The	 Char 	 les 	 	 B 	 on 	 net 	 	 one 	 s 	 	are	 quit 	 e 	 	different	.
So	in	the	 Char 	 les 	 	 B 	 on 	 net 	 	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	,	you	have	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 level 	 s 	 	,	from	the	 geo 	 metric 	 al 	 	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	--	the	pink	and	blue	 square 	 s 	 	the	woman	had	--	up	to	 quit 	 e 	 	elaborate	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	with	 figure 	 s 	 	and	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 face 	 s 	 	.
 Face 	 s 	 	,	and	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 de 	 form 	 ed 	 	 face 	 s 	 	,	are	the	single	 common 	 est 	 	thing	in	these	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	.
And	one	of	the	second	 common 	 est 	 	is	 cartoon 	 s 	 	.
So	,	what	is	going	on	?
 Fascinat 	 ing 	 ly 	 	,	in	the	last	few	 year 	 s 	 	,	it	's	 be 	 en 	 	possible	to	do	functional	brain	 image 	 ry 	 	,	to	do	 f 	 MRI 	 	on	people	 a 	 s 	 	they	are	 hallucin 	 ating 	 	.
And	in	fact	,	to	find	that	different	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	visual	brain	are	 activate 	 d 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	are	 hallucin 	 ating 	 	.
When	people	have	these	simple	 geo 	 metric 	 al 	 	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	,	the	 prim 	 ary 	 	visual	cortex	is	 activate 	 d 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	part	of	the	brain	which	 perceive 	 s 	 	 edge 	 s 	 	and	 pattern 	 s 	 	.
You	do	n't	form	 image 	 s 	 	with	your	 prim 	 ary 	 	visual	cortex	.
When	 image 	 s 	 	are	 form 	 ed 	 	,	a	 high 	 er 	 	part	of	the	visual	cortex	is	 involve 	 d 	 	in	the	temporal	lobe	.
And	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	one	area	of	the	temporal	lobe	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 f 	 usi 	 form 	 	 gy 	 rus 	 	.
And	it	's	known	that	if	people	have	damage	in	the	 f 	 usi 	 form 	 	 gy 	 rus 	 	,	they	 may 	 be 	 	lose	the	ability	to	 recogn 	 ize 	 	 face 	 s 	 	.
But	if	there	is	an	 ab 	 normal 	 	activity	in	the	 f 	 usi 	 form 	 	 gy 	 rus 	 	,	they	may	 hallucin 	 ate 	 	 face 	 s 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	you	find	in	some	of	these	people	.
There	is	an	area	in	the	 an 	 terior 	 	part	of	 th 	 is 	 	 gy 	 rus 	 	where	 tee 	 th 	 	and	 eye 	 s 	 	are	 represent 	 ed 	 	,	and	that	part	of	the	 gy 	 rus 	 	is	 activate 	 d 	 	when	people	get	the	 de 	 form 	 ed 	 	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	.
There	is	 an 	 other 	 	part	of	the	brain	which	is	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	 activate 	 d 	 	when	one	 s 	 ees 	 	 cartoon 	 s 	 	.
It	's	 activate 	 d 	 	when	one	 recogn 	 ize 	 s 	 	 cartoon 	 s 	 	,	when	one	 draw 	 s 	 	 cartoon 	 s 	 	,	and	when	one	 hallucin 	 ates 	 	them	.
It	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	that	that	should	be	specific	.
There	are	other	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	brain	which	are	 specific 	 ally 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	with	the	 re 	 cognition 	 	and	 hallucin 	 ation 	 	of	 building 	 s 	 	and	 land 	 scapes 	 	.
 A 	 round 	 	1970	,	it	was	found	that	there	 we 	 re 	 	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	brain	,	but	 part 	 icular 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	.
``	Face	 cell 	 s 	 	''	 we 	 re 	 	 discover 	 ed 	 	around	1970	.
And	now	we	know	that	there	are	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	other	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 cell 	 s 	 	,	which	can	be	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	specific	.
So	you	may	not	 on 	 ly 	 	have	``	car	''	 cell 	 s 	 	,	you	may	have	``	 A 	 s 	 ton 	 	 Mart 	 in 	 	''	 cell 	 s 	 	.
I	saw	an	 A 	 s 	 ton 	 	 Mart 	 in 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 morn 	 ing 	 	.
I	had	to	 br 	 ing 	 	it	in	.
And	now	it	's	in	there	 some 	 where 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	at	 th 	 is 	 	level	,	in	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 infer 	 o 	 temporal 	 	cortex	,	there	are	 on 	 ly 	 	visual	 image 	 s 	 	,	or	 fig 	 ments 	 	or	 fragment 	 s 	 	.
It	's	 on 	 ly 	 	at	 high 	 er 	 	 level 	 s 	 	that	the	other	 sense 	 s 	 	join	in	and	there	are	 connect 	 ions 	 	with	 memor 	 y 	 	and	emotion	.
And	in	the	 Char 	 les 	 	 B 	 on 	 net 	 	syndrome	,	you	do	n't	go	to	 t 	 hose 	 	 high 	 er 	 	 level 	 s 	 	.
You	're	in	these	 level 	 s 	 	of	 infer 	 ior 	 	visual	cortex	where	you	have	 thousand 	 s 	 	and	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	and	 million 	 s 	 	of	 image 	 s 	 	,	or	 fig 	 ments 	 	,	or	 fragment 	 ary 	 	 fig 	 ments 	 	,	all	 neural 	 ly 	 	 encode 	 d 	 	in	 part 	 icular 	 	 cell 	 s 	 	or	small	 cluster 	 s 	 	of	 cell 	 s 	 	.
 Nor 	 mal 	 ly 	 	these	are	all	part	of	the	 integrate 	 d 	 	stream	of	 per 	 ception 	 	,	or	 imagin 	 ation 	 	,	and	one	is	not	conscious	of	them	.
It	is	 on 	 ly 	 	if	one	is	 visual 	 ly 	 	 impair 	 ed 	 	or	blind	that	the	process	is	 interrupt 	 ed 	 	.
And	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 get 	 ting 	 	normal	 per 	 ception 	 	,	you	're	 get 	 ting 	 	an	 anarch 	 ic 	 	,	 convuls 	 ive 	 	 stimul 	 ation 	 	,	or	 re 	 lease 	 	,	of	all	of	these	visual	 cell 	 s 	 	in	the	 infer 	 o 	 temporal 	 	cortex	.
So	,	 sudden 	 ly 	 	you	see	a	face	.	 Sud 	 den 	 ly 	 	you	see	a	car	.
 Sud 	 den 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	 sudden 	 ly 	 	that	.
The	mind	 do 	 es 	 	 it 	 s 	 	best	to	organize	and	to	give	some	sort	of	 cohere 	 nce 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	not	 terr 	 ibly 	 	 success 	 fully 	 	.
When	these	 we 	 re 	 	first	 de 	 scribed 	 	,	it	was	thought	that	they	could	be	 interpret 	 ed 	 	like	 dream 	 s 	 	.
But	in	fact	people	say	,	``	I	do	n't	 recogn 	 ize 	 	the	people	.	I	ca	n't	form	any	 associ 	 ations 	 	.	''
``	 Ker 	 mit 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	me	.	''
You	do	n't	get	 any 	 where 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	of	them	 a 	 s 	 	 dream 	 s 	 	.
Well	,	I	've	more	or	less	 s 	 aid 	 	what	I	 want 	 ed 	 	.
I	think	I	just	want	to	recapitulate	and	say	 th 	 is 	 	is	common	.
Think	of	the	number	of	blind	people	.
There	must	be	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	blind	people	who	have	these	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	,	but	are	too	 scar 	 ed 	 	to	 ment 	 ion 	 	them	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	sort	of	thing	 need 	 s 	 	to	be	 br 	 ought 	 	 in 	 to 	 	notice	,	for	 patient 	 s 	 	,	for	 doctor 	 s 	 	,	for	the	public	.
 Fin 	 ally 	 	,	I	think	they	are	 infinite 	 ly 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	and	 valu 	 able 	 	,	for	giving	one	some	 in 	 sight 	 	 a 	 s 	 	to	how	the	brain	 work 	 s 	 	.
 Char 	 les 	 	 B 	 on 	 net 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	250	 year 	 s 	 	ago	--	he	 wonder 	 ed 	 	how	,	 think 	 ing 	 	these	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	,	how	,	 a 	 s 	 	he	put	it	,	the	theater	of	the	mind	could	be	generated	by	the	 machine 	 ry 	 	of	the	brain	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	250	 year 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	I	think	we	're	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	 glimps 	 e 	 	how	 th 	 is 	 	is	 d 	 one 	 	.
 Thank 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
Chris	 And 	 er 	 son 	 	:	That	was	 super 	 b 	 	.	Thank	you	so	much	.
You	speak	about	these	 thing 	 s 	 	with	so	much	 in 	 sight 	 	and	 empath 	 y 	 	for	your	 patient 	 s 	 	.
 Hav 	 e 	 	you	 your 	 self 	 	 experience 	 d 	 	any	of	the	 syndrome 	 s 	 	you	write	about	?
 O 	 liver 	 	Sacks	:	I	was	 af 	 raid 	 	you	'd	ask	that	.
Well	,	 yea 	 h 	 	,	a	lot	of	them	.
And	 actual 	 ly 	 	I	'm	a	little	 visual 	 ly 	 	 impair 	 ed 	 	 my 	 self 	 	.
I	'm	blind	in	one	eye	,	and	not	 terr 	 ibly 	 	good	in	the	other	.
And	I	see	the	 geo 	 metric 	 al 	 	 hallucin 	 ations 	 	.
But	they	stop	there	.
CA	:	And	they	do	n't	disturb	you	?
 Be 	 cause 	 	you	understand	what	's	 do 	 ing 	 	it	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	you	 worri 	 ed 	 	?
OS	:	Well	they	do	n't	disturb	me	any	more	than	my	 tin 	 nit 	 us 	 	,	which	I	 ignor 	 e 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	 occasion 	 ally 	 	interest	me	,	and	I	have	 man 	 y 	 	 picture 	 s 	 	of	them	in	my	 note 	 book 	 s 	 	.
I	've	gone	and	had	an	 f 	 MRI 	 	 my 	 self 	 	,	to	see	how	my	visual	cortex	is	taking	over	.
And	when	I	see	all	these	 hexagon 	 s 	 	and	complex	 thing 	 s 	 	,	which	I	 al 	 so 	 	have	,	in	visual	migraine	,	I	wonder	 whet 	 her 	 	 every 	 one 	 	 s 	 ees 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	 whet 	 her 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	like	cave	art	or	 orna 	 mental 	 	art	may	have	 be 	 en 	 	derived	from	them	a	bit	.
CA	:	That	was	an	 utter 	 ly 	 	,	 utter 	 ly 	 	 fasci 	 nating 	 	talk	.
Thank	you	so	much	for	sharing	.

 Sal 	 man 	 	Khan	:	Let	's	use	video	to	 re 	 invent 	 	education
The	Khan	Academy	is	most	known	for	 it 	 s 	 	 collect 	 ion 	 	of	 video 	 s 	 	,	so	before	I	go	any	further	,	let	me	show	you	a	little	bit	of	a	montage	.
 Sal 	 man 	 	Khan	:	So	the	 hypo 	 ten 	 use 	 	is	now	going	to	be	five	.
 Th 	 is 	 	animal	's	 fossil 	 s 	 	are	 on 	 ly 	 	found	in	 th 	 is 	 	area	of	South	America	--	a	nice	clean	band	here	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	part	of	 Afri 	 ca 	 	.
We	can	integrate	over	the	surface	,	and	the	 not 	 ation 	 	 usual 	 ly 	 	is	a	capital	 sig 	 ma 	 	.

Oh	look	,	there	's	 an 	 other 	 	 galax 	 y 	 	.
And	for	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	is	 the 	 ir 	 	30	million	,	plus	the	20	million	 dollar 	 s 	 	from	the	American	 manufactur 	 er 	 	.
If	 th 	 is 	 	 do 	 es 	 	not	blow	your	mind	,	then	you	have	no	emotion	.
 S 	 K 	 	:	We	now	have	on	the	order	of	2,200	 video 	 s 	 	 cover 	 ing 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	from	 bas 	 ic 	 	arithmetic	all	the	way	to	vector	 calcul 	 us 	 	and	some	of	the	stuff	you	saw	there	.
We	have	a	million	 student 	 s 	 	a	month	using	the	 s 	 ite 	 	,	 watch 	 ing 	 	on	the	order	of	100	to	200,000	 video 	 s 	 	a	day	.
But	what	we	're	going	to	talk	about	in	 th 	 is 	 	is	how	we	're	going	to	the	next	level	.
But	before	I	do	that	,	I	want	to	talk	a	little	bit	about	 re 	 ally 	 	just	how	I	got	 start 	 ed 	 	.
And	some	of	you	all	might	know	,	about	five	 year 	 s 	 	ago	I	was	an	analyst	at	a	 hedg 	 e 	 	fund	,	and	I	was	in	 Bo 	 s 	 ton 	 	,	and	I	was	 tutor 	 ing 	 	my	 cousin 	 s 	 	in	New	Orleans	,	 remote 	 ly 	 	.
And	I	 start 	 ed 	 	 put 	 ting 	 	the	first	YouTube	 video 	 s 	 	up	 re 	 ally 	 	just	 a 	 s 	 	a	kind	of	 nice 	 - 	 to 	 - 	 have 	 	,	just	a	supplement	for	my	 cousin 	 s 	 	--	 some 	 thing 	 	that	might	give	them	a	 re 	 fresh 	 er 	 	or	 some 	 thing 	 	.
And	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	I	put	 t 	 hose 	 	first	YouTube	 video 	 s 	 	up	,	 some 	 thing 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	--	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	bunch	of	 interest 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	.
The	first	was	the	 feed 	 back 	 	from	my	 cousin 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	told	me	that	they	 prefer 	 red 	 	me	on	YouTube	than	in	person	.
And	once	you	get	over	the	 back 	 hand 	 ed 	 	nature	of	that	,	there	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 pro 	 found 	 	there	.
 The 	 y 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	that	they	 prefer 	 red 	 	the	 autom 	 ated 	 	version	of	 the 	 ir 	 	cousin	to	 the 	 ir 	 	cousin	.
At	first	,	it	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 un 	 intuitive 	 	,	but	when	you	 actual 	 ly 	 	think	about	it	from	 the 	 ir 	 	point	of	view	,	it	 make 	 s 	 	a	ton	of	sense	.
You	have	 th 	 is 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	where	now	they	can	pause	and	repeat	 the 	 ir 	 	cousin	,	 with 	 out 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 	like	they	're	 was 	 ting 	 	my	time	.
If	they	have	to	review	 some 	 thing 	 	that	they	should	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	a	couple	of	 week 	 s 	 	ago	,	or	 may 	 be 	 	a	couple	of	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	they	do	n't	have	to	be	 embarrass 	 ed 	 	and	ask	 the 	 ir 	 	cousin	.
 The 	 y 	 	can	just	watch	 t 	 hose 	 	 video 	 s 	 	.	If	they	're	 bor 	 ed 	 	,	they	can	go	 a 	 head 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	can	watch	it	at	 the 	 ir 	 	own	time	,	at	 the 	 ir 	 	own	pace	.
And	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	 l 	 east 	 	 appreciate 	 d 	 	 a 	 spect 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 not 	 ion 	 	that	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	time	,	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	time	that	you	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	get	your	brain	around	a	new	 con 	 cept 	 	,	the	 ver 	 y 	 	last	thing	you	need	is	 an 	 other 	 	human	 be 	 ing 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	Do	you	understand	 th 	 is 	 	?	''
And	that	's	what	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	with	the	 interact 	 ion 	 	with	my	 cousin 	 s 	 	before	,	and	now	they	can	just	do	it	in	the	 in 	 timacy 	 	of	 the 	 ir 	 	own	room	.
The	other	thing	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	is	--	I	put	them	on	YouTube	just	--	I	saw	no	reason	to	make	it	private	,	so	I	let	other	people	watch	it	,	and	then	people	 start 	 ed 	 	 s 	 tumbling 	 	on	it	,	and	I	 start 	 ed 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	some	 comment 	 s 	 	and	some	 letter 	 s 	 	and	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 feed 	 back 	 	from	random	people	from	around	the	world	.
And	these	are	just	a	few	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	from	one	of	the	original	 calcul 	 us 	 	 video 	 s 	 	.
And	 some 	 one 	 	wrote	just	on	YouTube	--	it	was	a	YouTube	comment	:	``	First	time	I	 smil 	 ed 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	a	 deriv 	 ative 	 	.	''
And	let	's	pause	here	.
 Th 	 is 	 	person	did	a	 deriv 	 ative 	 	and	then	they	 smil 	 ed 	 	.
And	then	in	a	 respons 	 e 	 	to	that	same	comment	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	on	the	 th 	 read 	 	.
You	can	go	on	YouTube	and	look	at	these	 comment 	 s 	 	--	 some 	 one 	 	else	wrote	:	``	 Sam 	 e 	 	thing	here	.
I	 actual 	 ly 	 	got	a	natural	high	and	a	good	mood	for	the	entire	day	.
Since	I	remember	 see 	 ing 	 	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	 m 	 atrix 	 	text	in	class	,	and	here	I	'm	all	like	,	'I	know	 k 	 ung 	 	fu	.	'	''	And	we	get	a	lot	of	 feed 	 back 	 	all	 a 	 long 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	lines	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 clear 	 ly 	 	was	 help 	 ing 	 	people	.
But	then	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	 view 	 er 	 ship 	 	 ke 	 pt 	 	growing	and	 ke 	 pt 	 	growing	,	I	 start 	 ed 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 letter 	 s 	 	from	people	,	and	it	was	 start 	 ing 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	clear	that	it	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	more	than	just	a	 nice 	 - 	 to 	 - 	 have 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	just	an	excerpt	from	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 letter 	 s 	 	.
``	My	12	 year 	 - 	 old 	 	son	 ha 	 s 	 	 aut 	 ism 	 	and	 ha 	 s 	 	had	a	 terr 	 ible 	 	time	with	math	.
We	have	 tri 	 ed 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	,	 view 	 ed 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	,	 b 	 ought 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	.
We	 s 	 tumble 	 d 	 	on	your	video	on	 decimal 	 s 	 	and	it	got	through	.
 Th 	 en 	 	we	went	on	to	the	 dread 	 ed 	 	 fraction 	 s 	 	.	 Aga 	 in 	 	,	he	got	it	.
We	could	not	 believ 	 e 	 	it	.
He	is	so	 excit 	 ed 	 	.	''
And	so	you	can	imagine	,	here	I	was	an	analyst	at	a	 hedg 	 e 	 	fund	.
It	was	 ver 	 y 	 	strange	for	me	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	of	social	value	.
But	I	was	 excit 	 ed 	 	,	so	I	 ke 	 pt 	 	going	.
And	then	a	few	other	 thing 	 s 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	to	dawn	on	me	.
That	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	would	it	help	my	 cousin 	 s 	 	right	now	,	or	these	people	who	are	 s 	 end 	 ing 	 	 letter 	 s 	 	,	but	that	 th 	 is 	 	content	will	never	go	old	,	that	it	could	help	 the 	 ir 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	or	 the 	 ir 	 	 grand 	 kid 	 s 	 	.
If	 Isa 	 ac 	 	 New 	 ton 	 	had	 d 	 one 	 	YouTube	 video 	 s 	 	on	 calcul 	 us 	 	,	I	would	n't	have	to	.
 Assu 	 ming 	 	he	was	good	.	We	do	n't	know	.
The	other	thing	that	 happen 	 ed 	 	--	and	even	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	,	I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 Oka 	 y 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	it	's	a	good	supplement	.
It	's	good	for	 motiv 	 ated 	 	 student 	 s 	 	.
It	's	good	for	 may 	 be 	 	home	 school 	 ers 	 	.	''
But	I	did	n't	think	it	would	be	 some 	 thing 	 	that	would	 some 	 how 	 	penetrate	the	 class 	 room 	 	.
But	then	I	 start 	 ed 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	 letter 	 s 	 	from	 teacher 	 s 	 	.
And	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	would	write	,	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	We	've	used	your	 video 	 s 	 	to	flip	the	 class 	 room 	 	.
You	've	 give 	 n 	 	the	 lectur 	 es 	 	,	so	now	what	we	do	...	``	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	could	happen	in	every	 class 	 room 	 	in	America	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	--	``	...	what	I	do	is	I	assign	the	 lectur 	 es 	 	for	 home 	 work 	 	,	and	what	used	to	be	 home 	 work 	 	,	I	now	have	the	 student 	 s 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	in	the	 class 	 room 	 	.	''
And	I	want	to	pause	here	for	--	I	want	to	pause	here	for	a	second	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	a	couple	of	 interest 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
One	,	when	 t 	 hose 	 	 teacher 	 s 	 	are	 do 	 ing 	 	that	,	there	's	the	obvious	benefit	--	the	benefit	that	now	 the 	 ir 	 	 student 	 s 	 	can	enjoy	the	 video 	 s 	 	in	the	way	that	my	 cousin 	 s 	 	did	.
 The 	 y 	 	can	pause	,	repeat	at	 the 	 ir 	 	own	pace	,	at	 the 	 ir 	 	own	time	.
But	the	more	 interest 	 ing 	 	thing	is	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 un 	 intuitive 	 	thing	when	you	talk	about	technology	in	the	 class 	 room 	 	--	by	 re 	 moving 	 	the	 one 	 - 	 s 	 ize 	 - 	 fit 	 s 	 - 	 all 	 	 lectur 	 e 	 	from	the	 class 	 room 	 	and	 lett 	 ing 	 	 student 	 s 	 	have	a	 self 	 - 	 pac 	 ed 	 	 lectur 	 e 	 	at	home	,	and	then	when	you	go	to	the	 class 	 room 	 	,	 lett 	 ing 	 	them	do	work	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	the	teacher	walk	around	,	 hav 	 ing 	 	the	 peer 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	be	able	to	interact	with	each	other	,	these	 teacher 	 s 	 	have	used	technology	to	 human 	 ize 	 	the	 class 	 room 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	took	a	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	 de 	 human 	 izing 	 	experience	--	30	 kid 	 s 	 	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 finger 	 s 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	lips	,	not	 allow 	 ed 	 	to	interact	with	each	other	.
A	teacher	,	no	matter	how	good	,	 ha 	 s 	 	to	give	 th 	 is 	 	 one 	 - 	 s 	 ize 	 - 	 fit 	 s 	 - 	 all 	 	 lectur 	 e 	 	to	30	 student 	 s 	 	--	blank	 face 	 s 	 	,	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	 ant 	 agon 	 istic 	 	--	and	now	it	's	a	human	experience	.
 N 	 ow 	 	they	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 interact 	 ing 	 	with	each	other	.
So	once	the	Khan	Academy	--	I	quit	my	job	and	we	 turn 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	real	 organ 	 ization 	 	--	we	're	a	 not 	 - 	 for 	 - 	 profit 	 	--	the	question	is	,	how	do	we	take	 th 	 is 	 	to	the	next	level	?
How	do	we	take	what	 t 	 hose 	 	 teacher 	 s 	 	are	 do 	 ing 	 	to	 the 	 ir 	 	natural	 con 	 clusion 	 	?
And	so	what	I	'm	 show 	 ing 	 	you	over	here	,	these	are	actual	 exercis 	 es 	 	that	I	 start 	 ed 	 	writing	for	my	 cousin 	 s 	 	.
The	 one 	 s 	 	I	 start 	 ed 	 	 we 	 re 	 	much	more	primitive	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	more	 compete 	 nt 	 	version	of	it	.
But	the	paradigm	here	is	,	we	'll	generate	 a 	 s 	 	 man 	 y 	 	 question 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	you	need	 un 	 til 	 	you	get	that	 con 	 cept 	 	,	 un 	 til 	 	you	get	10	in	a	row	.
And	the	Khan	Academy	 video 	 s 	 	are	there	.
You	get	 hint 	 s 	 	,	the	actual	 step 	 s 	 	for	that	problem	,	if	you	do	n't	know	how	to	do	it	.
But	the	paradigm	here	,	it	 seem 	 s 	 	like	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	thing	:	10	in	a	row	,	you	move	on	.
But	it	's	 fundamental 	 ly 	 	different	than	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	 class 	 rooms 	 	right	now	.
In	a	 tradition 	 al 	 	 class 	 room 	 	,	you	have	a	couple	of	 home 	 work 	 	,	 home 	 work 	 	,	 lectur 	 e 	 	,	 home 	 work 	 	,	 lectur 	 e 	 	,	and	then	you	have	a	 snap 	 shot 	 	 ex 	 am 	 	.
And	that	 ex 	 am 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	you	get	a	70	percent	,	an	80	percent	,	a	90	percent	or	a	95	percent	,	the	class	 move 	 s 	 	on	to	the	next	 top 	 ic 	 	.
And	even	that	95	percent	student	,	what	was	the	five	percent	they	did	n't	know	?
 May 	 be 	 	they	did	n't	know	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	you	raise	 some 	 thing 	 	to	the	zero	power	.
And	then	you	go	build	on	that	in	the	next	 con 	 cept 	 	.
That	's	 analog 	 ous 	 	to	imagine	 learn 	 ing 	 	to	ride	a	 bi 	 cycle 	 	,	and	 may 	 be 	 	I	give	you	a	 lectur 	 e 	 	 a 	 head 	 	of	time	,	and	I	give	you	that	 bi 	 cycle 	 	for	two	 week 	 s 	 	.
And	then	I	come	back	after	two	 week 	 s 	 	,	and	I	say	,	``	Well	,	let	's	see	.	You	're	 hav 	 ing 	 	trouble	taking	left	 turn 	 s 	 	.
You	ca	n't	 quit 	 e 	 	stop	.
You	're	an	80	percent	 bi 	 cyclist 	 	.	''
So	I	put	a	big	C	stamp	on	your	 fore 	 head 	 	and	then	I	say	,	``	 He 	 re 	 	's	a	 uni 	 cycle 	 	.	''
But	 a 	 s 	 	 ridicul 	 ous 	 	 a 	 s 	 	that	 sound 	 s 	 	,	that	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	our	 class 	 rooms 	 	right	now	.
And	the	idea	is	you	fast	forward	and	good	 student 	 s 	 	start	 fail 	 ing 	 	algebra	all	of	a	sudden	and	start	 fail 	 ing 	 	 calcul 	 us 	 	all	of	a	sudden	,	 de 	 spite 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	smart	,	 de 	 spite 	 	 hav 	 ing 	 	good	 teacher 	 s 	 	,	and	it	's	 usual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	have	these	Swiss	cheese	 gap 	 s 	 	that	 ke 	 pt 	 	building	 through 	 out 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 found 	 ation 	 	.
So	our	model	is	learn	math	the	way	you	'd	learn	 any 	 thing 	 	,	like	the	way	you	would	learn	a	 bi 	 cycle 	 	.
Stay	on	that	 bi 	 cycle 	 	.	Fall	off	that	 bi 	 cycle 	 	.
Do	it	 a 	 s 	 	long	 a 	 s 	 	 necess 	 ary 	 	 un 	 til 	 	you	have	 master 	 y 	 	.
The	 tradition 	 al 	 	model	,	it	 penal 	 ize 	 s 	 	you	for	 experiment 	 ation 	 	and	failure	,	but	it	 do 	 es 	 	not	expect	 master 	 y 	 	.
We	 encourag 	 e 	 	you	to	experiment	.	We	 encourag 	 e 	 	you	to	failure	.
But	we	do	expect	 master 	 y 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	just	 an 	 other 	 	one	of	the	 modul 	 es 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 tri 	 go 	 no 	 metry 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	shifting	and	 reflect 	 ing 	 	 function 	 s 	 	.
And	they	all	fit	together	.
We	have	about	90	of	these	right	now	.
And	you	can	go	to	the	 s 	 ite 	 	right	now	.	It	's	all	free	.	Not	 try 	 ing 	 	to	sell	 any 	 thing 	 	.
But	the	general	idea	is	that	they	all	fit	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	knowledge	map	.
That	top	 no 	 de 	 	right	there	,	that	's	 liter 	 ally 	 	single	digit	 add 	 ition 	 	.
It	's	like	one	plus	one	is	equal	to	two	.
And	the	paradigm	is	,	once	you	get	10	in	a	row	on	that	,	it	 keep 	 s 	 	 forward 	 ing 	 	you	to	more	and	more	 advance 	 d 	 	 modul 	 es 	 	.
So	if	you	keep	further	down	the	knowledge	map	,	we	're	 get 	 ting 	 	 in 	 to 	 	more	 advance 	 d 	 	arithmetic	.
 Fur 	 ther 	 	down	,	you	start	 get 	 ting 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 pre 	 - 	 algebra 	 	and	early	algebra	.
 Fur 	 ther 	 	down	,	you	start	 get 	 ting 	 	 in 	 to 	 	algebra	one	,	algebra	two	,	a	little	bit	of	 pre 	 calcul 	 us 	 	.
And	the	idea	is	,	from	 th 	 is 	 	we	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	teach	 every 	 thing 	 	--	well	,	 every 	 thing 	 	that	can	be	taught	in	 th 	 is 	 	type	of	a	 frame 	 work 	 	.
So	you	can	imagine	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	are	 work 	 ing 	 	on	--	is	from	 th 	 is 	 	knowledge	map	you	have	logic	,	you	have	computer	 programm 	 ing 	 	,	you	have	 gram 	 mar 	 	,	you	have	 genetic 	 s 	 	,	all	based	off	of	that	core	of	,	if	you	know	 th 	 is 	 	and	that	,	now	you	're	ready	for	 th 	 is 	 	next	 con 	 cept 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	that	can	work	well	for	an	individual	 learn 	 er 	 	,	and	I	 encourag 	 e 	 	,	one	,	for	you	to	do	it	with	your	 kid 	 s 	 	,	but	I	 al 	 so 	 	 encourag 	 e 	 	 every 	 one 	 	in	the	audience	to	do	it	 your 	 self 	 	.
It	'll	change	what	 happen 	 s 	 	at	the	 d 	 inner 	 	table	.
But	what	we	want	to	do	is	to	use	the	natural	 con 	 clusion 	 	of	the	 flip 	 ping 	 	of	the	 class 	 room 	 	that	 t 	 hose 	 	early	 teacher 	 s 	 	had	 email 	 ed 	 	me	about	.
And	so	what	I	'm	 show 	 ing 	 	you	here	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	data	from	a	pilot	in	the	 Lo 	 s 	 	 Al 	 to 	 s 	 	school	 di 	 strict 	 	,	where	they	took	two	fifth	grade	 class 	 es 	 	and	two	 seven 	 th 	 	grade	 class 	 es 	 	and	 complete 	 ly 	 	 gutt 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	old	math	curriculum	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	are	n't	using	 text 	 book 	 s 	 	,	they	're	not	 get 	 ting 	 	 one 	 - 	 s 	 ize 	 - 	 fit 	 s 	 - 	 all 	 	 lectur 	 es 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	 do 	 ing 	 	Khan	Academy	,	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	that	 soft 	 ware 	 	,	for	 rough 	 ly 	 	half	of	 the 	 ir 	 	math	class	.
And	I	want	to	make	it	clear	,	we	do	n't	view	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	complete	math	education	.
What	it	 do 	 es 	 	is	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	 Lo 	 s 	 	 Al 	 to 	 s 	 	--	it	 free 	 s 	 	up	time	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	 block 	 ing 	 	and	 tack 	 ling 	 	,	making	 s 	 ure 	 	you	know	how	to	move	through	a	system	of	 equ 	 ations 	 	,	and	it	 free 	 s 	 	up	time	for	the	 simul 	 ations 	 	,	for	the	 game 	 s 	 	,	for	the	 mechanic 	 s 	 	,	for	the	robot	building	,	for	the	estimating	how	high	that	hill	is	based	on	 it 	 s 	 	shadow	.
And	so	the	paradigm	is	the	teacher	 walk 	 s 	 	in	every	day	,	every	kid	 work 	 s 	 	at	 the 	 ir 	 	own	pace	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	live	 dash 	 board 	 	from	 Lo 	 s 	 	 Al 	 to 	 s 	 	school	 di 	 strict 	 	--	and	they	look	at	 th 	 is 	 	 dash 	 board 	 	.
Every	row	is	a	student	.
Every	column	is	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	.
Green	 mean 	 s 	 	the	student	's	 al 	 ready 	 	 profici 	 ent 	 	.
Blue	 mean 	 s 	 	they	're	 work 	 ing 	 	on	it	--	no	need	to	worry	.
Red	 mean 	 s 	 	they	're	 s 	 tuck 	 	.
And	what	the	teacher	 do 	 es 	 	is	 liter 	 ally 	 	just	say	,	``	Let	me	 inter 	 vene 	 	on	the	red	 kid 	 s 	 	.	''
Or	even	better	,	``	Let	me	get	one	of	the	green	 kid 	 s 	 	who	are	 al 	 ready 	 	 profici 	 ent 	 	in	that	 con 	 cept 	 	to	be	the	first	line	of	attack	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	tutor	 the 	 ir 	 	peer	.	''
 N 	 ow 	 	I	come	from	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 data 	 - 	 centric 	 	 re 	 ality 	 	,	so	we	do	n't	want	that	teacher	to	even	go	and	 inter 	 vene 	 	and	have	to	ask	the	kid	awkward	 question 	 s 	 	:	``	Oh	,	what	do	you	not	understand	?	''	or	``	What	do	you	do	understand	?	''
and	all	of	the	rest	.
So	our	paradigm	is	to	 re 	 ally 	 	arm	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	with	 a 	 s 	 	much	data	 a 	 s 	 	possible	--	 re 	 ally 	 	data	that	,	in	 al 	 most 	 	any	other	field	,	is	 expect 	 ed 	 	,	if	you	're	in	finance	or	 market 	 ing 	 	or	 manufactur 	 ing 	 	--	and	so	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	 diagnos 	 e 	 	what	's	wrong	with	the	 student 	 s 	 	so	they	can	make	 the 	 ir 	 	 interact 	 ion 	 	 a 	 s 	 	productive	 a 	 s 	 	possible	.
So	now	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	know	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	the	 student 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	up	to	,	how	long	they	have	 be 	 en 	 	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	every	day	,	what	 video 	 s 	 	have	they	 be 	 en 	 	 watch 	 ing 	 	,	when	did	they	pause	the	 video 	 s 	 	,	what	did	they	stop	 watch 	 ing 	 	,	what	 exercis 	 es 	 	are	they	using	,	what	have	they	 be 	 en 	 	focused	on	?
The	 out 	 er 	 	circle	 show 	 s 	 	what	 exercis 	 es 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	focused	on	.
The	inner	circle	 show 	 s 	 	the	 video 	 s 	 	they	're	focused	on	.
And	the	data	 get 	 s 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	granular	so	you	can	see	the	exact	 problem 	 s 	 	that	the	student	got	right	or	wrong	.
Red	is	wrong	,	blue	is	right	.
The	 left 	 most 	 	question	is	the	first	question	that	the	student	 attempt 	 ed 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	 watch 	 ed 	 	the	video	right	over	there	.
And	then	you	can	see	,	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	,	they	 we 	 re 	 	able	to	get	10	in	a	row	.
It	's	 al 	 most 	 	like	you	can	see	them	 learn 	 ing 	 	over	 t 	 hose 	 	last	10	 problem 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	 al 	 so 	 	got	 fast 	 er 	 	.
The	height	is	how	long	it	took	them	.
So	when	you	talk	about	 self 	 - 	 pac 	 ed 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	,	it	 make 	 s 	 	sense	for	 every 	 one 	 	--	in	 education 	 - 	 speak 	 	,	 different 	 iated 	 	 learn 	 ing 	 	--	but	it	's	kind	of	crazy	when	you	see	it	in	a	 class 	 room 	 	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	every	time	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	 th 	 is 	 	,	in	every	 class 	 room 	 	we	've	 d 	 one 	 	,	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	,	if	you	go	five	 day 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	it	,	there	's	a	group	of	 kid 	 s 	 	who	've	 rac 	 ed 	 	 a 	 head 	 	and	there	's	a	group	of	 kid 	 s 	 	who	are	a	little	bit	 s 	 lower 	 	.
And	in	a	 tradition 	 al 	 	model	,	if	you	did	a	 snap 	 shot 	 	 assess 	 ment 	 	,	you	say	,	``	 Th 	 ese 	 	are	the	 gift 	 ed 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	,	these	are	the	 s 	 low 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	.
 May 	 be 	 	they	should	be	 track 	 ed 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	.
 May 	 be 	 	we	should	put	them	in	different	 class 	 es 	 	.	''
But	when	you	let	every	student	work	at	 the 	 ir 	 	own	pace	--	and	we	see	it	over	and	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	--	you	see	 student 	 s 	 	who	took	a	little	bit	[	of	]	extra	time	on	one	 con 	 cept 	 	or	the	other	,	but	once	they	get	through	that	 con 	 cept 	 	,	they	just	race	 a 	 head 	 	.
And	so	the	same	 kid 	 s 	 	that	you	thought	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 low 	 	six	 week 	 s 	 	ago	,	you	now	would	think	are	 gift 	 ed 	 	.
And	we	're	 see 	 ing 	 	it	over	and	over	and	over	 aga 	 in 	 	.
And	it	 make 	 s 	 	you	 re 	 ally 	 	wonder	how	much	all	of	the	 label 	 s 	 	 may 	 be 	 	a	lot	of	us	have	 benefit 	 ed 	 	from	 we 	 re 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	just	due	to	a	 co 	 incidence 	 	of	time	.
 N 	 ow 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 valu 	 able 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	is	in	a	 di 	 strict 	 	like	 Lo 	 s 	 	 Al 	 to 	 s 	 	,	our	goal	is	to	use	technology	to	 human 	 ize 	 	,	not	just	in	 Lo 	 s 	 	 Al 	 to 	 s 	 	,	but	on	a	global	scale	,	what	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	education	.
And	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	that	kind	of	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	an	 interest 	 ing 	 	point	.
A	lot	of	the	effort	in	 human 	 izing 	 	the	 class 	 room 	 	is	focused	on	 student 	 - 	 to 	 - 	 teacher 	 	 ratio 	 s 	 	.
In	our	mind	,	the	relevant	metric	is	 student 	 - 	 to 	 - 	 valu 	 able 	 - 	 human 	 - 	 time 	 - 	 	 with 	 - 	 the 	 - 	 teacher 	 	ratio	.
So	in	a	 tradition 	 al 	 	model	,	most	of	the	teacher	's	time	is	 s 	 pent 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	 lectur 	 es 	 	and	 grad 	 ing 	 	and	 what 	 not 	 	.
 May 	 be 	 	five	percent	of	 the 	 ir 	 	time	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	next	to	 student 	 s 	 	and	 actual 	 ly 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	with	them	.
 N 	 ow 	 	100	percent	of	 the 	 ir 	 	time	is	.
So	once	 aga 	 in 	 	,	using	technology	,	not	just	 flip 	 ping 	 	the	 class 	 room 	 	,	you	're	 human 	 izing 	 	the	 class 	 room 	 	,	I	'd	 argu 	 e 	 	,	by	a	factor	of	five	or	10	.
And	 a 	 s 	 	 valu 	 able 	 	 a 	 s 	 	that	is	in	 Lo 	 s 	 	 Al 	 to 	 s 	 	,	imagine	what	that	 do 	 es 	 	to	the	adult	 learn 	 er 	 	who	's	 embarrass 	 ed 	 	to	go	back	and	learn	stuff	that	they	should	have	before	,	before	going	back	to	college	.
 Imagin 	 e 	 	what	it	 do 	 es 	 	to	a	street	kid	in	 Cal 	 cut 	 ta 	 	who	 ha 	 s 	 	to	help	his	family	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	day	,	and	that	's	the	reason	why	he	or	she	ca	n't	go	to	school	.
 N 	 ow 	 	they	can	 s 	 pend 	 	two	 hour 	 s 	 	a	day	and	 re 	 mediate 	 	,	or	get	up	to	speed	and	not	feel	 embarrass 	 ed 	 	about	what	they	do	or	do	n't	know	.
 N 	 ow 	 	imagine	what	 happen 	 s 	 	where	--	we	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	the	 peer 	 s 	 	 teach 	 ing 	 	each	other	 in 	 side 	 	of	a	 class 	 room 	 	.
But	 th 	 is 	 	is	all	one	system	.
There	's	no	reason	why	you	ca	n't	have	that	 peer 	 - 	 to 	 - 	 peer 	 	 tutor 	 ing 	 	beyond	that	one	 class 	 room 	 	.
 Imagin 	 e 	 	what	 happen 	 s 	 	if	that	student	in	 Cal 	 cut 	 ta 	 	all	of	a	sudden	can	tutor	your	son	,	or	your	son	can	tutor	that	kid	in	 Cal 	 cut 	 ta 	 	?
And	I	think	what	you	'll	see	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	is	 th 	 is 	 	 not 	 ion 	 	of	a	global	 one 	 - 	 world 	 	 class 	 room 	 	.
And	that	's	 essential 	 ly 	 	what	we	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	build	.
Thank	you	.
Bill	 Gate 	 s 	 	:	I	've	 s 	 een 	 	some	 thing 	 s 	 	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	in	the	system	that	have	to	do	with	 motiv 	 ation 	 	and	 feed 	 back 	 	--	energy	 point 	 s 	 	,	merit	 badge 	 s 	 	.
Tell	me	what	you	're	 think 	 ing 	 	there	.
 S 	 K 	 	:	Oh	 yea 	 h 	 	.	No	,	we	have	an	awesome	team	 work 	 ing 	 	on	it	.
And	I	have	to	make	it	clear	,	it	's	not	just	me	 any 	 more 	 	.
I	'm	still	 do 	 ing 	 	all	the	 video 	 s 	 	,	but	we	have	a	 rock 	 star 	 	team	 do 	 ing 	 	the	 soft 	 ware 	 	.
Yeah	,	we	've	put	a	bunch	of	game	 mechanic 	 s 	 	in	there	where	you	get	these	 badge 	 s 	 	,	we	're	going	to	start	 hav 	 ing 	 	 lead 	 er 	 	 board 	 s 	 	by	area	,	and	you	get	 point 	 s 	 	.
It	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
Just	the	 word 	 ing 	 	of	the	 bad 	 ging 	 	or	how	 man 	 y 	 	 point 	 s 	 	you	get	for	 do 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	,	we	see	on	a	 system 	 - 	 wide 	 	 bas 	 is 	 	,	like	 ten 	 s 	 	of	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	fifth	graders	or	sixth	graders	going	one	direction	or	 an 	 other 	 	,	 depend 	 ing 	 	what	badge	you	give	them	.
 B 	 G 	 	:	And	the	 collabor 	 ation 	 	you	're	 do 	 ing 	 	with	 Lo 	 s 	 	 Al 	 to 	 s 	 	,	how	did	that	come	about	?
 S 	 K 	 	:	 Lo 	 s 	 	 Al 	 to 	 s 	 	,	it	was	kind	of	crazy	.
 O 	 nce 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	,	I	did	n't	expect	it	to	be	used	in	 class 	 rooms 	 	.
 Some 	 one 	 	from	 the 	 ir 	 	board	came	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	What	would	you	do	if	you	had	 cart 	 e 	 	blanche	in	a	 class 	 room 	 	?	''
And	I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Well	,	I	would	just	,	every	student	work	at	 the 	 ir 	 	own	pace	on	 some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	and	we	'd	give	a	 dash 	 board 	 	.	''
And	they	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Oh	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	kind	of	radical	.	We	have	to	think	about	it	.	''
And	me	and	the	rest	of	the	team	 we 	 re 	 	like	,	``	 The 	 y 	 	're	never	going	to	want	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.	''
But	 liter 	 ally 	 	the	next	day	they	 we 	 re 	 	like	,	``	Can	you	start	in	two	 week 	 s 	 	?	''
 B 	 G 	 	:	So	fifth	grade	math	is	where	that	's	going	on	right	now	?
 S 	 K 	 	:	It	's	two	fifth	grade	 class 	 es 	 	and	two	 seven 	 th 	 	grade	 class 	 es 	 	.
And	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	it	at	the	 di 	 strict 	 	level	.
I	think	what	they	're	 excit 	 ed 	 	about	is	they	can	now	follow	these	 kid 	 s 	 	.
It	's	not	an	 on 	 ly 	 - 	 in 	 - 	 school 	 	thing	.
We	've	even	,	on	 Christ 	 ma 	 s 	 	,	we	saw	some	of	the	 kid 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
And	we	can	track	 every 	 thing 	 	.
So	they	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	track	them	 a 	 s 	 	they	go	through	the	entire	 di 	 strict 	 	.
 Th 	 rough 	 	the	 summer 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	they	go	from	one	teacher	to	the	next	,	you	have	 th 	 is 	 	 continu 	 ity 	 	of	data	that	even	at	the	 di 	 strict 	 	level	they	can	see	.
 B 	 G 	 	:	So	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 view 	 s 	 	we	saw	 we 	 re 	 	for	the	teacher	to	go	in	and	track	 actual 	 ly 	 	what	's	going	on	with	 t 	 hose 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	.
So	you	're	 get 	 ting 	 	 feed 	 back 	 	on	 t 	 hose 	 	teacher	 view 	 s 	 	to	see	what	they	think	they	mean	?
 S 	 K 	 	:	Oh	 yea 	 h 	 	.	 Mo 	 st 	 	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 spec 	 s 	 	by	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	.
We	made	some	of	 t 	 hose 	 	for	 student 	 s 	 	so	they	could	see	 the 	 ir 	 	data	,	but	we	have	a	 ver 	 y 	 	tight	design	loop	with	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
And	they	're	 liter 	 ally 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	Hey	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	nice	,	but	...	``	Like	that	focus	graph	,	a	lot	of	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	I	have	a	 feel 	 ing 	 	that	a	lot	of	the	 kid 	 s 	 	are	 jump 	 ing 	 	around	and	not	 focus 	 ing 	 	on	one	 top 	 ic 	 	.	''
So	we	made	that	focus	 dia 	 gram 	 	.
So	it	's	all	 be 	 en 	 	 teacher 	 - 	 driven 	 	.
It	's	 be 	 en 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	crazy	.
 B 	 G 	 	:	 I 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	ready	for	prime	time	?
Do	you	think	a	lot	of	 class 	 es 	 	next	school	year	should	try	 th 	 is 	 	thing	out	?
 S 	 K 	 	:	Yeah	,	it	's	ready	.
We	've	got	a	million	people	on	the	 s 	 ite 	 	 al 	 ready 	 	,	so	we	can	handle	a	few	more	.
No	,	no	reason	why	it	 re 	 ally 	 	ca	n't	happen	in	every	 class 	 room 	 	in	America	 to 	 mor 	 row 	 	.
 B 	 G 	 	:	And	the	vision	of	the	 tutor 	 ing 	 	thing	.
The	idea	there	is	,	if	I	'm	 con 	 fused 	 	about	a	 top 	 ic 	 	,	 some 	 how 	 	right	in	the	user	 inter 	 face 	 	I	'd	find	people	who	are	 volunteer 	 ing 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	see	 the 	 ir 	 	reputation	,	and	I	could	schedule	and	connect	up	with	 t 	 hose 	 	people	?
 S 	 K 	 	:	 Absolute 	 ly 	 	.	And	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	I	recommend	 every 	 one 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	audience	to	do	.
 T 	 hose 	 	 dash 	 board 	 s 	 	the	 teacher 	 s 	 	have	,	you	can	go	log	in	right	now	and	you	can	 essential 	 ly 	 	 be 	 come 	 	a	coach	for	your	 kid 	 s 	 	,	or	 nephew 	 s 	 	,	or	 cousin 	 s 	 	,	or	 may 	 be 	 	some	 kid 	 s 	 	at	the	 Boy 	 s 	 	and	 Girl 	 s 	 	Club	.
And	 yea 	 h 	 	,	you	can	start	 be 	 coming 	 	a	mentor	,	a	tutor	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	.
But	 yea 	 h 	 	,	it	's	all	there	.
 B 	 G 	 	:	Well	,	it	's	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
I	think	you	just	got	a	 glimps 	 e 	 	of	the	future	of	education	.
Thank	you	.

 Edi 	 th 	 	 Wi 	 d 	 der 	 	:	The	weird	,	 wonder 	 ful 	 	world	of	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nce 	 
So	I	want	to	take	you	on	a	trip	to	an	alien	world	.
And	it	's	not	a	trip	that	 requir 	 es 	 	 light 	 - 	 year 	 s 	 	of	travel	,	but	it	's	to	a	place	where	it	's	defined	by	light	.
So	it	's	a	 little 	 - 	 appreciate 	 d 	 	fact	that	most	of	the	 animal 	 s 	 	in	our	ocean	make	light	.
I	've	 s 	 pent 	 	most	of	my	 care 	 er 	 	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 phenomen 	 on 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nce 	 	.
I	 stud 	 y 	 	it	 be 	 cause 	 	I	think	 understand 	 ing 	 	it	is	critical	to	 understand 	 ing 	 	life	in	the	ocean	where	most	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nce 	 	 occur 	 s 	 	.
I	 al 	 so 	 	use	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	tool	for	 visual 	 izing 	 	and	 track 	 ing 	 	 poll 	 ution 	 	.
But	 most 	 ly 	 	I	'm	 en 	 trance 	 d 	 	by	it	.
Since	my	my	first	 d 	 ive 	 	in	a	 deep 	 - 	 div 	 ing 	 	submersible	,	when	I	went	down	and	 turn 	 ed 	 	out	the	 light 	 s 	 	and	saw	the	 fire 	 work 	 s 	 	 dis 	 play 	 s 	 	,	I	've	 be 	 en 	 	a	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nce 	 	 junk 	 y 	 	.
But	I	would	come	back	from	 t 	 hose 	 	 div 	 es 	 	and	try	to	share	the	experience	with	 word 	 s 	 	,	and	they	 we 	 re 	 	 total 	 ly 	 	 in 	 ad 	 equate 	 	to	the	task	.
I	 need 	 ed 	 	some	way	to	share	the	experience	 direct 	 ly 	 	.
And	the	first	time	I	 figur 	 ed 	 	out	that	way	was	in	 th 	 is 	 	little	 single 	 - 	 person 	 	submersible	 call 	 ed 	 	 De 	 ep 	 	 R 	 over 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	next	video	clip	,	you	're	going	to	see	how	we	 stimul 	 ated 	 	the	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nce 	 	.
And	the	first	thing	you	're	going	to	see	is	a	 trans 	 ect 	 	screen	that	is	about	a	meter	 a 	 cross 	 	.
 Nar 	 rator 	 	:	In	front	of	the	sub	,	a	mess	screen	will	come	 in 	 to 	 	contact	with	the	 soft 	 - 	 bodied 	 	 creature 	 s 	 	of	the	deep	sea	.
With	the	sub	's	 light 	 s 	 	 s 	 witch 	 ed 	 	off	,	it	is	possible	to	see	 the 	 ir 	 	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nce 	 	--	the	light	 produce 	 d 	 	when	they	collide	with	the	mesh	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	time	it	 ha 	 s 	 	ever	 be 	 en 	 	 record 	 ed 	 	.
 Edi 	 th 	 	 Wi 	 d 	 der 	 	:	So	I	 record 	 ed 	 	that	with	an	 intens 	 ified 	 	video	camera	that	 ha 	 s 	 	about	the	 sensitiv 	 ity 	 	of	the	fully	 dark 	 - 	 adapt 	 ed 	 	human	eye	.
 Whi 	 ch 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	is	what	you	would	see	if	you	took	a	 d 	 ive 	 	in	a	submersible	.
But	just	to	try	to	prove	that	fact	to	you	,	I	've	 br 	 ought 	 	 a 	 long 	 	some	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nt 	 	plankton	in	what	is	 un 	 doubt 	 ed 	 ly 	 	a	 fool 	 hard 	 y 	 	attempt	at	a	live	 demonst 	 ration 	 	.
So	,	if	we	could	have	the	 light 	 s 	 	down	and	have	it	 a 	 s 	 	dark	in	here	 a 	 s 	 	possible	,	I	have	a	flask	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nt 	 	plankton	in	it	.
And	you	'll	note	there	's	no	light	coming	from	them	right	now	,	either	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	dead	--	or	 be 	 cause 	 	I	need	to	stir	them	up	in	some	way	for	you	to	see	what	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nce 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
Oops	.	 So 	 rry 	 	.
I	 s 	 pend 	 	most	of	my	time	 work 	 ing 	 	in	the	dark	;	I	'm	used	to	that	.
 Oka 	 y 	 	.
So	that	light	was	made	by	a	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nt 	 	 dinofla 	 gel 	 late 	 	,	a	 single 	 - 	 cell 	 ed 	 	 al 	 ga 	 	.
So	why	would	a	 single 	 - 	 cell 	 ed 	 	 al 	 ga 	 	need	to	be	able	to	produce	light	?
Well	,	it	uses	it	to	defend	 it 	 self 	 	from	 it 	 s 	 	 predator 	 s 	 	.
The	flash	is	like	a	 s 	 cream 	 	for	help	.
It	's	what	's	known	 a 	 s 	 	a	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nt 	 	burglar	alarm	,	and	just	like	the	alarm	on	your	car	or	your	house	,	it	's	 me 	 ant 	 	to	cast	 un 	 want 	 ed 	 	attention	onto	the	 intrud 	 er 	 	,	 there 	 by 	 	either	 lead 	 ing 	 	to	his	capture	or	 scar 	 ing 	 	him	away	.
There	's	a	lot	of	 animal 	 s 	 	that	use	 th 	 is 	 	trick	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	 th 	 is 	 	black	 dragon 	 fish 	 	.
It	's	got	a	light	organ	under	 it 	 s 	 	eye	.
It	's	got	a	chin	 barb 	 el 	 	.
It	's	got	a	lot	of	other	light	 organ 	 s 	 	you	ca	n't	see	,	but	you	'll	see	in	here	in	a	minute	.
So	we	had	to	chase	 th 	 is 	 	in	the	submersible	for	 quit 	 e 	 	 some 	 time 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	top	speed	of	 th 	 is 	 	fish	is	one	knot	,	which	was	the	top	speed	of	the	submersible	.
But	it	was	worth	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	caught	it	in	a	special	capture	 de 	 vice 	 	,	 br 	 ought 	 	it	up	 in 	 to 	 	the	lab	on	the	ship	,	and	then	 every 	 thing 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	fish	 light 	 s 	 	up	.
It	's	 un 	 believ 	 able 	 	.
The	light	 organ 	 s 	 	under	the	 eye 	 s 	 	are	 flash 	 ing 	 	.
That	chin	 barb 	 el 	 	is	 flash 	 ing 	 	.
It	's	got	light	 organ 	 s 	 	on	 it 	 s 	 	 bel 	 ly 	 	that	are	 flash 	 ing 	 	,	fin	 light 	 s 	 	.
It	's	a	 s 	 cream 	 	for	help	;	it	's	 me 	 ant 	 	to	attract	attention	.
It	's	 phenomen 	 al 	 	.
And	you	 normal 	 ly 	 	do	n't	get	to	see	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	've	 exhaust 	 ed 	 	the	 luminesce 	 nce 	 	when	we	 br 	 ing 	 	them	up	in	 net 	 s 	 	.
There	's	other	ways	you	can	defend	 your 	 self 	 	with	light	.
For	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	shrimp	 re 	 lease 	 s 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nt 	 	 chemical 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	water	just	the	way	a	 s 	 quid 	 	or	an	 oct 	 opus 	 	would	 re 	 lease 	 	an	ink	cloud	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 blind 	 s 	 	or	 distract 	 s 	 	the	predator	.
 Th 	 is 	 	little	 s 	 quid 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	fire	 shoot 	 er 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 it 	 s 	 	ability	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	it	may	look	like	a	tasty	morsel	,	or	a	pig	's	head	with	 wing 	 s 	 	--	but	if	it	's	 attack 	 ed 	 	,	it	 put 	 s 	 	out	a	 bar 	 rage 	 	of	light	--	in	fact	,	a	 bar 	 rage 	 	of	 photo 	 n 	 	 torpedo 	 es 	 	.
I	just	 bare 	 ly 	 	got	the	 light 	 s 	 	out	in	time	for	you	to	be	able	to	see	 t 	 hose 	 	 gob 	 s 	 	of	light	hitting	the	 trans 	 ect 	 	screen	and	then	just	 glow 	 ing 	 	.
It	's	 phenomen 	 al 	 	.
So	there	's	a	lot	of	 animal 	 s 	 	in	the	open	ocean	--	most	of	them	that	make	light	.
And	we	have	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	idea	,	for	most	of	them	,	why	.
 The 	 y 	 	use	it	for	 find 	 ing 	 	food	,	for	 attract 	 ing 	 	 mate 	 s 	 	,	for	 defend 	 ing 	 	against	 predator 	 s 	 	.
But	when	you	get	down	to	the	bottom	of	the	ocean	,	that	's	where	 thing 	 s 	 	get	 re 	 ally 	 	strange	.
And	some	of	these	 animal 	 s 	 	are	 prob 	 ably 	 	inspiration	for	the	 thing 	 s 	 	you	saw	in	``	Avatar	,	''	but	you	do	n't	have	to	travel	to	Pandora	to	see	them	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	 gold 	 en 	 	coral	,	a	bush	.
It	 grow 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	.
In	fact	,	it	's	thought	that	some	of	these	are	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	3,000	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	which	is	one	reason	that	bottom	 trawl 	 ing 	 	should	not	be	 allow 	 ed 	 	.
The	other	reason	is	 th 	 is 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	bush	 glow 	 s 	 	.
So	if	you	brush	up	against	it	,	any	place	you	 brush 	 ed 	 	against	it	,	you	get	 th 	 is 	 	 twinkl 	 ing 	 	 blue 	 - 	 green 	 	light	that	's	just	 breath 	 taking 	 	.
And	you	see	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	 some 	 thing 	 	out	of	a	 Dr 	 . 	 	Seuss	book	--	just	all	manner	of	 creature 	 s 	 	all	over	 th 	 is 	 	thing	.
And	these	are	 fly 	 trap 	 	 ane 	 mon 	 es 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	if	you	poke	it	,	it	 pull 	 s 	 	in	 it 	 s 	 	 tent 	 acle 	 s 	 	.
But	if	you	keep	 po 	 king 	 	it	,	it	 start 	 s 	 	to	produce	light	.
And	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 end 	 s 	 	up	looking	like	a	 galax 	 y 	 	.
It	 produce 	 s 	 	these	 string 	 s 	 	of	light	,	 pre 	 sum 	 ably 	 	 a 	 s 	 	some	form	of	defense	.
There	are	 star 	 fish 	 	that	can	make	light	.
And	there	are	brittle	 star 	 s 	 	that	produce	 band 	 s 	 	of	light	that	dance	 a 	 long 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 arm 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	plant	,	but	it	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	an	animal	.
And	it	 anchor 	 s 	 	 it 	 self 	 	in	the	sand	by	 blow 	 ing 	 	up	a	balloon	on	the	end	of	 it 	 s 	 	stock	.
So	it	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	hold	 it 	 self 	 	in	 ver 	 y 	 	strong	 current 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	see	here	.
But	if	we	collect	it	 ver 	 y 	 	 gent 	 ly 	 	,	and	we	 br 	 ing 	 	it	up	 in 	 to 	 	the	lab	and	just	 squeez 	 e 	 	it	at	the	base	of	the	stock	,	it	 produce 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	light	that	 propag 	 ates 	 	from	stem	to	the	plume	,	changing	color	 a 	 s 	 	it	 go 	 es 	 	,	from	green	to	blue	.
 Color 	 ization 	 	and	sound	 effect 	 s 	 	 add 	 ed 	 	for	you	 view 	 ing 	 	pleasure	.
But	we	have	no	idea	why	it	 do 	 es 	 	that	.
 He 	 re 	 	's	 an 	 other 	 	one	.	 Th 	 is 	 	is	 al 	 so 	 	a	sea	pen	.
It	's	got	a	brittle	star	 hitch 	 ing 	 	a	ride	.
It	's	a	green	 s 	 ab 	 er 	 	of	light	.
And	like	the	one	you	just	saw	,	it	can	produce	these	 a 	 s 	 	 band 	 s 	 	of	light	.
So	if	I	 squeez 	 e 	 	the	base	,	the	 band 	 s 	 	go	from	base	to	tip	.
If	I	 squeez 	 e 	 	the	tip	,	they	go	from	tip	to	base	.
So	what	do	you	think	 happen 	 s 	 	if	you	 squeez 	 e 	 	it	in	the	middle	?
I	'd	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	your	 the 	 ories 	 	about	what	that	's	about	.
So	there	's	a	language	of	light	in	the	deep	ocean	,	and	we	're	just	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	understand	it	,	and	one	way	we	're	going	about	that	is	we	're	 imit 	 ating 	 	a	lot	of	these	 dis 	 play 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	an	optical	lure	that	I	've	used	.
We	call	it	the	 electron 	 ic 	 	 jelly 	 fish 	 	.
It	's	just	16	blue	 LED 	 s 	 	that	we	can	program	to	do	different	 type 	 s 	 	of	 dis 	 play 	 s 	 	.
And	we	view	it	with	a	camera	system	I	 develop 	 ed 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 Eye 	 - 	 in 	 - 	 the 	 - 	 Sea 	 	that	uses	far	red	light	that	's	 in 	 visible 	 	to	most	 animal 	 s 	 	,	so	it	's	 un 	 obt 	 rus 	 ive 	 	.
So	I	just	want	to	show	you	some	of	the	 respons 	 es 	 	we	've	 elicit 	 ed 	 	from	 animal 	 s 	 	in	the	deep	sea	.
So	the	camera	's	black	and	white	.
It	's	not	 high 	 - 	 re 	 solution 	 	.
And	what	you	're	 see 	 ing 	 	here	is	a	bait	box	with	a	bunch	of	--	like	the	 cock 	 roach 	 es 	 	of	the	ocean	--	there	are	 iso 	 pods 	 	all	over	it	.
And	right	in	the	front	is	the	 electron 	 ic 	 	 jelly 	 fish 	 	.
And	when	it	 start 	 s 	 	 flash 	 ing 	 	,	it	's	just	going	to	be	one	of	the	 LED 	 s 	 	that	's	 flash 	 ing 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	fast	.
But	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	it	 start 	 s 	 	to	flash	--	and	it	's	going	to	look	big	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 bloom 	 s 	 	on	the	camera	--	I	want	you	to	look	right	here	.
There	's	 some 	 thing 	 	small	there	that	 respond 	 s 	 	.
We	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	 some 	 thing 	 	.
It	 look 	 s 	 	like	a	little	of	string	 pearl 	 s 	 	 bas 	 ically 	 	--	in	fact	,	three	 string 	 s 	 	of	 pearl 	 s 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 consist 	 ent 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	was	in	the	Bahamas	at	about	2,000	feet	.
We	 bas 	 ically 	 	have	a	chat	room	going	on	here	,	 be 	 cause 	 	once	it	 get 	 s 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	,	 every 	 body 	 	's	 talk 	 ing 	 	.
And	I	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	shrimp	that	's	 re 	 leas 	 ing 	 	 it 	 s 	 	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nt 	 	 chemical 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	water	.
But	the	cool	thing	is	,	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	it	.
We	do	n't	know	what	we	're	 say 	 ing 	 	.
 Personal 	 ly 	 	,	I	think	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	sexy	.
And	then	 final 	 ly 	 	,	I	want	to	show	you	some	 respons 	 es 	 	that	we	 record 	 ed 	 	with	the	world	's	first	 deep 	 - 	 sea 	 	 web 	 cam 	 	,	which	we	had	 install 	 ed 	 	in	 Monte 	 re 	 y 	 	Canyon	last	year	.
We	've	 on 	 ly 	 	just	 beg 	 un 	 	to	 analyz 	 e 	 	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	data	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	going	to	be	a	 glow 	 ing 	 	source	first	,	which	is	like	 bio 	 luminesce 	 nt 	 	bacteria	.
And	it	is	an	optical	cue	that	there	's	 car 	 r 	 ion 	 	on	the	bottom	of	the	ocean	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	 scavenge 	 r 	 	 come 	 s 	 	in	,	which	is	a	giant	 six 	 gill 	 	 s 	 hark 	 	.
And	I	ca	n't	claim	for	 s 	 ure 	 	that	the	optical	source	 br 	 ought 	 	it	in	,	 be 	 cause 	 	there	's	bait	right	there	.
But	if	it	had	 be 	 en 	 	 follow 	 ing 	 	the	odor	plume	,	it	would	have	come	in	from	the	other	direction	.
And	it	 do 	 es 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	seem	to	be	 try 	 ing 	 	to	eat	the	 electron 	 ic 	 	 jelly 	 fish 	 	.
That	's	a	12-foot-long	giant	 six 	 gill 	 	 s 	 hark 	 	.
 Oka 	 y 	 	,	so	 th 	 is 	 	next	one	is	from	the	 web 	 cam 	 	,	and	it	's	going	to	be	 th 	 is 	 	 pin 	 wheel 	 	 dis 	 play 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	burglar	alarm	.
And	that	was	a	 Hum 	 bold 	 t 	 	 s 	 quid 	 	,	a	juvenile	 Hum 	 bold 	 t 	 	 s 	 quid 	 	,	about	three	feet	long	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	at	3,000	feet	in	 Monte 	 re 	 y 	 	Canyon	.
But	if	it	's	a	burglar	alarm	,	you	would	n't	expect	it	to	attack	the	 jelly 	 fish 	 	 direct 	 ly 	 	.
It	's	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	 attack 	 ing 	 	what	's	 attack 	 ing 	 	the	 jelly 	 fish 	 	.
But	we	did	see	a	bunch	of	 respons 	 es 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	guy	is	a	little	more	 contempl 	 ative 	 	.
``	Hey	,	wait	a	minute	.
There	's	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	 some 	 thing 	 	else	there	.	''
He	's	 think 	 ing 	 	about	it	.
But	he	's	 persist 	 ent 	 	.
He	 keep 	 s 	 	coming	back	.
And	then	he	 go 	 es 	 	away	for	a	few	 second 	 s 	 	to	think	about	it	some	more	,	and	 think 	 s 	 	,	``	 May 	 be 	 	if	I	come	in	from	a	different	angle	.	''
 No 	 pe 	 	.
So	we	are	 start 	 ing 	 	to	get	a	handle	on	 th 	 is 	 	,	but	 on 	 ly 	 	just	the	 begin 	 ning 	 s 	 	.
We	need	more	 eye 	 s 	 	on	the	process	.
So	if	any	of	you	ever	get	a	chance	to	take	a	 d 	 ive 	 	in	a	submersible	,	by	all	 mean 	 s 	 	,	climb	in	and	take	the	plunge	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	should	be	on	 every 	 body 	 	's	 buck 	 et 	 	list	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	live	on	an	ocean	planet	.
 Mo 	 re 	 	than	90	percent	,	99	percent	,	of	the	living	space	on	our	planet	is	ocean	.
It	's	a	 magic 	 al 	 	place	 fill 	 ed 	 	with	 breath 	 taking 	 	light	 show 	 s 	 	and	bizarre	and	 won 	 dr 	 ous 	 	 creature 	 s 	 	,	alien	life	 form 	 s 	 	that	you	do	n't	have	to	travel	to	 an 	 other 	 	planet	to	see	.
But	if	you	do	take	the	plunge	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	remember	to	turn	out	the	 light 	 s 	 	.
But	I	 war 	 n 	 	you	,	it	's	 addict 	 ive 	 	.
Thank	you	.

 Jon 	 a 	 than 	 	 Hai 	 d 	 t 	 	on	the	moral	 root 	 s 	 	of	 liberal 	 s 	 	and	 conserv 	 ative 	 s 	 
 Sup 	 pose 	 	that	two	American	 friend 	 s 	 	are	 travel 	 ing 	 	together	in	 It 	 a 	 ly 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	go	to	see	 Michel 	 angel 	 o 	 	's	``	 D 	 avid 	 	,	''	and	when	they	 final 	 ly 	 	come	face	to	face	with	the	statue	,	they	both	freeze	dead	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 track 	 s 	 	.
The	first	guy	--	we	'll	call	him	Adam	--	is	 trans 	 fix 	 ed 	 	by	the	 beaut 	 y 	 	of	the	perfect	human	form	.
The	second	guy	--	we	'll	call	him	Bill	--	is	 trans 	 fix 	 ed 	 	by	 embarrass 	 ment 	 	,	at	 star 	 ing 	 	at	the	thing	there	in	the	center	.
So	here	's	my	question	for	you	:	which	one	of	these	two	 guy 	 s 	 	was	more	 like 	 ly 	 	to	have	 vot 	 ed 	 	for	George	Bush	,	which	for	Al	 Go 	 re 	 	?
I	do	n't	need	a	show	of	 hand 	 s 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	all	have	the	same	 politic 	 al 	 	 stereo 	 type 	 s 	 	.
We	all	know	that	it	's	Bill	.
And	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	the	 stereo 	 type 	 	 correspond 	 s 	 	to	 re 	 ality 	 	.
It	 re 	 ally 	 	is	a	fact	that	 liberal 	 s 	 	are	much	 high 	 er 	 	than	 conserv 	 ative 	 s 	 	on	a	major	 personal 	 ity 	 	trait	 call 	 ed 	 	 open 	 ness 	 	to	experience	.
People	who	are	high	in	 open 	 ness 	 	to	experience	just	 crav 	 e 	 	 novel 	 ty 	 	,	 varie 	 ty 	 	,	 divers 	 ity 	 	,	new	 idea 	 s 	 	,	travel	.
People	low	on	it	like	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	familiar	,	that	are	safe	and	 depend 	 able 	 	.
If	you	know	about	 th 	 is 	 	trait	,	you	can	understand	a	lot	of	 puzzl 	 es 	 	about	human	behavior	.
You	can	understand	why	 artist 	 s 	 	are	so	different	from	 account 	 ants 	 	.
You	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	predict	what	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 book 	 s 	 	they	like	to	read	,	what	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 place 	 s 	 	they	like	to	travel	to	,	and	what	 kind 	 s 	 	of	food	they	like	to	eat	.
 O 	 nce 	 	you	understand	 th 	 is 	 	trait	,	you	can	understand	why	 any 	 body 	 	would	eat	at	 Apple 	 bee 	 	's	,	but	not	 any 	 body 	 	that	you	know	.
 Th 	 is 	 	trait	 al 	 so 	 	 tell 	 s 	 	us	a	lot	about	 politic 	 s 	 	.
The	main	 research 	 er 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	trait	,	 Ro 	 bert 	 	 McC 	 ra 	 e 	 	 say 	 s 	 	that	,	``	Open	 individual 	 s 	 	have	an	 affin 	 ity 	 	for	liberal	,	 progress 	 ive 	 	,	 left 	 - 	 wing 	 	 politic 	 al 	 	 view 	 s 	 	''	--	they	like	a	 socie 	 ty 	 	which	is	open	and	changing	--	``	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	closed	 individual 	 s 	 	prefer	 conserv 	 ative 	 	,	 tradition 	 al 	 	,	 right 	 - 	 wing 	 	 view 	 s 	 	.	''
 Th 	 is 	 	trait	 al 	 so 	 	 tell 	 s 	 	us	a	lot	about	the	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 group 	 s 	 	people	join	.
So	here	's	the	 de 	 script 	 ion 	 	of	a	group	I	found	on	the	Web	.
What	 kind 	 s 	 	of	people	would	join	a	global	community	 wel 	 coming 	 	people	from	every	discipline	and	culture	,	who	seek	a	 deep 	 er 	 	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	the	world	,	and	who	hope	to	turn	that	 understand 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	better	future	for	us	all	?
 Th 	 is 	 	is	from	some	guy	named	 T 	 ed 	 	.
Well	,	let	's	see	now	,	if	 open 	 ness 	 	 predict 	 s 	 	who	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	liberal	,	and	 open 	 ness 	 	 predict 	 s 	 	who	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	 TED 	 ster 	 	,	then	might	we	predict	that	most	 TED 	 sters 	 	are	liberal	?
Let	's	find	out	.
I	'm	going	to	ask	you	to	raise	your	hand	,	 whet 	 her 	 	you	are	liberal	,	left	of	center	--	on	social	 issue 	 s 	 	,	we	're	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	,	 prim 	 arily 	 	--	or	 conserv 	 ative 	 	,	and	I	'll	give	a	third	option	,	 be 	 cause 	 	I	know	there	are	a	number	of	 libertarian 	 s 	 	in	the	audience	.
So	,	right	now	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	raise	your	hand	--	down	in	the	 simul 	 cast 	 	rooms	,	too	,	let	's	let	 every 	 body 	 	see	who	's	here	--	 pleas 	 e 	 	raise	your	hand	if	you	would	say	that	you	are	liberal	or	left	of	center	.
 P 	 lease 	 	raise	your	hand	high	right	now	.	 O 	 K 	 	.
 P 	 lease 	 	raise	your	hand	if	you	'd	say	you	're	libertarian	.
 O 	 K 	 	,	about	a	--	two	dozen	.
And	 pleas 	 e 	 	raise	your	hand	if	you	'd	say	you	are	right	of	center	or	 conserv 	 ative 	 	.
One	,	two	,	three	,	four	,	five	--	about	eight	or	10	.
 O 	 K 	 	.	 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	bit	of	a	problem	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	if	our	goal	is	to	understand	the	world	,	to	seek	a	 deep 	 er 	 	 understand 	 ing 	 	of	the	world	,	our	general	lack	of	moral	 divers 	 ity 	 	here	is	going	to	make	it	 hard 	 er 	 	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	when	people	all	share	 value 	 s 	 	,	when	people	all	share	 moral 	 s 	 	,	they	 be 	 come 	 	a	team	,	and	once	you	engage	the	 psycho 	 logy 	 	of	 team 	 s 	 	,	it	 shut 	 s 	 	down	 open 	 - 	 minded 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	.
When	the	liberal	team	 lose 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	did	in	2004	,	and	 a 	 s 	 	it	 al 	 most 	 	did	in	2000	,	we	comfort	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	.
We	try	to	explain	why	half	of	America	 vot 	 ed 	 	for	the	other	team	.
We	think	they	must	be	 blind 	 ed 	 	by	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	or	by	simple	 stupid 	 ity 	 	.
So	,	if	you	think	that	half	of	America	 vote 	 s 	 	 Re 	 public 	 an 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	they	are	 blind 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	way	,	then	my	 mess 	 age 	 	to	you	is	that	you	're	trapped	in	a	moral	 m 	 atrix 	 	,	in	a	 part 	 icular 	 	moral	 m 	 atrix 	 	.
And	by	the	 m 	 atrix 	 	,	I	mean	 liter 	 ally 	 	the	 m 	 atrix 	 	,	like	the	movie	``	The	 M 	 atrix 	 	.	''
But	I	'm	here	 to 	 day 	 	to	give	you	a	choice	.
You	can	either	take	the	blue	pill	and	stick	to	your	 comfort 	 ing 	 	 delusion 	 s 	 	,	or	you	can	take	the	red	pill	,	learn	some	moral	 psycho 	 logy 	 	and	step	 out 	 side 	 	the	moral	 m 	 atrix 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	I	know	--	--	 O 	 K 	 	,	I	 assum 	 e 	 	that	 answer 	 s 	 	my	question	.
I	was	going	to	ask	you	which	one	you	 pick 	 ed 	 	,	but	no	need	.
You	're	all	high	in	 open 	 ness 	 	to	experience	,	and	 be 	 side 	 s 	 	,	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	it	might	even	taste	good	,	and	you	're	all	 epic 	 ures 	 	.
So	 any 	 way 	 	,	let	's	go	with	the	red	pill	.
Let	's	 stud 	 y 	 	some	moral	 psycho 	 logy 	 	and	see	where	it	 take 	 s 	 	us	.
Let	's	start	at	the	 begin 	 ning 	 	.
What	is	 moral 	 ity 	 	and	where	 do 	 es 	 	it	come	from	?
The	worst	idea	in	all	of	 psycho 	 logy 	 	is	the	idea	that	the	mind	is	a	blank	 s 	 late 	 	at	birth	.
 Develop 	 mental 	 	 psycho 	 logy 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 show 	 n 	 	that	 kid 	 s 	 	come	 in 	 to 	 	the	world	 al 	 ready 	 	 know 	 ing 	 	so	much	about	the	physical	and	social	 world 	 s 	 	,	and	 programm 	 ed 	 	to	make	it	 re 	 ally 	 	easy	for	them	to	learn	certain	 thing 	 s 	 	and	hard	to	learn	 other 	 s 	 	.
The	best	definition	of	 innate 	 ness 	 	I	've	ever	 s 	 een 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	just	 clar 	 ifies 	 	so	 man 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	for	me	--	is	from	the	brain	scientist	 G 	 ary 	 	 Mar 	 cus 	 	.
He	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	The	 initi 	 al 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 	of	the	brain	 do 	 es 	 	not	depend	that	much	on	experience	.
Nature	 provide 	 s 	 	a	first	draft	,	which	experience	then	 revise 	 s 	 	.
 Built 	 - 	 in 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	mean	 un 	 malle 	 able 	 	;	it	 mean 	 s 	 	 organize 	 d 	 	in	advance	of	experience	.	''
 O 	 K 	 	,	so	what	's	on	the	first	draft	of	the	moral	mind	?
To	find	out	,	my	 col 	 league 	 	,	Craig	 Jose 	 ph 	 	,	and	I	read	through	the	 liter 	 ature 	 	on	 anthropo 	 logy 	 	,	on	culture	 vari 	 ation 	 	in	 moral 	 ity 	 	and	 al 	 so 	 	on	 evolution 	 ary 	 	 psycho 	 logy 	 	,	looking	for	 match 	 es 	 	.
What	are	the	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	people	talk	about	 a 	 cross 	 	 discipline 	 s 	 	?
That	you	find	 a 	 cross 	 	 culture 	 s 	 	and	even	 a 	 cross 	 	species	?
We	found	five	--	five	best	 match 	 es 	 	,	which	we	call	the	five	 found 	 ations 	 	of	 moral 	 ity 	 	.
The	first	one	is	 harm 	 / 	 care 	 	.
We	're	all	 mammal 	 s 	 	here	,	we	all	have	a	lot	of	neural	and	hormonal	 programm 	 ing 	 	that	 make 	 s 	 	us	 re 	 ally 	 	bond	with	 other 	 s 	 	,	care	for	 other 	 s 	 	,	feel	 compass 	 ion 	 	for	 other 	 s 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	the	weak	and	 vulner 	 able 	 	.
It	 give 	 s 	 	us	 ver 	 y 	 	strong	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	about	 t 	 hose 	 	who	cause	harm	.
 Th 	 is 	 	moral	 found 	 ation 	 	 under 	 lies 	 	about	70	percent	of	the	moral	 state 	 ments 	 	I	've	heard	here	at	TED	.
The	second	 found 	 ation 	 	is	 fair 	 ness 	 / 	 reciproc 	 ity 	 	.
There	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ambigu 	 ous 	 	evidence	 a 	 s 	 	to	 whet 	 her 	 	you	find	 reciproc 	 ity 	 	in	other	 animal 	 s 	 	,	but	the	evidence	for	people	could	not	be	 clear 	 er 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 Nor 	 man 	 	 Rock 	 well 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	The	 Gold 	 en 	 	 Ru 	 le 	 	,	''	and	we	heard	about	 th 	 is 	 	from	 Kar 	 en 	 	 Arm 	 strong 	 	,	of	course	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	 found 	 ation 	 	of	so	 man 	 y 	 	 relig 	 ions 	 	.
That	second	 found 	 ation 	 	 under 	 lies 	 	the	other	30	percent	of	the	moral	 state 	 ments 	 	I	've	heard	here	at	TED	.
The	third	 found 	 ation 	 	is	 in 	 - 	 group 	 / 	 loyal 	 ty 	 	.
You	do	find	 group 	 s 	 	in	the	animal	 king 	 dom 	 	--	you	do	find	 co 	 operative 	 	 group 	 s 	 	--	but	these	 group 	 s 	 	are	 al 	 ways 	 	either	 ver 	 y 	 	small	or	they	're	all	 s 	 i 	 bling 	 s 	 	.
It	's	 on 	 ly 	 	among	 human 	 s 	 	that	you	find	 ver 	 y 	 	large	 group 	 s 	 	of	people	who	are	able	to	cooperate	,	join	together	 in 	 to 	 	 group 	 s 	 	,	but	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	 group 	 s 	 	that	are	 unit 	 ed 	 	to	fight	other	 group 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 prob 	 ably 	 	 come 	 s 	 	from	our	long	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 trib 	 al 	 	living	,	of	 trib 	 al 	 	 psycho 	 logy 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	 trib 	 al 	 	 psycho 	 logy 	 	is	so	 deep 	 ly 	 	 pleas 	 ur 	 able 	 	that	even	when	we	do	n't	have	 tribe 	 s 	 	,	we	go	 a 	 head 	 	and	make	them	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	's	 f 	 un 	 	.
 S 	 port 	 s 	 	is	to	war	 a 	 s 	 	 porn 	 ography 	 	is	to	 s 	 ex 	 	.
We	get	to	 exercis 	 e 	 	some	ancient	,	ancient	 drive 	 s 	 	.
The	fourth	 found 	 ation 	 	is	 author 	 ity 	 / 	 respect 	 	.
 He 	 re 	 	you	see	 sub 	 mis 	 s 	 ive 	 	 gest 	 ures 	 	from	two	 member 	 s 	 	of	 ver 	 y 	 	 close 	 ly 	 	related	species	.
But	 author 	 ity 	 	in	 human 	 s 	 	is	not	so	 close 	 ly 	 	based	on	power	and	 brutal 	 ity 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	is	in	other	 prim 	 ates 	 	.
It	's	based	on	more	voluntary	 de 	 ference 	 	,	and	even	 element 	 s 	 	of	love	,	at	 time 	 s 	 	.
The	fifth	 found 	 ation 	 	is	 pur 	 ity 	 / 	 sanct 	 ity 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	``	The	 All 	 e 	 gory 	 	Of	 Cha 	 st 	 ity 	 	,	''	but	 pur 	 ity 	 	's	not	just	about	 suppress 	 ing 	 	female	 sexual 	 ity 	 	.
It	's	about	any	kind	of	 ideo 	 logy 	 	,	any	kind	of	idea	that	 tell 	 s 	 	you	that	you	can	attain	virtue	by	 controll 	 ing 	 	what	you	do	with	your	body	,	by	 controll 	 ing 	 	what	you	put	 in 	 to 	 	your	body	.
And	while	the	 politic 	 al 	 	right	may	moralize	 s 	 ex 	 	much	more	,	the	 politic 	 al 	 	left	is	 re 	 ally 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	it	with	food	.
Food	is	 be 	 coming 	 	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 moralize 	 d 	 	 now 	 a 	 day 	 s 	 	,	and	a	lot	of	it	is	 idea 	 s 	 	about	 pur 	 ity 	 	,	about	what	you	're	 will 	 ing 	 	to	touch	,	or	put	 in 	 to 	 	your	body	.
I	 believ 	 e 	 	these	are	the	five	best	 candid 	 ates 	 	for	what	's	written	on	the	first	draft	of	the	moral	mind	.
I	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	we	come	with	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	a	 prepared 	 ness 	 	to	learn	all	of	these	 thing 	 s 	 	.
But	 a 	 s 	 	my	son	,	Max	,	 grow 	 s 	 	up	in	a	liberal	college	town	,	how	is	 th 	 is 	 	first	draft	going	to	get	 revise 	 d 	 	?
And	how	will	it	end	up	 be 	 ing 	 	different	from	a	kid	born	60	 mile 	 s 	 	south	of	us	in	 Lynch 	 burg 	 	,	 Virgin 	 ia 	 	?
To	think	about	culture	 vari 	 ation 	 	,	let	's	try	a	different	metaphor	.
If	there	 re 	 ally 	 	are	five	 system 	 s 	 	at	work	in	the	mind	--	five	 source 	 s 	 	of	 intuit 	 ions 	 	and	 emotion 	 s 	 	--	then	we	can	think	of	the	moral	mind	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	like	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	audio	 equal 	 izer 	 s 	 	that	 ha 	 s 	 	five	 channel 	 s 	 	,	where	you	can	set	it	to	a	different	setting	on	every	channel	.
And	my	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	,	 Br 	 ian 	 	 No 	 s 	 ek 	 	and	Jesse	 Gra 	 ham 	 	,	and	I	,	made	a	 question 	 naire 	 	,	which	we	put	up	on	the	Web	at	 www. 	 Your 	 Moral 	 s 	 .org 	 	.
And	so	far	,	30,000	people	have	taken	 th 	 is 	 	 question 	 naire 	 	,	and	you	can	too	.
 He 	 re 	 	are	the	 result 	 s 	 	.
 He 	 re 	 	are	the	 result 	 s 	 	from	about	23,000	American	 citizen 	 s 	 	.
On	the	left	,	I	've	 plot 	 ted 	 	the	 score 	 s 	 	for	 liberal 	 s 	 	;	on	the	right	,	 t 	 hose 	 	for	 conserv 	 ative 	 s 	 	;	in	the	middle	,	the	 moderate 	 s 	 	.
The	blue	line	 show 	 s 	 	you	people	's	 respons 	 es 	 	on	the	average	of	all	the	harm	 question 	 s 	 	.
So	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	see	,	people	care	about	harm	and	care	 issue 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	give	high	 endorse 	 ment 	 	of	these	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 state 	 ments 	 	all	 a 	 cross 	 	the	board	,	but	 a 	 s 	 	you	 al 	 so 	 	see	,	 liberal 	 s 	 	care	about	it	a	little	more	than	 conserv 	 ative 	 s 	 	--	the	line	 slop 	 es 	 	down	.
 Sam 	 e 	 	story	for	 fair 	 ness 	 	.
But	look	at	the	other	three	lines	.
For	 liberal 	 s 	 	,	the	 score 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	low	.
 Liberal 	 s 	 	are	 bas 	 ically 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	No	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	not	 moral 	 ity 	 	.
 In 	 - 	 group 	 	,	 author 	 ity 	 	,	 pur 	 ity 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	 ha 	 s 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	to	do	with	 moral 	 ity 	 	.	I	reject	it	.	''
But	 a 	 s 	 	people	get	more	 conserv 	 ative 	 	,	the	 value 	 s 	 	rise	.
We	can	say	that	 liberal 	 s 	 	have	a	kind	of	a	 two 	 - 	 channel 	 	,	or	 two 	 - 	 found 	 ation 	 	 moral 	 ity 	 	.
 Conserv 	 ative 	 s 	 	have	more	of	a	 five 	 - 	 found 	 ation 	 	,	or	 five 	 - 	 channel 	 	 moral 	 ity 	 	.
We	find	 th 	 is 	 	in	every	country	we	look	at	.
 He 	 re 	 	's	the	data	for	1,100	 Canadian 	 s 	 	.
I	'll	just	flip	through	a	few	other	 slide 	 s 	 	.
The	 U. 	 K. 	 	,	Australia	,	New	Zealand	,	Western	 Euro 	 pe 	 	,	 East 	 ern 	 	 Euro 	 pe 	 	,	 Lat 	 in 	 	America	,	the	Middle	East	,	East	Asia	and	South	Asia	.
 Not 	 ice 	 	 al 	 so 	 	that	on	all	of	these	 graph 	 s 	 	,	the	 slop 	 e 	 	is	 steep 	 er 	 	on	 in 	 - 	 group 	 	,	 author 	 ity 	 	,	 pur 	 ity 	 	.
 Whi 	 ch 	 	 show 	 s 	 	that	 with 	 in 	 	any	country	,	the	 disagree 	 ment 	 	is	n't	over	harm	and	 fair 	 ness 	 	.
 Every 	 body 	 	--	I	mean	,	we	debate	over	what	's	fair	--	but	 every 	 body 	 	 agree 	 s 	 	that	harm	and	 fair 	 ness 	 	matter	.
Moral	 argument 	 s 	 	 with 	 in 	 	 culture 	 s 	 	are	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	about	 issue 	 s 	 	of	 in 	 - 	 group 	 	,	 author 	 ity 	 	,	 pur 	 ity 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	effect	is	so	 ro 	 bust 	 	that	we	find	it	no	matter	how	we	ask	the	question	.
In	one	 re 	 cent 	 	 stud 	 y 	 	,	we	 ask 	 ed 	 	people	to	suppose	you	're	about	to	get	a	dog	.
You	 pick 	 ed 	 	a	 part 	 icular 	 	breed	,	you	 learn 	 ed 	 	some	new	information	about	the	breed	.
 Sup 	 pose 	 	you	learn	that	 th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	breed	is	 in 	 dependent 	 - 	 minded 	 	,	and	 relat 	 es 	 	to	 it 	 s 	 	owner	 a 	 s 	 	a	friend	and	an	equal	?
Well	,	if	you	are	a	liberal	,	you	say	,	``	Hey	,	that	's	great	!	''
 Be 	 cause 	 	 liberal 	 s 	 	like	to	say	,	``	 F 	 etch 	 	,	 pleas 	 e 	 	.	''
But	if	you	're	 conserv 	 ative 	 	,	that	's	not	so	 attract 	 ive 	 	.
If	you	're	 conserv 	 ative 	 	,	and	you	learn	that	a	dog	's	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	loyal	to	 it 	 s 	 	home	and	family	,	and	 do 	 es 	 	n't	warm	up	 quick 	 ly 	 	to	 strange 	 rs 	 	,	for	 conserv 	 ative 	 s 	 	,	well	,	 loyal 	 ty 	 	is	good	--	 dog 	 s 	 	ought	to	be	loyal	.
But	to	a	liberal	,	it	 sound 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	dog	is	running	for	the	 Re 	 public 	 an 	 	 nomi 	 nation 	 	.
So	,	you	might	say	,	 O 	 K 	 	,	there	are	these	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	between	 liberal 	 s 	 	and	 conserv 	 ative 	 s 	 	,	but	what	 make 	 s 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	three	other	 found 	 ations 	 	moral	?
 A 	 re 	 	n't	 t 	 hose 	 	just	the	 found 	 ations 	 	of	 xeno 	 phobia 	 	and	 author 	 itarianism 	 	and	 Pur 	 it 	 an 	 ism 	 	?
What	 make 	 s 	 	them	moral	?
The	answer	,	I	think	,	is	 contain 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	 trip 	 ty 	 ch 	 	from	 Hi 	 er 	 ony 	 mus 	 	 Bo 	 sch 	 	,	``	The	Garden	of	 Earth 	 ly 	 	 De 	 light 	 s 	 	.	''
In	the	first	 pan 	 el 	 	,	we	see	the	moment	of	creation	.
All	is	 order 	 ed 	 	,	all	is	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	all	the	people	and	 animal 	 s 	 	are	 do 	 ing 	 	what	they	're	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	 do 	 ing 	 	,	where	they	're	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	.
But	then	,	 give 	 n 	 	the	way	of	the	world	,	 thing 	 s 	 	change	.
We	get	every	person	 do 	 ing 	 	 what 	 ever 	 	he	 want 	 s 	 	,	with	every	aperture	of	every	other	person	and	every	other	animal	.
Some	of	you	might	 recogn 	 ize 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	'60s	.
But	the	'60s	 inevit 	 ably 	 	 give 	 s 	 	way	to	the	'70s	,	where	the	 cutting 	 s 	 	of	the	 aperture 	 s 	 	hurt	a	little	bit	more	.
Of	course	,	 Bo 	 sch 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	hell	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	 trip 	 ty 	 ch 	 	,	these	three	 pan 	 el 	 s 	 	 port 	 ray 	 	the	 time 	 less 	 	truth	that	order	 tend 	 s 	 	to	decay	.
The	truth	of	social	 ent 	 ropy 	 	.
But	 l 	 est 	 	you	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	just	some	part	of	the	 Christ 	 ian 	 	 imagin 	 ation 	 	where	 Christ 	 ians 	 	have	 th 	 is 	 	weird	problem	with	pleasure	,	here	's	the	same	story	,	the	same	 progress 	 ion 	 	,	told	in	a	paper	that	was	 publish 	 ed 	 	in	Nature	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	in	which	Ernst	 Fe 	 hr 	 	and	 Sim 	 on 	 	 G 	 ach 	 ter 	 	had	people	play	a	 common 	 s 	 	dilemma	.
A	game	in	which	you	give	people	money	,	and	then	,	on	each	round	of	the	game	,	they	can	put	money	 in 	 to 	 	a	common	pot	,	and	then	the	 experiment 	 er 	 	 double 	 s 	 	what	's	in	there	,	and	then	it	's	all	 divid 	 ed 	 	among	the	 player 	 s 	 	.
So	it	's	a	 re 	 ally 	 	nice	analog	for	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 environment 	 al 	 	 issue 	 s 	 	,	where	we	're	 ask 	 ing 	 	people	to	make	a	sacrifice	and	they	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	benefit	from	 the 	 ir 	 	own	sacrifice	.
But	you	 re 	 ally 	 	want	 every 	 body 	 	else	to	sacrifice	,	but	 every 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 tempt 	 ation 	 	to	a	free	ride	.
And	what	 happen 	 s 	 	is	that	,	at	first	,	people	start	off	 reason 	 ably 	 	 co 	 operative 	 	--	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	all	 play 	 ed 	 	 anonym 	 ously 	 	.
On	the	first	round	,	people	give	about	half	of	the	money	that	they	can	.
But	they	 quick 	 ly 	 	see	,	``	You	know	what	,	other	people	are	n't	 do 	 ing 	 	so	much	 th 	 ough 	 	.
I	do	n't	want	to	be	a	 suck 	 er 	 	.	I	'm	not	going	to	cooperate	.	''
And	so	 co 	 operation 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	 decay 	 s 	 	from	 reason 	 ably 	 	good	,	down	to	close	to	zero	.
But	then	--	and	here	's	the	trick	--	 Fe 	 hr 	 	and	 G 	 ach 	 ter 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	on	the	 seven 	 th 	 	round	,	they	told	people	,	``	You	know	what	?	New	rule	.
If	you	want	to	give	some	of	your	own	money	to	punish	people	who	are	n't	 con 	 trib 	 uting 	 	,	you	can	do	that	.	''
And	 a 	 s 	 	soon	 a 	 s 	 	people	heard	about	the	 punish 	 ment 	 	issue	going	on	,	 co 	 operation 	 	 shoot 	 s 	 	up	.
It	 shoot 	 s 	 	up	and	it	 keep 	 s 	 	going	up	.
There	's	a	lot	of	research	 show 	 ing 	 	that	to	solve	 co 	 operative 	 	 problem 	 s 	 	,	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 help 	 s 	 	.
It	's	not	 en 	 ough 	 	to	just	appeal	to	people	's	good	 motive 	 s 	 	.
It	 re 	 ally 	 	 help 	 s 	 	to	have	some	sort	of	 punish 	 ment 	 	.
Even	if	it	's	just	shame	or	 embarrass 	 ment 	 	or	gossip	,	you	need	some	sort	of	 punish 	 ment 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	people	,	when	they	're	in	large	 group 	 s 	 	,	to	cooperate	.
There	's	even	some	 re 	 cent 	 	research	 suggest 	 ing 	 	that	 relig 	 ion 	 	--	 prim 	 ing 	 	God	,	making	people	think	about	God	--	often	,	in	some	 situ 	 ations 	 	,	 lead 	 s 	 	to	more	 co 	 operative 	 	,	more	 pro 	 - 	 social 	 	behavior	.
Some	people	think	that	 relig 	 ion 	 	is	an	 adapt 	 ation 	 	 evolv 	 ed 	 	both	by	cultural	and	 bio 	 logical 	 	evolution	to	make	 group 	 s 	 	to	cohere	,	in	part	for	the	purpose	of	 trust 	 ing 	 	each	other	,	and	then	 be 	 ing 	 	more	effective	at	 com 	 pet 	 ing 	 	with	other	 group 	 s 	 	.
I	think	that	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	right	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	controversial	issue	.
But	I	'm	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	and	the	origin	of	 relig 	 ion 	 	,	and	in	what	it	 do 	 es 	 	to	us	and	for	us	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	I	think	that	the	 great 	 est 	 	wonder	in	the	world	is	not	the	Grand	Canyon	.
The	Grand	Canyon	is	 re 	 ally 	 	simple	.
It	's	just	a	lot	of	rock	,	and	then	a	lot	of	water	and	wind	,	and	a	lot	of	time	,	and	you	get	the	Grand	Canyon	.
It	's	not	that	 complic 	 ated 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	what	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 complic 	 ated 	 	,	that	there	 we 	 re 	 	people	living	in	 place 	 s 	 	like	the	Grand	Canyon	,	 co 	 oper 	 ating 	 	with	each	other	,	or	on	the	 savanna 	 h 	 s 	 	of	 Afri 	 ca 	 	,	or	on	the	 froze 	 n 	 	 shore 	 s 	 	of	Alaska	,	and	then	some	of	these	 village 	 s 	 	grew	 in 	 to 	 	the	 might 	 y 	 	cities	of	 Baby 	 lon 	 	,	and	 Rom 	 e 	 	,	and	 Ten 	 ochtitlan 	 	.
How	did	 th 	 is 	 	happen	?
 Th 	 is 	 	is	an	absolute	miracle	,	much	 hard 	 er 	 	to	explain	than	the	Grand	Canyon	.
The	answer	,	I	think	,	is	that	they	used	every	tool	in	the	 tool 	 box 	 	.
It	took	all	of	our	moral	 psycho 	 logy 	 	to	create	these	 co 	 operative 	 	 group 	 s 	 	.
Yes	,	you	do	need	to	be	 concern 	 ed 	 	about	harm	,	you	do	need	a	 psycho 	 logy 	 	of	justice	.
But	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 help 	 s 	 	to	organize	a	group	if	you	can	have	 sub 	 - 	 group 	 s 	 	,	and	if	 t 	 hose 	 	 sub 	 - 	 group 	 s 	 	have	some	internal	structure	,	and	if	you	have	some	 ideo 	 logy 	 	that	 tell 	 s 	 	people	to	suppress	 the 	 ir 	 	 car 	 n 	 ality 	 	,	to	pursue	 high 	 er 	 	,	 noble 	 r 	 	 end 	 s 	 	.
And	now	we	get	to	the	crux	of	the	 disagree 	 ment 	 	between	 liberal 	 s 	 	and	 conserv 	 ative 	 s 	 	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	 liberal 	 s 	 	reject	three	of	these	 found 	 ations 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	say	``	No	,	let	's	 celebr 	 ate 	 	 divers 	 ity 	 	,	not	common	 in 	 - 	 group 	 	 member 	 ship 	 	.	''
 The 	 y 	 	say	,	``	Let	's	question	 author 	 ity 	 	.	''
And	they	say	,	``	Keep	your	 law 	 s 	 	off	my	body	.	''
 Liberal 	 s 	 	have	 ver 	 y 	 	noble	 motive 	 s 	 	for	 do 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	.
 Tradition 	 al 	 	 author 	 ity 	 	,	 tradition 	 al 	 	 moral 	 ity 	 	can	be	 quit 	 e 	 	 repress 	 ive 	 	,	and	 restrict 	 ive 	 	to	 t 	 hose 	 	at	the	bottom	,	to	women	,	to	people	that	do	n't	fit	in	.
So	 liberal 	 s 	 	speak	for	the	weak	and	 oppress 	 ed 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	want	change	and	justice	,	even	at	the	risk	of	 cha 	 os 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	guy	's	shirt	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 S 	 top 	 	 bitch 	 ing 	 	,	start	a	revolution	.	''
If	you	're	high	in	 open 	 ness 	 	to	experience	,	revolution	is	good	,	it	's	change	,	it	's	 f 	 un 	 	.
 Conserv 	 ative 	 s 	 	,	on	the	other	hand	,	speak	for	 institution 	 s 	 	and	 tradition 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	want	order	,	even	at	some	cost	to	 t 	 hose 	 	at	the	bottom	.
The	great	 conserv 	 ative 	 	 in 	 sight 	 	is	that	order	is	 re 	 ally 	 	hard	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	.
It	's	 re 	 ally 	 	precious	,	and	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	easy	to	lose	.
So	 a 	 s 	 	Edmund	 Bur 	 ke 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	The	 restraint 	 s 	 	on	men	,	 a 	 s 	 	well	 a 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 liber 	 ties 	 	,	are	to	be	 reckon 	 ed 	 	among	 the 	 ir 	 	 right 	 s 	 	.	''
 Th 	 is 	 	was	after	the	 cha 	 os 	 	of	the	French	 R 	 evolution 	 	.
So	once	you	see	 th 	 is 	 	--	once	you	see	that	 liberal 	 s 	 	and	 conserv 	 ative 	 s 	 	both	have	 some 	 thing 	 	to	 con 	 tribute 	 	,	that	they	form	a	balance	on	change	 ver 	 s 	 us 	 	 st 	 ability 	 	--	then	I	think	the	way	is	open	to	step	 out 	 side 	 	the	moral	 m 	 atrix 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	great	 in 	 sight 	 	that	all	the	Asian	 relig 	 ions 	 	have	 attain 	 ed 	 	.
Think	about	 y 	 in 	 	and	 y 	 ang 	 	.
 Y 	 in 	 	and	 y 	 ang 	 	are	n't	 ene 	 mies 	 	.	 Y 	 in 	 	and	 y 	 ang 	 	do	n't	hate	each	other	.
 Y 	 in 	 	and	 y 	 ang 	 	are	both	 necess 	 ary 	 	,	like	night	and	day	,	for	the	 function 	 ing 	 	of	the	world	.
You	find	the	same	thing	in	 Hindu 	 ism 	 	.
There	are	 man 	 y 	 	high	 god 	 s 	 	in	 Hindu 	 ism 	 	.
Two	of	them	are	 Vis 	 hnu 	 	,	the	 preserve 	 r 	 	,	and	 Shi 	 va 	 	,	the	 destroy 	 er 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	image	 actual 	 ly 	 	is	both	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 god 	 s 	 	sharing	the	same	body	.
You	have	the	 mark 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	 Vis 	 hnu 	 	on	the	left	,	so	we	could	think	of	 Vis 	 hnu 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 conserv 	 ative 	 	god	.
You	have	the	 mark 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	 Shi 	 va 	 	on	the	right	,	 Shi 	 va 	 	's	the	liberal	god	.	And	they	work	together	.
You	find	the	same	thing	in	 Bud 	 d 	 h 	 ism 	 	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	two	 stanza 	 s 	 	contain	,	I	think	,	the	 deep 	 est 	 	 in 	 sight 	 s 	 	that	have	ever	 be 	 en 	 	 attain 	 ed 	 	 in 	 to 	 	moral	 psycho 	 logy 	 	.
From	the	Zen	master	 Seng 	 - 	 ts'an 	 	:	``	If	you	want	the	truth	to	stand	clear	before	you	,	never	be	for	or	against	.
The	struggle	between	for	and	against	is	the	mind	's	worst	disease	.	''
 N 	 ow 	 	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	it	's	a	disease	that	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	caught	by	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	world	's	 lead 	 ers 	 	.
But	before	you	feel	 super 	 ior 	 	to	George	Bush	,	before	you	throw	a	stone	,	ask	 your 	 self 	 	,	do	you	accept	 th 	 is 	 	?
Do	you	accept	 step 	 ping 	 	out	of	the	battle	of	good	and	 e 	 vil 	 	?
Can	you	be	not	for	or	against	 any 	 thing 	 	?
So	,	what	's	the	point	?	What	should	you	do	?
Well	,	if	you	take	the	 great 	 est 	 	 in 	 sight 	 s 	 	from	ancient	Asian	 philosoph 	 ies 	 	and	 relig 	 ions 	 	,	and	you	combine	them	with	the	 lat 	 est 	 	research	on	moral	 psycho 	 logy 	 	,	I	think	you	come	to	these	 con 	 clusion 	 s 	 	:	that	our	righteous	 mind 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	designed	by	evolution	to	 un 	 ite 	 	us	 in 	 to 	 	 team 	 s 	 	,	to	divide	us	against	other	 team 	 s 	 	and	then	to	blind	us	to	the	truth	.
So	what	should	you	do	?	Am	I	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	to	not	 striv 	 e 	 	?
Am	I	 tell 	 ing 	 	you	to	embrace	 Seng 	 - 	 ts'an 	 	and	stop	,	stop	with	 th 	 is 	 	struggle	of	for	and	against	?
No	,	 absolute 	 ly 	 	not	.	I	'm	not	 say 	 ing 	 	that	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	an	 amaz 	 ing 	 	group	of	people	who	are	 do 	 ing 	 	so	much	,	using	so	much	of	 the 	 ir 	 	talent	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 brilli 	 ance 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	energy	,	 the 	 ir 	 	money	,	to	make	the	world	a	better	place	,	to	fight	--	to	fight	 wrong 	 s 	 	,	to	solve	 problem 	 s 	 	.
But	 a 	 s 	 	we	 learn 	 ed 	 	from	 Sam 	 ant 	 ha 	 	Power	,	in	her	story	about	 S 	 er 	 gio 	 	 Vie 	 ira 	 	de	Mello	,	you	ca	n't	just	go	charging	in	,	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	You	're	wrong	,	and	I	'm	right	.	''
 Be 	 cause 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	just	heard	,	 every 	 body 	 	 think 	 s 	 	they	are	right	.
A	lot	of	the	 problem 	 s 	 	we	have	to	solve	are	 problem 	 s 	 	that	 requir 	 e 	 	us	to	change	other	people	.
And	if	you	want	to	change	other	people	,	a	much	better	way	to	do	it	is	to	first	understand	who	we	are	--	understand	our	moral	 psycho 	 logy 	 	,	understand	that	we	all	think	we	're	right	--	and	then	step	out	,	even	if	it	's	just	for	a	moment	,	step	out	--	check	in	with	 Seng 	 - 	 ts'an 	 	.
Step	out	of	the	moral	 m 	 atrix 	 	,	just	try	to	see	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	struggle	 play 	 ing 	 	out	,	in	which	 every 	 body 	 	 do 	 es 	 	think	they	're	right	,	and	 every 	 body 	 	,	at	 l 	 east 	 	,	 ha 	 s 	 	some	 reason 	 s 	 	--	even	if	you	disagree	with	them	--	 every 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	some	 reason 	 s 	 	for	what	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	.
Step	out	.
And	if	you	do	that	,	that	's	the	essential	move	to	 cultiv 	 ate 	 	moral	 humil 	 ity 	 	,	to	get	 your 	 self 	 	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	 self 	 - 	 righteous 	 ness 	 	,	which	is	the	normal	human	condition	.
Think	about	the	Dalai	Lama	.
Think	about	the	enormous	moral	 author 	 ity 	 	of	the	Dalai	Lama	--	and	it	 come 	 s 	 	from	his	moral	 humil 	 ity 	 	.
So	I	think	the	point	--	the	point	of	my	talk	,	and	I	think	the	point	of	TED	--	is	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	group	that	is	 passionate 	 ly 	 	 engag 	 ed 	 	in	the	 pur 	 suit 	 	of	changing	the	world	for	the	better	.
People	here	are	 passionate 	 ly 	 	 engag 	 ed 	 	in	 try 	 ing 	 	to	make	the	world	a	better	place	.
But	there	is	 al 	 so 	 	a	passionate	 commit 	 ment 	 	to	the	truth	.
And	so	I	think	that	the	answer	is	to	use	that	passionate	 commit 	 ment 	 	to	the	truth	to	try	to	turn	it	 in 	 to 	 	a	better	future	for	us	all	.
Thank	you	.

 Da 	 le 	 	 Do 	 ugherty 	 	:	We	are	makers
I	'm	going	to	have	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	simple	idea	that	I	'm	just	going	to	tell	you	over	and	over	 un 	 til 	 	I	get	you	to	 believ 	 e 	 	it	,	and	that	is	all	of	us	are	makers	.
I	 re 	 ally 	 	 believ 	 e 	 	that	.
All	of	us	are	makers	.
We	're	born	makers	.
We	have	 th 	 is 	 	ability	to	make	 thing 	 s 	 	,	to	grasp	 thing 	 s 	 	with	our	 hand 	 s 	 	.
We	use	 word 	 s 	 	like	``	grasp	''	 metaphor 	 ically 	 	to	 al 	 so 	 	think	about	 understand 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
We	do	n't	just	live	,	but	we	make	.
We	create	 thing 	 s 	 	.
Well	I	'm	going	to	show	you	a	group	of	makers	from	Maker	 Fai 	 re 	 	and	 vari 	 ous 	 	 place 	 s 	 	.
It	 do 	 es 	 	n't	come	out	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	well	,	but	that	's	a	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	tall	 bi 	 cycle 	 	.
It	's	a	 scrap 	 er 	 	bike	;	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	--	from	 Oak 	 land 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	small	 s 	 cooter 	 	for	a	 gentle 	 man 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 ize 	 	.
But	he	's	 try 	 ing 	 	to	power	it	,	or	 motor 	 ize 	 	it	,	with	a	drill	.
And	the	question	he	had	is	,	``	Can	I	do	it	?	Can	it	be	 d 	 one 	 	?	''
 Ap 	 parent 	 ly 	 	it	can	.
So	makers	are	 enthusiast 	 s 	 	;	they	're	 amateur 	 s 	 	;	they	're	people	who	love	 do 	 ing 	 	what	they	do	.
 The 	 y 	 	do	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	even	know	why	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
We	have	 beg 	 un 	 	 organ 	 izing 	 	makers	at	our	Maker	 Fai 	 re 	 	.
There	was	one	held	in	 De 	 tro 	 it 	 	here	last	summer	,	and	it	will	be	held	 aga 	 in 	 	next	summer	,	at	the	 Hen 	 ry 	 	 For 	 d 	 	.
But	we	hold	them	in	San	 Francis 	 co 	 	--	--	and	in	New	York	.
And	it	's	a	fabulous	event	to	just	meet	and	talk	to	these	people	who	make	 thing 	 s 	 	and	are	there	to	just	show	them	to	you	and	talk	about	them	and	have	a	great	conversation	.
Guy	:	I	might	get	one	of	 t 	 hose 	 	.
 Da 	 le 	 	 Do 	 ugherty 	 	:	 Th 	 ese 	 	are	electric	 muffin 	 s 	 	.
Guy	:	Where	did	you	 guy 	 s 	 	get	 t 	 hose 	 	?
 Mu 	 ff 	 in 	 	:	Will	you	glide	with	us	?
DD	:	I	know	 For 	 d 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	new	electric	 vehicle 	 s 	 	coming	out	.
We	got	there	first	.
 Lad 	 y 	 	:	Will	you	glide	with	us	?
DD	:	 Th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	I	call	``	 s 	 wing 	 ing 	 	in	the	rain	.	''
And	you	can	 bare 	 ly 	 	see	it	,	but	it	's	--	a	 controll 	 er 	 	at	top	 cycle 	 s 	 	the	water	to	fall	just	before	and	after	you	pass	through	the	bottom	of	the	arc	.
So	imagine	a	kid	:	``	Am	I	going	to	get	wet	?	Am	I	going	to	get	wet	?
No	,	I	did	n't	get	wet	.	Am	I	going	to	get	wet	?	Am	I	going	to	get	wet	?	''
That	's	the	experience	of	a	clever	ride	.
And	of	course	,	we	have	fashion	.
People	are	 re 	 making 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	fashion	.
I	do	n't	know	if	 th 	 is 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	a	 basket 	 - 	 bra 	 	,	but	it	ought	to	be	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	.
We	have	art	 student 	 s 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	together	,	taking	old	 radi 	 ator 	 	 part 	 s 	 	and	 do 	 ing 	 	an	 iron 	 - 	 pour 	 	to	make	 some 	 thing 	 	new	out	of	it	.
 The 	 y 	 	did	that	in	the	summer	,	and	it	was	 ver 	 y 	 	warm	.
 N 	 ow 	 	 th 	 is 	 	one	 take 	 s 	 	a	little	bit	of	 explain 	 ing 	 	.
You	know	what	 t 	 hose 	 	are	,	right	?
 Bil 	 ly 	 - 	 Bob 	 	,	or	 Bil 	 ly 	 	 Bas 	 s 	 	,	or	 some 	 thing 	 	like	that	.
 N 	 ow 	 	the	 back 	 ground 	 	is	--	the	guy	who	did	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	physicist	.
And	here	he	'll	explain	a	little	bit	about	what	it	 do 	 es 	 	.

So	,	are	you	a	maker	?
How	 man 	 y 	 	people	here	would	say	you	're	a	maker	,	if	you	raise	your	hand	?
That	's	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	--	but	there	's	some	of	you	out	there	that	wo	n't	admit	that	you	're	makers	.
And	 aga 	 in 	 	,	think	about	it	.
You	're	makers	of	food	;	you	're	makers	of	shelter	;	you	're	makers	of	 lot 	 s 	 	of	different	 thing 	 s 	 	,	and	 part 	 ly 	 	what	 interest 	 s 	 	me	 to 	 day 	 	is	you	're	makers	of	your	own	world	,	and	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	the	role	that	technology	 ha 	 s 	 	in	your	life	.
You	're	 re 	 ally 	 	a	driver	or	a	passenger	--	to	use	a	 Volks 	 wage 	 n 	 	phrase	.
 Maker 	 s 	 	are	in	control	.
That	's	what	 fascinate 	 s 	 	them	.	That	's	why	they	do	what	they	do	.
 The 	 y 	 	want	to	figure	out	how	 thing 	 s 	 	work	;	they	want	to	get	access	to	it	;	and	they	want	to	control	it	.
 The 	 y 	 	want	to	use	it	to	 the 	 ir 	 	own	purpose	.
 Maker 	 s 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	to	some	degree	,	are	out	on	the	edge	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	not	 main 	 stream 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	a	little	bit	radical	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	a	bit	 sub 	 ver 	 s 	 ive 	 	in	what	they	do	.
But	at	one	time	,	it	was	 fair 	 ly 	 	 common 	 place 	 	to	think	of	 your 	 self 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	maker	.
It	was	not	 some 	 thing 	 	you	'd	even	remark	 up 	 on 	 	.
And	I	found	 th 	 is 	 	old	video	.
And	I	'll	tell	you	more	about	it	,	but	just	...
 Nar 	 rator 	 	:	Of	all	 thing 	 s 	 	 American 	 s 	 	are	,	we	are	makers	.
With	our	 strength 	 s 	 	and	our	 mind 	 s 	 	and	spirit	,	we	gather	,	we	form	,	and	we	fashion	.
 Maker 	 s 	 	and	 shape 	 rs 	 	and	 put 	 - 	 it 	 - 	 together 	 ers 	 	.
DD	:	So	it	 go 	 es 	 	on	to	show	you	people	making	 thing 	 s 	 	out	of	wood	,	a	 grand 	 father 	 	making	a	ship	in	a	bottle	,	a	woman	making	a	pie	--	 some 	 what 	 	standard	fare	of	the	day	.
But	it	was	a	sense	of	 pri 	 de 	 	that	we	made	 thing 	 s 	 	,	that	the	world	around	us	was	made	by	us	.
It	did	n't	just	exist	.
We	made	it	,	and	we	 we 	 re 	 	 connect 	 ed 	 	to	it	that	way	.
And	I	think	that	's	 tremendous 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	I	'm	going	to	tell	you	one	funny	thing	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	reel	--	it	's	an	industrial	video	--	but	it	was	 show 	 n 	 	in	 drive 	 - 	 in 	 	 theater 	 s 	 	in	1961	--	in	the	 De 	 tro 	 it 	 	area	,	in	fact	--	and	it	 precede 	 d 	 	 Al 	 fr 	 ed 	 	 H 	 itch 	 cock 	 	's	``	Psycho	.	''
So	I	like	to	think	there	was	 some 	 thing 	 	going	on	there	of	the	new	generation	of	makers	coming	out	of	 th 	 is 	 	,	plus	``	Psycho	.	''
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 Andre 	 w 	 	 Arch 	 er 	 	.
I	met	 Andre 	 w 	 	at	one	of	our	community	 meet 	 ing 	 s 	 	 put 	 ting 	 	together	Maker	 Fai 	 re 	 	.
 Andre 	 w 	 	had	 move 	 d 	 	to	 De 	 tro 	 it 	 	from	Duluth	,	Minnesota	.
And	I	 talk 	 ed 	 	to	his	mom	,	and	I	 end 	 ed 	 	up	 do 	 ing 	 	a	story	on	him	for	a	magazine	 call 	 ed 	 	 Kid 	 robot 	 	.
He	's	just	a	kid	that	grew	up	 play 	 ing 	 	with	 tool 	 s 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 to 	 y 	 s 	 	.
He	 like 	 d 	 	to	take	 thing 	 s 	 	 a 	 part 	 	.
 Hi 	 s 	 	mother	 g 	 ave 	 	him	a	part	of	the	 gar 	 age 	 	,	and	he	 collect 	 ed 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	from	yard	 sale 	 s 	 	,	and	he	made	stuff	.
And	then	he	did	n't	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	like	school	that	much	,	but	he	got	 involve 	 d 	 	in	 robotic 	 s 	 	 com 	 petition 	 s 	 	,	and	he	 real 	 ized 	 	he	had	a	talent	,	and	,	more	 import 	 ant 	 ly 	 	,	he	had	a	real	 pass 	 ion 	 	for	it	.
And	he	 beg 	 an 	 	building	 robot 	 s 	 	.
And	when	I	 s 	 at 	 	down	next	to	him	,	he	was	 tell 	 ing 	 	me	about	a	company	he	 form 	 ed 	 	,	and	he	was	building	some	 robot 	 s 	 	for	 auto 	 mobile 	 	 factor 	 ies 	 	to	move	 thing 	 s 	 	around	on	the	 factor 	 y 	 	floor	.
And	that	's	why	he	 move 	 d 	 	to	 Mich 	 igan 	 	.
But	he	 al 	 so 	 	 move 	 d 	 	here	to	meet	other	people	 do 	 ing 	 	what	he	's	 do 	 ing 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 get 	 s 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	idea	 to 	 day 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	Jeff	and	 Bil 	 al 	 	and	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 other 	 s 	 	here	in	a	 hack 	 er 	 space 	 	.
And	there	's	about	three	 hack 	 er 	 space 	 s 	 	or	more	in	 De 	 tro 	 it 	 	.
And	there	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	even	some	new	 one 	 s 	 	since	I	've	 be 	 en 	 	here	last	.
But	these	are	like	 club 	 s 	 	--	they	're	sharing	 tool 	 s 	 	,	sharing	space	,	sharing	 expert 	 ise 	 	in	what	to	make	.
And	so	it	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 phenomen 	 on 	 	that	's	going	 a 	 cross 	 	the	world	.
But	 essential 	 ly 	 	these	are	people	that	are	 play 	 ing 	 	with	technology	.
Let	me	say	that	 aga 	 in 	 	:	 play 	 ing 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	do	n't	 necess 	 arily 	 	know	what	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	or	why	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	it	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	 play 	 ing 	 	to	discover	what	the	technology	can	do	,	and	 prob 	 ably 	 	to	discover	what	they	can	do	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	,	what	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 cap 	 abilities 	 	are	.
 N 	 ow 	 	the	other	thing	that	I	think	is	taking	off	,	 an 	 other 	 	reason	making	is	taking	off	 to 	 day 	 	,	is	there	's	some	great	new	 tool 	 s 	 	out	there	.
And	you	ca	n't	see	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	well	on	the	screen	,	but	Arduino	--	Arduino	is	an	 open 	 - 	 source 	 	 hard 	 ware 	 	platform	.
It	's	a	 micro 	 - 	 controll 	 er 	 	.
If	you	do	n't	know	what	 t 	 hose 	 	are	,	they	're	just	the	``	 brain 	 s 	 	.	''
So	they	're	the	 brain 	 s 	 	of	maker	 project 	 s 	 	,	and	here	's	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	one	.
And	I	do	n't	know	if	you	can	see	it	that	well	,	but	that	's	a	 mail 	 box 	 	--	so	an	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 mail 	 box 	 	and	an	Arduino	.
So	you	figure	out	how	to	program	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	you	put	 th 	 is 	 	in	your	 mail 	 box 	 	.
And	when	 some 	 one 	 	 open 	 s 	 	your	 mail 	 box 	 	,	you	get	a	 not 	 ification 	 	,	an	alert	 mess 	 age 	 	 go 	 es 	 	to	your	 i 	 Phone 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	that	could	be	a	dog	door	,	it	could	be	 some 	 one 	 	going	 some 	 where 	 	where	they	should	n't	,	like	a	little	brother	 in 	 to 	 	a	little	sister	's	room	.
There	's	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	different	 thing 	 s 	 	that	you	can	imagine	for	that	.
 N 	 ow 	 	here	's	 some 	 thing 	 	--	a	3D	 print 	 er 	 	.
That	's	 an 	 other 	 	tool	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	taken	off	--	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 re 	 ally 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 Maker 	 bot 	 	.
And	there	are	industrial	 version 	 s 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	--	about	20,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	 guy 	 s 	 	came	up	with	a	kit	version	for	750	 dollar 	 s 	 	,	and	that	 mean 	 s 	 	that	 hobby 	 ists 	 	and	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 folk 	 s 	 	can	get	a	hold	of	 th 	 is 	 	and	begin	 play 	 ing 	 	with	3D	 print 	 ers 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	they	do	n't	know	what	they	want	to	do	with	it	,	but	they	're	going	to	figure	it	out	.
 The 	 y 	 	will	 on 	 ly 	 	figure	it	out	by	 get 	 ting 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 hand 	 s 	 	on	it	and	 play 	 ing 	 	with	it	.
One	of	the	 cool 	 est 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	is	,	 Maker 	 bot 	 	 s 	 ent 	 	out	an	 up 	 grade 	 	,	some	new	brackets	for	the	box	.
Well	you	 print 	 ed 	 	out	the	brackets	and	then	 replace 	 d 	 	the	old	brackets	with	the	new	 one 	 s 	 	.
 I 	 s 	 	n't	that	cool	?
So	makers	harvest	technology	from	all	the	 place 	 s 	 	around	us	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	radar	speed	 detect 	 or 	 	that	was	 develop 	 ed 	 	from	a	 Ho 	 t 	 	 W 	 heel 	 s 	 	 to 	 y 	 	.
And	they	do	 interest 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	 re 	 ally 	 	creating	new	 area 	 s 	 	and	 expl 	 or 	 ing 	 	 area 	 s 	 	that	you	might	 on 	 ly 	 	think	--	the	 militar 	 y 	 	is	 do 	 ing 	 	 drone 	 s 	 	--	well	,	there	is	a	whole	community	of	people	building	autonomous	 air 	 plane 	 s 	 	,	or	 vehicle 	 s 	 	--	 some 	 thing 	 	that	you	could	program	to	fly	on	 it 	 s 	 	own	,	 with 	 out 	 	a	stick	or	 any 	 thing 	 	,	to	figure	out	what	path	it	's	going	.
 Fascinat 	 ing 	 	work	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	.
We	just	had	an	issue	on	space	exploration	,	 DI 	 Y 	 	space	exploration	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	best	time	in	the	 histo 	 ry 	 	of	 man 	 kind 	 	to	love	space	.
You	could	build	your	own	satellite	and	get	it	 in 	 to 	 	space	for	like	8,000	 dollar 	 s 	 	.
Think	how	much	money	and	how	 man 	 y 	 	 year 	 s 	 	it	took	 NAS 	 A 	 	to	get	 satellite 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	space	.
In	fact	,	these	 guy 	 s 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	work	for	 NAS 	 A 	 	,	and	they	're	 try 	 ing 	 	to	pioneer	using	 off 	 - 	 the 	 - 	 shelf 	 	 component 	 s 	 	,	cheap	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	n't	 special 	 ized 	 	that	they	can	combine	and	 s 	 end 	 	up	 in 	 to 	 	space	.
 Maker 	 s 	 	are	a	source	of	 innov 	 ation 	 	,	and	I	think	it	 relat 	 es 	 	back	to	 some 	 thing 	 	like	the	birth	of	the	personal	computer	industry	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 St 	 eve 	 	 Woz 	 nia 	 k 	 	.	Where	 do 	 es 	 	he	learn	about	 computer 	 s 	 	?
It	's	the	 Home 	 brew 	 	 Compu 	 ter 	 	Club	--	just	like	a	 hack 	 er 	 space 	 	.
And	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	I	could	go	there	all	day	long	and	talk	to	people	and	share	 idea 	 s 	 	for	free	.	''
Well	he	did	a	little	bit	better	than	free	.
But	it	's	 import 	 ant 	 	to	understand	that	a	lot	of	the	 origin 	 s 	 	of	our	 indu 	 s 	 tries 	 	--	even	like	 Hen 	 ry 	 	 For 	 d 	 	--	come	from	 th 	 is 	 	idea	of	 play 	 ing 	 	and	 figur 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	out	in	 group 	 s 	 	.
Well	,	if	I	have	n't	 con 	 vince 	 d 	 	you	that	you	're	a	maker	,	I	hope	I	could	 con 	 vince 	 	you	that	our	next	generation	should	be	makers	,	that	 kid 	 s 	 	are	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	ability	to	control	the	physical	world	and	be	able	to	use	 thing 	 s 	 	like	 micro 	 - 	 controll 	 ers 	 	and	build	 robot 	 s 	 	.
And	we	've	got	to	get	 th 	 is 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 school 	 s 	 	,	or	 in 	 to 	 	 commun 	 ities 	 	in	 man 	 y 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	ways	--	the	ability	to	tinker	,	to	shape	and	 re 	 shape 	 	the	world	around	us	.
There	's	a	great	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	 to 	 day 	 	--	and	that	's	what	I	 re 	 ally 	 	care	about	the	most	.
An	the	answer	to	the	question	:	what	will	America	make	?
It	's	more	makers	.
Thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.

 Virgin 	 ia 	 	 Post 	 rel 	 	on	glamour
You	might	be	 wonder 	 ing 	 	why	I	'm	 wear 	 ing 	 	 s 	 un 	 glass 	 es 	 	,	and	one	answer	to	that	is	,	 be 	 cause 	 	I	'm	here	to	talk	about	glamour	.
So	,	we	all	think	we	know	what	glamour	is	.	 He 	 re 	 	it	is	.
It	's	 glamor 	 ous 	 	movie	 star 	 s 	 	,	like	 Mar 	 lene 	 	 Diet 	 rich 	 	.
And	it	 come 	 s 	 	in	a	male	form	,	too	--	 ver 	 y 	 	 glamor 	 ous 	 	.
Not	 on 	 ly 	 	can	he	shoot	,	drive	,	drink	--	you	know	,	he	 drink 	 s 	 	wine	,	there	 actual 	 ly 	 	is	a	little	wine	in	there	--	and	of	course	,	 al 	 ways 	 	 wear 	 s 	 	a	tuxedo	.
But	I	think	that	glamour	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	much	 broad 	 er 	 	meaning	--	one	that	is	true	for	the	movie	 star 	 s 	 	and	the	 fiction 	 al 	 	 character 	 s 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	 come 	 s 	 	in	other	 form 	 s 	 	.
A	magazine	?
Well	,	it	's	 certain 	 ly 	 	not	 th 	 is 	 	one	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	 l 	 east 	 	 glamor 	 ous 	 	magazine	on	the	 news 	 stand 	 	--	it	's	all	about	 s 	 ex 	 	 tip 	 s 	 	.
 S 	 ex 	 	 tip 	 s 	 	are	not	 glamor 	 ous 	 	.
And	Drew	 Bar 	 ry 	 more 	 	,	for	all	her	 wonder 	 ful 	 	charm	,	is	not	 glamor 	 ous 	 	either	.
But	there	is	a	glamour	of	industry	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 Mar 	 gar 	 et 	 	 B 	 our 	 ke 	 - 	 White 	 	's	--	one	of	her	 picture 	 s 	 	she	did	.
 Fanta 	 s 	 tic 	 	,	 glamor 	 ous 	 	 picture 	 s 	 	of	steel	 mill 	 s 	 	and	paper	 mill 	 s 	 	and	all	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 glamor 	 ous 	 	industrial	 place 	 s 	 	.
And	there	's	the	 myth 	 ic 	 	glamour	of	the	 gar 	 age 	 	entrepreneur	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	 Hewlett 	 - 	 Pack 	 ard 	 	 gar 	 age 	 	.
We	know	 every 	 one 	 	who	 start 	 s 	 	a	business	in	a	 gar 	 age 	 	 end 	 s 	 	up	 found 	 ing 	 	 Hewlett 	 - 	 Pack 	 ard 	 	.
There	's	the	glamour	of	physics	.
What	could	be	more	 glamor 	 ous 	 	than	 understand 	 ing 	 	the	entire	 uni 	 verse 	 	,	grand	 un 	 ification 	 	?	And	,	by	the	way	,	it	 help 	 s 	 	if	you	're	 Br 	 ian 	 	 Green 	 e 	 	--	he	 ha 	 s 	 	other	 kind 	 s 	 	of	glamour	.
And	there	is	,	of	course	,	 th 	 is 	 	glamour	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 glamor 	 ous 	 	:	the	glamour	of	 out 	 er 	 	space	--	and	not	the	 alien 	 - 	 style 	 	glamour	,	but	the	nice	,	clean	,	early	'60s	version	.
So	what	do	we	mean	by	glamour	?
Well	,	one	thing	you	can	do	if	you	want	to	know	what	glamour	 mean 	 s 	 	is	you	can	look	in	the	 dict 	 ion 	 ary 	 	.
And	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 help 	 s 	 	a	lot	more	if	you	look	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	old	 dict 	 ion 	 ary 	 	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	the	1913	 dict 	 ion 	 ary 	 	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	for	centuries	,	glamour	had	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	meaning	,	and	the	word	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	used	 different 	 ly 	 	from	the	way	we	think	of	it	.
You	had	``	a	''	glamour	.
It	was	n't	glamour	 a 	 s 	 	a	quality	--	you	``	cast	a	glamour	.	''
Glamour	was	a	 liter 	 al 	 	magic	spell	.
Not	a	 metaphor 	 ical 	 	one	,	the	way	we	use	it	 to 	 day 	 	,	but	a	 liter 	 al 	 	magic	spell	 associate 	 d 	 	with	 witch 	 es 	 	and	 gy 	 psies 	 	and	to	some	 ex 	 tent 	 	,	 Cel 	 tic 	 	magic	.
And	over	the	 year 	 s 	 	,	around	the	turn	of	the	20th	century	,	it	 start 	 ed 	 	to	take	on	 th 	 is 	 	other	kind	of	 de 	 ception 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	definition	for	any	artificial	interest	in	,	or	 associ 	 ation 	 	with	,	an	object	through	which	it	 appear 	 s 	 	 d 	 elusive 	 ly 	 	 magn 	 ified 	 	or	 glor 	 ified 	 	.
But	still	,	glamour	is	an	illusion	.
Glamour	is	a	magic	spell	.
And	there	's	 some 	 thing 	 	 danger 	 ous 	 	about	glamour	 through 	 out 	 	most	of	 histo 	 ry 	 	.	When	the	 witch 	 es 	 	cast	a	magic	spell	on	you	,	it	was	not	in	your	 self 	 - 	 interest 	 	--	it	was	to	get	you	to	act	against	your	interest	.
Well	of	course	,	in	the	20th	century	,	glamour	came	to	have	 th 	 is 	 	different	meaning	 associate 	 d 	 	with	 Hol 	 ly 	 wood 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	 He 	 dy 	 	 Lama 	 rr 	 	.
 He 	 dy 	 	 Lama 	 rr 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	 Any 	 one 	 	can	look	 glamor 	 ous 	 	,	all	you	have	to	do	is	 s 	 it 	 	there	and	look	stupid	.	''
But	in	fact	,	with	all	due	respect	to	 He 	 dy 	 	--	about	whom	we	'll	hear	more	 lat 	 er 	 	--	there	's	a	lot	more	to	it	.
There	was	a	tremendous	amount	of	technical	 achiev 	 ement 	 	 associate 	 d 	 	with	creating	 th 	 is 	 	 Hol 	 ly 	 wood 	 	glamour	.
There	 we 	 re 	 	 score 	 s 	 	of	 re 	 touch 	 ers 	 	and	 light 	 ing 	 	 expert 	 s 	 	and	 make 	 - 	 up 	 	 expert 	 s 	 	.
You	can	go	to	the	museum	of	 Hol 	 ly 	 wood 	 	 histo 	 ry 	 	in	 Hol 	 ly 	 wood 	 	and	see	Max	 Fact 	 or 	 	's	special	rooms	that	he	 paint 	 ed 	 	different	 color 	 s 	 	 depend 	 ing 	 	on	the	 complex 	 ion 	 	of	the	star	he	was	going	to	make	up	.
So	you	've	got	 th 	 is 	 	 high 	 ly 	 	 styl 	 ized 	 	portrait	of	 some 	 thing 	 	that	was	not	 entire 	 ly 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	earth	--	it	was	a	portrait	of	a	star	.
And	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	we	see	 glamor 	 ized 	 	 photo 	 s 	 	of	 star 	 s 	 	all	the	time	--	they	call	them	false	color	.
Glamour	is	a	form	of	 fals 	 ification 	 	,	but	 fals 	 ification 	 	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	a	 part 	 icular 	 	purpose	.
It	may	be	to	illuminate	the	star	;	it	may	be	to	sell	a	film	.
And	it	 involve 	 s 	 	a	great	deal	of	 techni 	 que 	 	.
It	's	not	--	glamour	is	not	 some 	 thing 	 	--	you	do	n't	wake	up	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	 glamor 	 ous 	 	.	I	do	n't	care	who	you	are	.
Even	 Nico 	 le 	 	 Kid 	 man 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	wake	up	in	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	 glamor 	 ous 	 	.
There	is	a	process	of	``	 ideal 	 ization 	 	,	 glor 	 ification 	 	and	 dramat 	 ization 	 	,	''	and	it	's	not	just	the	case	for	people	.
Glamour	 do 	 es 	 	n't	have	to	be	people	.
 Architect 	 ural 	 	 photograph 	 y 	 	--	 Ju 	 li 	 us 	 	 Sch 	 ul 	 man 	 	,	who	 ha 	 s 	 	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	 trans 	 figur 	 ation 	 	,	took	 th 	 is 	 	fabulous	,	famous	picture	of	the	 Kauf 	 f 	 man 	 	House	.
 Architect 	 ural 	 	 photograph 	 y 	 	is	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 glamor 	 ous 	 	.
It	 put 	 s 	 	you	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	special	,	special	world	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 Al 	 ex 	 	Ross	's	 com 	 ic 	 	book	art	,	which	 appear 	 s 	 	to	be	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	realistic	,	 a 	 s 	 	part	of	his	style	is	he	 give 	 s 	 	you	a	kind	of	 real 	 ism 	 	in	his	 com 	 ic 	 	art	.
 Ex 	 cept 	 	that	light	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	 th 	 is 	 	way	in	the	real	world	.
When	you	stack	people	in	 row 	 s 	 	,	the	 one 	 s 	 	in	the	 back 	 ground 	 	look	 small 	 er 	 	than	the	 one 	 s 	 	in	the	 fore 	 ground 	 	--	but	not	in	the	world	of	glamour	.
What	glamour	is	all	about	--	I	took	 th 	 is 	 	from	a	 blur 	 b 	 	in	the	table	of	 content 	 s 	 	of	New	York	magazine	,	which	was	 tell 	 ing 	 	us	that	glamour	is	back	--	glamour	is	all	about	 transcend 	 ing 	 	the	 every 	 day 	 	.
And	I	think	that	that	's	 start 	 ing 	 	to	get	at	what	the	core	that	 combine 	 s 	 	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	glamour	is	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	Filippino	 Lip 	 pi 	 	's	1543	portrait	of	Saint	 Apollo 	 nia 	 	.
And	I	do	n't	know	who	she	is	either	,	but	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	[	16th	]	century	 equi 	 valent 	 	of	a	 super 	 model 	 	.
It	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 glamor 	 ous 	 	portrait	.
Why	is	it	 glamor 	 ous 	 	?
It	's	 glamor 	 ous 	 	,	first	,	 be 	 cause 	 	she	is	 beaut 	 iful 	 	--	but	that	 do 	 es 	 	not	make	you	 glamor 	 ous 	 	,	that	 on 	 ly 	 	 make 	 s 	 	you	 beaut 	 iful 	 	.
She	is	 grace 	 ful 	 	,	she	is	 myster 	 ious 	 	and	she	is	 transcend 	 ent 	 	,	and	 t 	 hose 	 	are	the	central	 qual 	 ities 	 	of	glamour	.
You	do	n't	see	her	 eye 	 s 	 	;	they	're	looking	 down 	 ward 	 	.
She	's	not	looking	away	from	you	 exact 	 ly 	 	,	but	you	have	to	 ment 	 ally 	 	imagine	her	world	.
She	's	 encourag 	 ing 	 	you	to	 contempl 	 ate 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 high 	 er 	 	world	to	which	she	 belong 	 s 	 	,	where	she	can	be	 complete 	 ly 	 	tranquil	while	 hold 	 ing 	 	the	iron	 instrument 	 s 	 	of	her	death	by	torture	.
Mel	 Gib 	 son 	 	's	``	 Pass 	 ion 	 	Of	The	Christ	''	--	not	 glamor 	 ous 	 	.
That	's	glamour	:	that	's	 Michel 	 angel 	 o 	 	's	``	 Pie 	 ta 	 	,	''	where	 Mar 	 y 	 	is	the	same	age	 a 	 s 	 	 Je 	 s 	 us 	 	and	they	're	both	 awful 	 ly 	 	happy	and	 pleas 	 ant 	 	.
Glamour	 invit 	 es 	 	us	to	live	in	a	different	world	.
It	 ha 	 s 	 	to	 simultaneous 	 ly 	 	be	 myster 	 ious 	 	,	a	little	bit	 di 	 stant 	 	--	that	's	why	,	often	in	these	glamour	 shot 	 s 	 	,	the	person	is	not	looking	at	the	audience	,	it	's	why	 s 	 un 	 glass 	 es 	 	are	 glamor 	 ous 	 	--	but	 al 	 so 	 	not	so	far	above	us	that	we	ca	n't	identify	with	the	person	.
In	some	sense	,	there	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	 some 	 thing 	 	like	us	.
So	 a 	 s 	 	I	say	,	in	religious	art	,	you	know	,	God	is	not	 glamor 	 ous 	 	.
God	can	not	be	 glamor 	 ous 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	God	is	 omni 	 potent 	 	,	 omni 	 scient 	 	--	too	far	above	us	.
And	yet	you	will	see	in	religious	art	,	 saint 	 s 	 	or	the	Virgin	 Mar 	 y 	 	will	often	be	 port 	 ray 	 ed 	 	--	not	 al 	 ways 	 	--	in	 glamor 	 ous 	 	 form 	 s 	 	.
 A 	 s 	 	I	 s 	 aid 	 	 ear 	 lier 	 	,	glamour	 do 	 es 	 	not	have	to	be	about	people	,	but	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	have	 th 	 is 	 	 transcend 	 ent 	 	quality	.
What	is	it	about	 Super 	 man 	 	?
 A 	 side 	 	from	 Al 	 ex 	 	Ross	's	style	,	which	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 glamor 	 ous 	 	,	one	thing	about	 Super 	 man 	 	is	he	 make 	 s 	 	you	 believ 	 e 	 	that	a	man	can	fly	.
Glamour	is	all	about	 transcend 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	world	and	 get 	 ting 	 	to	an	 ideal 	 ized 	 	,	perfect	place	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	reason	that	 mode 	 s 	 	of	 transport 	 ation 	 	tend	to	be	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 glamor 	 ous 	 	.
The	less	experience	we	have	with	them	,	the	more	 glamor 	 ous 	 	they	are	.
So	you	can	do	a	 glamor 	 ized 	 	picture	of	a	car	,	but	you	ca	n't	do	a	 glamor 	 ized 	 	picture	of	traffic	.
You	can	do	a	 glamor 	 ized 	 	picture	of	an	 air 	 plane 	 	,	but	not	the	 in 	 side 	 	.
The	 not 	 ion 	 	is	that	it	's	going	to	transport	you	,	and	the	story	is	not	about	,	you	know	,	the	guy	in	front	of	you	in	the	 air 	 plane 	 	,	who	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	nasty	little	kid	,	or	the	big	cough	.
The	story	is	about	where	you	're	 arriv 	 ing 	 	,	or	 think 	 ing 	 	about	where	you	're	 arriv 	 ing 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	sense	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 transport 	 ed 	 	is	one	reason	that	we	have	glamour	 styl 	 ing 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	sort	of	 stream 	 lining 	 	 styl 	 ing 	 	is	not	just	 glamor 	 ous 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	we	associate	it	with	 movie 	 s 	 	of	that	period	,	but	 be 	 cause 	 	,	in	it	's	 stream 	 lining 	 	,	it	 transport 	 s 	 	us	from	the	 every 	 day 	 	.
The	same	thing	--	 arche 	 s 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	 glamor 	 ous 	 	.
 Arch 	 es 	 	with	 stain 	 ed 	 	glass	--	even	more	 glamor 	 ous 	 	.
 Stair 	 case 	 s 	 	that	 curv 	 e 	 	away	from	you	are	 glamor 	 ous 	 	.
I	happen	to	find	that	 part 	 icular 	 	 stair 	 case 	 	picture	 ver 	 y 	 	 glamor 	 ous 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	,	to	me	,	it	 capture 	 s 	 	the	whole	promise	of	the	academic	 contempl 	 ative 	 	life	--	but	 may 	 be 	 	that	's	 be 	 cause 	 	I	went	to	 Prince 	 ton 	 	.
 Any 	 way 	 	,	 sky 	 lines 	 	are	super	 glamor 	 ous 	 	,	city	 street 	 s 	 	--	not	so	 glamor 	 ous 	 	.
You	know	,	when	you	get	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	to	 th 	 is 	 	town	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 re 	 ality 	 	.
The	horizon	,	the	open	road	,	is	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 glamor 	 ous 	 	.
There	are	few	 thing 	 s 	 	more	 glamor 	 ous 	 	than	the	horizon	--	 ex 	 cept 	 	,	possibly	,	 multi 	 ple 	 	 horizon 	 s 	 	.
Of	course	,	here	you	do	n't	feel	the	cold	,	or	the	heat	--	you	just	see	the	 possibil 	 ities 	 	.
In	order	to	pull	glamour	off	,	you	need	 th 	 is 	 	 Ren 	 aiss 	 ance 	 	quality	of	sprezzatura	,	which	is	a	term	 co 	 in 	 ed 	 	by	 Ca 	 stig 	 lion 	 e 	 	in	his	book	,	``	The	Book	Of	The	 Court 	 ier 	 	.	''
There	's	the	 not 	 - 	 glamor 	 ous 	 	version	of	what	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	 to 	 day 	 	,	after	a	few	centuries	.
And	sprezzatura	is	the	art	that	 conceal 	 s 	 	art	.
It	 make 	 s 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	look	 effort 	 less 	 	.
You	do	n't	think	about	how	 Nico 	 le 	 	 Kid 	 man 	 	is	 maneuver 	 ing 	 	that	dress	--	she	just	 look 	 s 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	natural	.
And	I	remember	 read 	 ing 	 	,	after	the	Lara	 Cro 	 ft 	 	 movie 	 s 	 	,	how	 Angel 	 ina 	 	 Jo 	 lie 	 	would	go	home	 complete 	 ly 	 	black	and	blue	.
Of	course	,	they	 cover 	 ed 	 	that	with	 make 	 - 	 up 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	Lara	 Cro 	 ft 	 	did	all	 t 	 hose 	 	same	 stunt 	 s 	 	--	but	she	 do 	 es 	 	n't	get	black	and	blue	,	 be 	 cause 	 	she	 ha 	 s 	 	sprezzatura	.
``	To	conceal	all	art	and	make	 what 	 ever 	 	is	 d 	 one 	 	or	 s 	 aid 	 	appear	to	be	 with 	 out 	 	effort	''	:	And	 th 	 is 	 	is	one	of	the	critical	 a 	 spect 	 s 	 	of	glamour	.
Glamour	is	about	 edit 	 ing 	 	.
How	do	you	create	the	sense	of	 transcend 	 ence 	 	,	the	sense	of	 evo 	 king 	 	a	perfect	world	?
The	sense	of	,	you	know	,	life	could	be	better	,	I	could	join	 th 	 is 	 	--	I	could	be	a	perfect	person	,	I	could	join	 th 	 is 	 	perfect	world	.
We	do	n't	tell	you	all	the	 grub 	 by 	 	 detail 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	 kind 	 ly 	 	lent	to	me	by	Jeff	Bezos	,	from	last	year	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 under 	 neath 	 	Jeff	's	desk	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	what	the	real	world	of	 computer 	 s 	 	,	 lamp 	 s 	 	,	 electric 	 al 	 	 appli 	 ance 	 s 	 	of	all	 kind 	 s 	 	,	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
But	if	you	look	in	a	catalog	--	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	a	catalog	of	modern	,	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 object 	 s 	 	for	your	home	--	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	.
There	are	no	 cord 	 s 	 	.
Look	next	time	you	get	these	 catalog 	 s 	 	in	your	mail	--	you	can	 usual 	 ly 	 	figure	out	where	they	hid	the	cord	.
But	there	's	 al 	 ways 	 	 th 	 is 	 	illusion	that	if	you	buy	 th 	 is 	 	lamp	,	you	will	live	in	a	world	 with 	 out 	 	 cord 	 s 	 	.
And	the	same	thing	is	true	of	,	if	you	buy	 th 	 is 	 	 lap 	 top 	 	or	you	buy	 th 	 is 	 	computer	--	and	even	in	these	 wire 	 less 	 	 era 	 s 	 	,	you	do	n't	get	to	live	in	the	world	 with 	 out 	 	 cord 	 s 	 	.
You	have	to	have	 myster 	 y 	 	and	you	have	to	have	grace	.
And	there	she	is	--	 G 	 race 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	most	 glamor 	 ous 	 	picture	,	I	think	,	ever	.
Part	of	the	thing	is	that	,	in	``	 Re 	 ar 	 	 Wind 	 ow 	 	,	''	the	question	is	,	is	she	too	 glamor 	 ous 	 	to	live	in	his	world	?
And	the	answer	is	no	,	but	of	course	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	just	a	movie	.
 He 	 re 	 	's	 He 	 dy 	 	 Lama 	 rr 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.
And	,	you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	head	 cover 	 ing 	 	is	 extrem 	 e 	 ly 	 	 glamor 	 ous 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	,	like	 s 	 un 	 glass 	 es 	 	,	it	 conceal 	 s 	 	and	 reveal 	 s 	 	at	the	same	time	.
 Tran 	 slucence 	 	is	 glamor 	 ous 	 	--	that	's	why	all	these	people	wear	 pearl 	 s 	 	.
It	's	why	 bar 	 ware 	 	is	 glamor 	 ous 	 	.	Glamour	is	 trans 	 lu 	 cent 	 	--	not	 trans 	 parent 	 	,	not	 opa 	 que 	 	.
It	 invit 	 es 	 	us	 in 	 to 	 	the	world	but	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	give	us	a	 complete 	 ly 	 	clear	picture	.
And	I	think	if	 G 	 race 	 	 Kell 	 y 	 	is	the	most	 glamor 	 ous 	 	person	,	 may 	 be 	 	a	spiral	 stair 	 case 	 	with	glass	block	may	be	the	most	 glamor 	 ous 	 	 in 	 terior 	 	shot	,	 be 	 cause 	 	a	spiral	 stair 	 case 	 	is	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	 glamor 	 ous 	 	.
It	 ha 	 s 	 	that	sense	of	going	up	and	away	,	and	yet	you	never	think	about	how	you	would	 re 	 ally 	 	trip	if	you	 we 	 re 	 	--	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	going	down	.
And	of	course	glass	block	 ha 	 s 	 	that	sense	of	 tran 	 slucence 	 	.
So	,	 th 	 is 	 	session	's	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	be	about	 pur 	 e 	 	pleasure	but	glamour	's	 re 	 ally 	 	 part 	 ly 	 	about	meaning	.
All	 individual 	 s 	 	and	all	 culture 	 s 	 	have	 ideal 	 s 	 	that	can	not	possibly	be	 real 	 ized 	 	in	 re 	 ality 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	have	 contradict 	 ions 	 	,	they	 up 	 hold 	 	 principle 	 s 	 	that	are	 in 	 commen 	 sur 	 able 	 	with	each	other	--	 what 	 ever 	 	it	is	--	and	yet	these	 ideal 	 s 	 	give	meaning	and	purpose	to	our	 live 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 culture 	 s 	 	and	 a 	 s 	 	 individual 	 s 	 	.
And	the	way	we	deal	with	that	is	we	 dis 	 place 	 	them	--	we	put	them	 in 	 to 	 	a	 gold 	 en 	 	world	,	an	 imagin 	 ed 	 	world	,	an	age	of	heroes	,	the	world	to	come	.
And	in	the	life	of	an	individual	,	we	often	associate	that	with	some	object	.
The	white	 pick 	 et 	 	 f 	 ence 	 	,	the	perfect	house	.
The	perfect	kitchen	--	no	 bill 	 s 	 	on	the	counter	in	the	perfect	kitchen	.
You	know	,	you	buy	that	 Vik 	 ing 	 	range	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	what	your	kitchen	will	look	like	.
The	perfect	love	life	--	 symbol 	 ized 	 	by	the	perfect	 neck 	 lace 	 	,	the	perfect	diamond	ring	.
The	perfect	 get 	 away 	 	in	your	perfect	car	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	an	 in 	 terior 	 	design	firm	that	is	 liter 	 ally 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	Utopia	.
The	perfect	 off 	 ice 	 	--	 aga 	 in 	 	,	no	 cord 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	far	 a 	 s 	 	I	can	tell	.
And	 certain 	 ly 	 	,	no	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	look	a	thing	like	my	 off 	 ice 	 	.
I	mean	,	there	's	no	paper	on	the	desk	.
We	want	 th 	 is 	 	 gold 	 en 	 	world	.
And	some	people	get	rich	 en 	 ough 	 	,	and	if	they	have	 the 	 ir 	 	 ideal 	 s 	 	--	in	a	sort	of	domestic	sense	,	they	get	to	 acquir 	 e 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	perfect	world	.
 De 	 an 	 	Koontz	built	 th 	 is 	 	fabulous	home	theater	,	which	is	--	I	do	n't	think	 accident 	 ally 	 	--	in	Art	 De 	 co 	 	style	.
That	 symbol 	 ize 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	sense	of	 be 	 ing 	 	safe	and	at	home	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	not	 al 	 ways 	 	good	,	 be 	 cause 	 	what	is	your	perfect	world	?
What	is	your	ideal	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	,	what	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	 edit 	 ed 	 	out	?
 I 	 s 	 	it	 some 	 thing 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	?
``	The	 M 	 atrix 	 	''	is	a	movie	that	is	all	about	glamour	.
I	could	do	a	whole	talk	on	``	The	 M 	 atrix 	 	''	and	glamour	.
It	was	 critic 	 ized 	 	for	 glamor 	 izing 	 	violence	,	 be 	 cause 	 	,	look	--	 s 	 un 	 glass 	 es 	 	and	 t 	 hose 	 	long	 coat 	 s 	 	,	and	,	of	course	,	they	could	walk	up	 wall 	 s 	 	and	do	all	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	 im 	 possible 	 	in	the	real	world	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	 Mar 	 gar 	 et 	 	 B 	 our 	 ke 	 - 	 White 	 	photo	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	from	Soviet	 Un 	 ion 	 	.	 At 	 tract 	 ive 	 	.
I	mean	,	look	how	happy	the	people	are	,	and	 good 	 - 	 looking 	 	too	.
You	know	,	we	're	 march 	 ing 	 	 to 	 ward 	 	Utopia	.
I	'm	not	a	fan	of	 P 	 ET 	 A 	 	,	but	I	think	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	great	ad	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	what	they	're	 do 	 ing 	 	is	they	're	 say 	 ing 	 	,	your	coat	's	not	so	 glamor 	 ous 	 	,	what	's	 be 	 en 	 	 edit 	 ed 	 	out	is	 some 	 thing 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
But	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	what	's	even	more	 import 	 ant 	 	than	 remember 	 ing 	 	what	's	 be 	 en 	 	 edit 	 ed 	 	out	is	 think 	 ing 	 	,	are	the	 ideal 	 s 	 	good	?
 Be 	 cause 	 	glamour	can	be	 ver 	 y 	 	 total 	 itarian 	 	and	deceptive	.
And	it	's	not	just	a	matter	of	 glamor 	 izing 	 	 clean 	 ing 	 	your	floor	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	from	``	 Tri 	 um 	 ph 	 	Of	The	Will	''	--	 brilli 	 ant 	 	 edit 	 ing 	 	to	cut	together	 thing 	 s 	 	.
There	's	a	glamour	shot	.
National	 So 	 cial 	 ism 	 	is	all	about	glamour	.
It	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	aesthetic	 ideo 	 logy 	 	.
It	was	all	about	 clean 	 ing 	 	up	 German 	 y 	 	,	and	the	West	,	and	the	world	,	and	 rid 	 d 	 ing 	 	it	of	 any 	 thing 	 	 un 	 glamor 	 ous 	 	.
So	glamour	can	be	 danger 	 ous 	 	.
I	think	glamour	 ha 	 s 	 	a	genuine	appeal	,	 ha 	 s 	 	a	genuine	value	.
I	'm	not	against	glamour	.
But	there	's	a	kind	of	wonder	in	the	stuff	that	 get 	 s 	 	 edit 	 ed 	 	away	in	the	 cord 	 s 	 	of	life	.
And	there	is	both	a	way	to	avoid	the	 danger 	 s 	 	of	glamour	and	a	way	to	 broad 	 en 	 	your	 appreci 	 ation 	 	of	it	.
And	that	's	to	take	 Isa 	 ac 	 	Mizrahi	's	 ad 	 vice 	 	and	confront	the	 manipul 	 ation 	 	of	it	all	,	and	sort	of	admit	that	 manipul 	 ation 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	enjoy	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	enjoy	how	it	 happen 	 s 	 	.
And	here	's	 He 	 dy 	 	 Lama 	 rr 	 	.
She	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 glamor 	 ous 	 	but	,	you	know	,	she	 invent 	 ed 	 	 spread 	 - 	 spectrum 	 	technology	.
So	she	's	even	more	 glamor 	 ous 	 	if	you	know	that	she	 re 	 ally 	 	was	n't	stupid	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	she	thought	she	could	look	stupid	.
 D 	 avid 	 	 Ho 	 ck 	 ney 	 	 talk 	 s 	 	about	how	the	 appreci 	 ation 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 glamor 	 ous 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 	is	 height 	 ened 	 	if	you	think	about	the	fact	that	it	 take 	 s 	 	two	 week 	 s 	 	to	paint	 th 	 is 	 	splash	,	which	 on 	 ly 	 	took	a	fraction	of	a	second	to	happen	.
There	is	a	book	out	in	the	 book 	 store 	 	--	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 Sym 	 phony 	 	In	Steel	,	''	and	it	's	about	the	stuff	that	's	 hid 	 den 	 	under	the	skin	of	the	Disney	 Cent 	 er 	 	.
And	that	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 fasci 	 nation 	 	.
It	's	not	 necess 	 arily 	 	 glamor 	 ous 	 	,	but	 unveil 	 ing 	 	the	glamour	 ha 	 s 	 	an	appeal	.
There	's	a	 wonder 	 ful 	 	book	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 Cr 	 own 	 s 	 	''	that	's	all	these	glamour	 picture 	 s 	 	of	black	women	in	 the 	 ir 	 	church	 hat 	 s 	 	.
And	there	's	a	quote	from	one	of	these	women	,	and	she	 talk 	 s 	 	about	,	``	 A 	 s 	 	a	little	girl	,	I	'd	admire	women	at	church	with	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 hat 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	 look 	 ed 	 	like	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 doll 	 s 	 	,	like	they	'd	just	 steppe 	 d 	 	out	of	a	magazine	.
But	I	 al 	 so 	 	 k 	 new 	 	how	hard	they	 work 	 ed 	 	all	week	.
 Some 	 time 	 s 	 	under	 t 	 hose 	 	 hat 	 s 	 	there	's	a	lot	of	joy	and	a	lot	of	sorrow	.	''
And	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	you	get	more	 appreci 	 ation 	 	for	glamour	when	you	 real 	 ize 	 	what	went	 in 	 to 	 	creating	it	.
Thank	you	.

 Ho 	 ward 	 	 Rh 	 e 	 ing 	 old 	 	:	The	new	power	of	 collabor 	 ation 	 
I	'm	here	to	enlist	you	in	 help 	 ing 	 	 re 	 shape 	 	the	story	about	how	 human 	 s 	 	and	other	 critter 	 s 	 	get	 thing 	 s 	 	 d 	 one 	 	.
 He 	 re 	 	is	the	old	story	--	we	've	 al 	 ready 	 	heard	a	little	bit	about	it	:	biology	is	war	in	which	 on 	 ly 	 	the	 fierce 	 st 	 	 surviv 	 e 	 	;	 business 	 es 	 	and	 nation 	 s 	 	succeed	 on 	 ly 	 	by	 defeat 	 ing 	 	,	 destroy 	 ing 	 	and	 domin 	 ating 	 	 com 	 petition 	 	;	 politic 	 s 	 	is	about	your	side	winning	at	all	 cost 	 s 	 	.
But	I	think	we	can	see	the	 ver 	 y 	 	 begin 	 ning 	 s 	 	of	a	new	story	 begin 	 ning 	 	to	emerge	.
It	's	a	narrative	spread	 a 	 cross 	 	a	number	of	different	 discipline 	 s 	 	,	in	which	 co 	 operation 	 	,	 collect 	 ive 	 	action	and	complex	 inter 	 depend 	 encies 	 	play	a	more	 import 	 ant 	 	role	.
And	the	central	,	but	not	 all 	 - 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	role	of	 com 	 petition 	 	and	 surviv 	 al 	 	of	the	 fit 	 test 	 	 shrink 	 s 	 	just	a	little	bit	to	make	room	.
I	 start 	 ed 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	the	relationship	between	communication	,	media	and	 collect 	 ive 	 	action	when	I	wrote	``	Smart	 Mo 	 b 	 s 	 	,	''	and	I	found	that	when	I	 finish 	 ed 	 	the	book	,	I	 ke 	 pt 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	it	.
In	fact	,	if	you	look	back	,	human	communication	media	and	the	ways	in	which	we	organize	 social 	 ly 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	 co 	 - 	 evolv 	 ing 	 	for	 quit 	 e 	 	a	long	time	.
 Human 	 s 	 	have	lived	for	much	,	much	 long 	 er 	 	than	the	 approximate 	 ly 	 	10,000	 year 	 s 	 	of	 settl 	 ed 	 	 agricultur 	 al 	 	 civil 	 ization 	 	in	small	family	 group 	 s 	 	.	 No 	 mad 	 ic 	 	 hunter 	 s 	 	 br 	 ing 	 	down	 rabbi 	 ts 	 	,	 gather 	 ing 	 	food	.
The	form	of	wealth	in	 t 	 hose 	 	 day 	 s 	 	was	 en 	 ough 	 	food	to	stay	 al 	 ive 	 	.
But	at	some	point	,	they	 band 	 ed 	 	together	to	hunt	 big 	 ger 	 	game	.
And	we	do	n't	know	 exact 	 ly 	 	how	they	did	 th 	 is 	 	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	they	must	have	 solve 	 d 	 	some	 collect 	 ive 	 	action	 problem 	 s 	 	;	it	 on 	 ly 	 	 make 	 s 	 	sense	that	you	ca	n't	hunt	 mast 	 odon 	 s 	 	while	you	're	 fight 	 ing 	 	with	the	other	 group 	 s 	 	.
And	 aga 	 in 	 	,	we	have	no	way	of	 know 	 ing 	 	,	but	it	's	clear	that	a	new	form	of	wealth	must	have	 emerge 	 d 	 	.
 Mo 	 re 	 	protein	than	a	hunter	's	family	could	eat	before	it	 rot 	 ted 	 	.
So	that	raised	a	social	question	that	I	 believ 	 e 	 	must	have	driven	new	social	 form 	 s 	 	.
Did	the	people	who	ate	that	 mast 	 odon 	 	meat	owe	 some 	 thing 	 	to	the	 hunter 	 s 	 	and	 the 	 ir 	 	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	?
And	if	so	,	how	did	they	make	 arrange 	 ments 	 	?
 Aga 	 in 	 	,	we	ca	n't	know	,	but	we	can	be	 pre 	 tty 	 	 s 	 ure 	 	that	some	form	of	 symbol 	 ic 	 	communication	must	have	 be 	 en 	 	 involve 	 d 	 	.
Of	course	,	with	 agricultur 	 e 	 	came	the	first	big	 civil 	 ization 	 s 	 	,	the	first	cities	built	of	mud	and	brick	,	the	first	 empire 	 s 	 	.
And	it	was	the	 administer 	 s 	 	of	these	 empire 	 s 	 	who	 beg 	 an 	 	 hir 	 ing 	 	people	to	keep	track	of	the	wheat	and	sheep	and	wine	that	was	 ow 	 ed 	 	and	the	 tax 	 es 	 	that	was	 ow 	 ed 	 	on	them	by	making	 mark 	 s 	 	;	 mark 	 s 	 	on	clay	in	that	time	.
Not	too	much	 long 	 er 	 	after	that	,	the	 alpha 	 bet 	 	was	 invent 	 ed 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	 power 	 ful 	 	tool	was	 re 	 ally 	 	 re 	 serv 	 ed 	 	,	for	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 year 	 s 	 	,	for	the	elite	 administr 	 ators 	 	who	 ke 	 pt 	 	track	of	 account 	 s 	 	for	the	 empire 	 s 	 	.
And	then	 an 	 other 	 	communication	technology	enabled	new	media	:	the	 print 	 ing 	 	press	came	 a 	 long 	 	,	and	 with 	 in 	 	 decade 	 s 	 	,	 million 	 s 	 	of	people	 be 	 came 	 	 liter 	 ate 	 	.
And	from	 liter 	 ate 	 	 population 	 s 	 	,	new	 form 	 s 	 	of	 collect 	 ive 	 	action	 emerge 	 d 	 	in	the	 sphere 	 s 	 	of	knowledge	,	 relig 	 ion 	 	and	 politic 	 s 	 	.
We	saw	scientific	 revolution 	 s 	 	,	the	 Protest 	 ant 	 	 Re 	 form 	 ation 	 	,	 constit 	 ution 	 al 	 	 demo 	 cracies 	 	possible	where	they	had	not	 be 	 en 	 	possible	before	.
Not	 create 	 d 	 	by	the	 print 	 ing 	 	press	,	but	enabled	by	the	 collect 	 ive 	 	action	that	 emerge 	 s 	 	from	 liter 	 acy 	 	.
And	 aga 	 in 	 	,	new	 form 	 s 	 	of	wealth	 emerge 	 d 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	commerce	is	ancient	.	 Market 	 s 	 	are	 a 	 s 	 	old	 a 	 s 	 	the	 cross 	 road 	 s 	 	.
But	 capital 	 ism 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	know	it	,	is	 on 	 ly 	 	a	few	hundred	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	enabled	by	 co 	 operative 	 	 arrange 	 ments 	 	and	 techno 	 logies 	 	,	 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	 joint 	 - 	 stock 	 	 owner 	 ship 	 	company	,	 share 	 d 	 	 li 	 ability 	 	 insur 	 ance 	 	,	 double 	 - 	 entry 	 	 book 	 keep 	 ing 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	of	course	,	the	 enabl 	 ing 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	are	based	on	the	Internet	,	and	in	the	 man 	 y 	 - 	 to 	 - 	 man 	 y 	 	era	,	every	 desk 	 top 	 	is	now	a	 print 	 ing 	 	press	,	a	 broad 	 cast 	 ing 	 	station	,	a	community	or	a	 market 	 place 	 	.
Evolution	is	 speed 	 ing 	 	up	.
 Mo 	 re 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	that	power	is	 un 	 tether 	 ing 	 	and	 leap 	 ing 	 	off	the	 desk 	 top 	 s 	 	,	and	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	we	're	going	to	see	a	significant	proportion	,	if	not	the	 major 	 ity 	 	of	the	human	race	,	 walk 	 ing 	 	around	 hold 	 ing 	 	,	 carry 	 ing 	 	or	 wear 	 ing 	 	 super 	 computer 	 s 	 	linked	at	 speed 	 s 	 	 great 	 er 	 	than	what	we	consider	to	be	 broad 	 band 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	when	I	 start 	 ed 	 	looking	 in 	 to 	 	 collect 	 ive 	 	action	,	the	 consider 	 able 	 	 liter 	 ature 	 	on	it	is	based	on	what	 socio 	 logists 	 	call	``	social	 dilemma 	 s 	 	.	''
And	there	are	a	couple	of	 myth 	 ic 	 	 narrative 	 s 	 	of	social	 dilemma 	 s 	 	.
I	'm	going	to	talk	 brief 	 ly 	 	about	two	of	them	:	the	prisoner	's	dilemma	and	the	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	of	the	 common 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	when	I	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	with	 K 	 e 	 vin 	 	 Kell 	 y 	 	,	he	 assur 	 ed 	 	me	that	 every 	 body 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	audience	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	 know 	 s 	 	the	 detail 	 s 	 	of	the	prisoner	's	dilemma	,	so	I	'm	just	going	to	go	over	that	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
If	you	have	more	 question 	 s 	 	about	it	,	ask	 K 	 e 	 vin 	 	 Kell 	 y 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	.
The	prisoner	's	dilemma	is	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	story	that	's	 over 	 laid 	 	on	a	 mathematic 	 al 	 	 m 	 atrix 	 	that	came	out	of	the	game	 theor 	 y 	 	in	the	early	 year 	 s 	 	of	 think 	 ing 	 	about	nuclear	war	:	two	 player 	 s 	 	who	could	n't	trust	each	other	.
Let	me	just	say	that	every	 un 	 secure 	 d 	 	 trans 	 action 	 	is	a	good	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	a	prisoner	's	dilemma	.
 Per 	 son 	 	with	the	 good 	 s 	 	,	person	with	the	money	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	ca	n't	trust	each	other	,	are	not	going	to	 ex 	 change 	 	.
 N 	 either 	 	one	 want 	 s 	 	to	be	the	first	one	or	they	're	going	to	get	the	 suck 	 er 	 	's	 pay 	 off 	 	,	but	both	lose	,	of	course	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	do	n't	get	what	they	want	.
If	they	could	 on 	 ly 	 	agree	,	if	they	could	 on 	 ly 	 	turn	a	prisoner	's	dilemma	 in 	 to 	 	a	different	 pay 	 off 	 	 m 	 atrix 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	an	assurance	game	,	they	could	proceed	.
Twenty	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	 Ro 	 bert 	 	 Ax 	 el 	 rod 	 	used	the	prisoner	's	dilemma	 a 	 s 	 	a	 prob 	 e 	 	of	the	 bio 	 logical 	 	question	:	if	we	are	here	 be 	 cause 	 	our	 ance 	 s 	 tors 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 s 	 uch 	 	fierce	 competitor 	 s 	 	,	how	 do 	 es 	 	 co 	 operation 	 	exist	at	all	?
He	 start 	 ed 	 	a	computer	tournament	for	people	to	submit	prisoner	's	dilemma	 strat 	 egi 	 es 	 	and	 discover 	 ed 	 	,	much	to	his	surprise	,	that	a	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	won	--	it	won	the	first	tournament	,	and	even	after	 every 	 one 	 	 k 	 new 	 	it	won	,	it	won	the	second	tournament	--	that	's	known	 a 	 s 	 	tit	for	tat	.
 An 	 other 	 	economic	game	that	may	not	be	 a 	 s 	 	well	known	 a 	 s 	 	the	prisoner	's	dilemma	is	the	ultimatum	game	,	and	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	 prob 	 e 	 	of	our	 assumption 	 s 	 	about	the	way	people	make	economic	 trans 	 action 	 s 	 	.
 He 	 re 	 	's	how	the	game	is	 play 	 ed 	 	:	there	are	two	 player 	 s 	 	;	they	've	never	 play 	 ed 	 	the	game	before	,	they	will	not	play	the	game	 aga 	 in 	 	,	they	do	n't	know	each	other	,	and	they	are	,	in	fact	,	in	 separat 	 e 	 	rooms	.
First	player	is	 off 	 er 	 ed 	 	a	hundred	 dollar 	 s 	 	and	is	 ask 	 ed 	 	to	 pro 	 pose 	 	a	split	:	50/50	,	90/10	,	 what 	 ever 	 	that	player	 want 	 s 	 	to	 pro 	 pose 	 	.	The	second	player	either	 accept 	 s 	 	the	split	--	both	 player 	 s 	 	are	paid	and	the	game	is	over	--	or	 reject 	 s 	 	the	split	--	 n 	 either 	 	player	is	paid	and	the	game	is	over	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	the	fundamental	 bas 	 is 	 	of	 neo 	 classic 	 al 	 	 economic 	 s 	 	would	tell	you	it	's	irrational	to	reject	a	dollar	 be 	 cause 	 	 some 	 one 	 	you	do	n't	know	in	 an 	 other 	 	room	is	going	to	get	99	.
 Y 	 et 	 	in	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 trial 	 s 	 	with	American	and	European	and	 Japan 	 ese 	 	 student 	 s 	 	,	a	significant	 percent 	 age 	 	would	reject	any	 off 	 er 	 	that	's	not	close	to	50/50	.
And	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	 screen 	 ed 	 	and	did	n't	know	about	the	game	and	had	never	 play 	 ed 	 	the	game	before	,	 prop 	 os 	 ers 	 	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	 innate 	 ly 	 	know	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	the	average	proposal	was	 surprising 	 ly 	 	close	to	50/50	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	the	 interest 	 ing 	 	part	 come 	 s 	 	in	more	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	when	 anthropo 	 logists 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	taking	 th 	 is 	 	game	to	other	 culture 	 s 	 	and	 discover 	 ed 	 	,	to	 the 	 ir 	 	surprise	,	that	 s 	 lash 	 - 	 and 	 - 	 burn 	 	 agricultur 	 alist 	 s 	 	in	the	Amazon	or	 nomad 	 ic 	 	 pastor 	 alist 	 s 	 	in	 Cent 	 ral 	 	Asia	or	a	dozen	different	 culture 	 s 	 	--	each	had	 radical 	 ly 	 	different	 idea 	 s 	 	of	what	is	fair	.
 Whi 	 ch 	 	 suggest 	 s 	 	that	 in 	 stead 	 	of	there	 be 	 ing 	 	an	innate	sense	of	 fair 	 ness 	 	,	that	 some 	 how 	 	the	 bas 	 is 	 	of	our	economic	 trans 	 action 	 s 	 	can	be	 influence 	 d 	 	by	our	social	 institution 	 s 	 	,	 whet 	 her 	 	we	know	that	or	not	.
The	other	major	narrative	of	social	 dilemma 	 s 	 	is	the	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	of	the	 common 	 s 	 	.
 Gar 	 ret 	 t 	 	 Hard 	 in 	 	used	it	to	talk	about	 over 	 population 	 	in	the	late	1960s	.
He	used	the	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	a	common	grazing	area	in	which	each	person	by	 simpl 	 y 	 	 maxim 	 izing 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	own	flock	led	to	 over 	 grazing 	 	and	the	 deple 	 tion 	 	of	the	resource	.
He	had	the	 ra 	 ther 	 	 gloom 	 y 	 	 con 	 clusion 	 	that	 human 	 s 	 	will	 inevit 	 ably 	 	 de 	 spoil 	 	any	common	pool	resource	in	which	people	can	not	be	 re 	 s 	 trained 	 	from	using	it	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	 Eli 	 nor 	 	 O 	 s 	 trom 	 	,	a	 politic 	 al 	 	scientist	,	in	1990	 ask 	 ed 	 	the	 interest 	 ing 	 	question	that	any	good	scientist	should	ask	,	which	is	:	is	it	 re 	 ally 	 	true	that	 human 	 s 	 	will	 al 	 ways 	 	 de 	 spoil 	 	 common 	 s 	 	?
So	she	went	out	and	 look 	 ed 	 	at	what	data	she	could	find	.
She	 look 	 ed 	 	at	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 case 	 s 	 	of	 human 	 s 	 	sharing	 water 	 shed 	 s 	 	,	 forest 	 ry 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	,	 fish 	 eries 	 	,	and	 discover 	 ed 	 	that	 y 	 es 	 	,	in	case	after	case	,	 human 	 s 	 	 destroy 	 ed 	 	the	 common 	 s 	 	that	they	 depend 	 ed 	 	on	.
But	she	 al 	 so 	 	found	 man 	 y 	 	 in 	 stance 	 s 	 	in	which	people	 es 	 cap 	 ed 	 	the	prisoner	's	dilemma	;	in	fact	,	the	 tra 	 ged 	 y 	 	of	the	 common 	 s 	 	is	a	 multi 	 player 	 	prisoner	's	dilemma	.

 Ver 	 y 	 	 brief 	 ly 	 	,	let	's	look	at	some	 business 	 es 	 	.

 Re 	 becca 	 	 S 	 axe 	 	:	How	we	read	each	other	's	 mind 	 s 	 
 To 	 day 	 	I	'm	going	to	talk	to	you	about	the	problem	of	other	 mind 	 s 	 	.
And	the	problem	I	'm	going	to	talk	about	is	not	the	familiar	one	from	 philosoph 	 y 	 	,	which	is	,	``	How	can	we	know	 whet 	 her 	 	other	people	have	 mind 	 s 	 	?	''
That	is	,	 may 	 be 	 	you	have	a	mind	,	and	 every 	 one 	 	else	is	just	a	 re 	 ally 	 	convincing	robot	.
So	that	's	a	problem	in	 philosoph 	 y 	 	,	but	for	 to 	 day 	 	's	 purpose 	 s 	 	I	'm	going	to	 assum 	 e 	 	that	 man 	 y 	 	people	in	 th 	 is 	 	audience	have	a	mind	,	and	that	I	do	n't	have	to	worry	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
There	is	a	second	problem	that	is	 may 	 be 	 	even	more	familiar	to	us	 a 	 s 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	and	 teacher 	 s 	 	and	 spouse 	 s 	 	and	 novel 	 ists 	 	,	which	is	,	``	Why	is	it	so	hard	to	know	what	 some 	 body 	 	else	 want 	 s 	 	or	 believ 	 es 	 	?	''
Or	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	,	more	 relevant 	 ly 	 	,	``	Why	is	it	so	hard	to	change	what	 some 	 body 	 	else	 want 	 s 	 	or	 believ 	 es 	 	?	''
I	think	 novel 	 ists 	 	put	 th 	 is 	 	best	.
Like	Philip	Roth	,	who	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	And	yet	,	what	are	we	to	do	about	 th 	 is 	 	 terr 	 ibly 	 	significant	business	of	other	people	?
So	ill	 equi 	 pped 	 	are	we	all	,	to	envision	one	 an 	 other 	 	's	 in 	 terior 	 	 work 	 ing 	 s 	 	and	 in 	 visible 	 	 aim 	 s 	 	.	''
So	 a 	 s 	 	a	teacher	and	 a 	 s 	 	a	spouse	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	of	course	,	a	problem	I	confront	every	day	.
But	 a 	 s 	 	a	scientist	,	I	'm	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	a	different	problem	of	other	 mind 	 s 	 	,	and	that	is	the	one	I	'm	going	to	 introduc 	 e 	 	to	you	 to 	 day 	 	.
And	that	problem	is	,	``	How	is	it	so	easy	to	know	other	 mind 	 s 	 	?	''
So	to	start	with	an	 illustr 	 ation 	 	,	you	need	 al 	 most 	 	no	information	,	one	 snap 	 shot 	 	of	a	 strange 	 r 	 	,	to	guess	what	 th 	 is 	 	woman	is	 think 	 ing 	 	,	or	what	 th 	 is 	 	man	is	.
And	put	 an 	 other 	 	way	,	the	crux	of	the	problem	is	the	machine	that	we	use	for	 think 	 ing 	 	about	other	 mind 	 s 	 	,	our	brain	,	is	made	up	of	 piece 	 s 	 	,	brain	 cell 	 s 	 	,	that	we	share	with	all	other	 animal 	 s 	 	,	with	 monkey 	 s 	 	and	 mic 	 e 	 	and	even	sea	 slug 	 s 	 	.
And	yet	,	you	put	them	together	in	a	 part 	 icular 	 	network	,	and	what	you	get	is	the	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	write	 Rom 	 eo 	 	and	 Ju 	 lie 	 t 	 	.
Or	to	say	,	 a 	 s 	 	 Al 	 an 	 	 Green 	 span 	 	did	,	``	I	know	you	think	you	understand	what	you	thought	I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	but	I	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	you	 real 	 ize 	 	that	what	you	heard	is	not	what	I	 me 	 ant 	 	.	''
So	,	the	job	of	my	field	of	cognitive	 neuro 	 science 	 	is	to	stand	with	these	 idea 	 s 	 	,	one	in	each	hand	.
And	to	try	to	understand	how	you	can	put	together	simple	 unit 	 s 	 	,	simple	 mess 	 age 	 s 	 	over	space	and	time	,	in	a	network	,	and	get	 th 	 is 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	human	 cap 	 a 	 city 	 	to	think	about	 mind 	 s 	 	.
So	I	'm	going	to	tell	you	three	 thing 	 s 	 	about	 th 	 is 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
 Obvious 	 ly 	 	the	whole	project	here	is	huge	.
And	I	'm	going	to	tell	you	just	our	first	few	 step 	 s 	 	about	the	 discover 	 y 	 	of	a	special	brain	region	for	 think 	 ing 	 	about	other	people	's	 thought 	 s 	 	.
Some	 observ 	 ations 	 	on	the	 s 	 low 	 	 develop 	 ment 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	system	 a 	 s 	 	we	learn	how	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	difficult	job	.
And	then	 final 	 ly 	 	,	to	show	that	some	of	the	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	between	people	,	in	how	we	 judg 	 e 	 	 other 	 s 	 	,	can	be	 explain 	 ed 	 	by	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	brain	system	.
So	first	,	the	first	thing	I	want	to	tell	you	is	that	there	is	a	brain	region	in	the	human	brain	,	in	your	 brain 	 s 	 	,	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	job	it	is	to	think	about	other	people	's	 thought 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	of	it	.
It	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	Right	 Tem 	 poro 	 - 	 Par 	 ietal 	 	 J 	 un 	 ction 	 	.
It	's	above	and	 be 	 hind 	 	your	right	ear	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	brain	region	you	used	when	you	saw	the	 picture 	 s 	 	I	 show 	 ed 	 	you	,	or	when	you	read	 Rom 	 eo 	 	and	 Ju 	 lie 	 t 	 	or	when	you	 tri 	 ed 	 	to	understand	 Al 	 an 	 	 Green 	 span 	 	.
And	you	do	n't	use	it	for	solving	any	other	 kind 	 s 	 	of	logical	 problem 	 s 	 	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	brain	region	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	Right	TPJ	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	picture	 show 	 s 	 	the	average	 activ 	 ation 	 	in	a	group	of	what	we	call	typical	human	 adult 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	 MI 	 T 	 	 under 	 graduate 	 s 	 	.
The	second	thing	I	want	to	say	about	 th 	 is 	 	brain	system	is	that	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	we	human	 adult 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	good	at	 understand 	 ing 	 	other	 mind 	 s 	 	,	we	 we 	 re 	 	n't	 al 	 ways 	 	that	way	.
It	 take 	 s 	 	children	a	long	time	to	break	 in 	 to 	 	the	system	.
I	'm	going	to	show	you	a	little	bit	of	that	long	,	 extend 	 ed 	 	process	.
The	first	thing	I	'm	going	to	show	you	is	a	change	between	age	three	and	five	,	 a 	 s 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	learn	to	understand	that	 some 	 body 	 	else	can	have	 belief 	 s 	 	that	are	different	from	 the 	 ir 	 	own	.
So	I	'm	going	to	show	you	a	 five 	 - 	 year 	 - 	 old 	 	who	is	 get 	 ting 	 	a	standard	kind	of	 puzzl 	 e 	 	that	we	call	the	false	belief	task	.
 Re 	 becca 	 	 S 	 axe 	 	:	 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	first	pirate	.	 Hi 	 s 	 	name	is	 I 	 van 	 	.
And	you	know	what	 pirate 	 s 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	like	?
Child	:	What	?	RS	:	 Pi 	 rates 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	like	cheese	 sandwich 	 es 	 	.
Child	:	 Che 	 ese 	 	?	I	love	cheese	!
RS	:	Yeah	.	So	 I 	 van 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	cheese	sandwich	,	and	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 Y 	 um 	 	 y 	 um 	 	 y 	 um 	 	 y 	 um 	 	 y 	 um 	 	!
I	 re 	 ally 	 	love	cheese	 sandwich 	 es 	 	.	''
And	 I 	 van 	 	 put 	 s 	 	his	sandwich	over	here	,	on	top	of	the	pirate	chest	.
And	 I 	 van 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	You	know	what	?	I	need	a	drink	with	my	lunch	.	''
And	so	 I 	 van 	 	 go 	 es 	 	to	get	a	drink	.
And	while	 I 	 van 	 	is	away	the	wind	 come 	 s 	 	,	and	it	 blow 	 s 	 	the	sandwich	down	onto	the	grass	.
And	now	,	here	 come 	 s 	 	the	other	pirate	.
 Th 	 is 	 	pirate	is	 call 	 ed 	 	 Jo 	 shua 	 	.
And	 Jo 	 shua 	 	 al 	 so 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	 love 	 s 	 	cheese	 sandwich 	 es 	 	.
So	 Jo 	 shua 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	cheese	sandwich	and	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	 Y 	 um 	 	 y 	 um 	 	 y 	 um 	 	 y 	 um 	 	 y 	 um 	 	!	I	love	cheese	 sandwich 	 es 	 	.	''
And	he	 put 	 s 	 	his	cheese	sandwich	over	here	on	top	of	the	pirate	chest	.
Child	:	So	,	that	one	is	his	.
RS	:	That	one	is	 Jo 	 shua 	 	's	.	That	's	right	.
Child	:	And	then	his	went	on	the	ground	.
RS	:	That	's	 exact 	 ly 	 	right	.
Child	:	So	he	wo	n't	know	which	one	is	his	.
RS	:	Oh	.	So	now	 Jo 	 shua 	 	 go 	 es 	 	off	to	get	a	drink	.
 I 	 van 	 	 come 	 s 	 	back	and	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	I	want	my	cheese	sandwich	.	''
So	which	one	do	you	think	 I 	 van 	 	is	going	to	take	?
Child	:	I	think	he	is	going	to	take	that	one	.
RS	:	Yeah	,	you	think	he	's	going	to	take	that	one	?	All	right	.	Let	's	see	.
Oh	 yea 	 h 	 	,	you	 we 	 re 	 	right	.	He	took	that	one	.
So	that	's	a	 five 	 - 	 year 	 - 	 old 	 	who	 clear 	 ly 	 	 understand 	 s 	 	that	other	people	can	have	false	 belief 	 s 	 	and	what	the	 con 	 sequence 	 s 	 	are	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 action 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	I	'm	going	to	show	you	a	 three 	 - 	 year 	 - 	 old 	 	who	got	the	same	 puzzl 	 e 	 	.
RS	:	And	 I 	 van 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	I	want	my	cheese	sandwich	.	''
 Whi 	 ch 	 	sandwich	is	he	going	to	take	?
Do	you	think	he	's	going	to	take	that	one	?	Let	's	see	what	 happen 	 s 	 	.
Let	's	see	what	he	 do 	 es 	 	.	 He 	 re 	 	 come 	 s 	 	 I 	 van 	 	.
And	he	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	I	want	my	cheese	sandwich	.	''
And	he	 take 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	one	.
 Uh 	 - 	 oh 	 	.	Why	did	he	take	that	one	?
Child	:	 Hi 	 s 	 	was	on	the	grass	.
So	the	 three 	 - 	 year 	 - 	 old 	 	 do 	 es 	 	two	 thing 	 s 	 	 different 	 ly 	 	.
First	,	he	 predict 	 s 	 	 I 	 van 	 	will	take	the	sandwich	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	his	.
And	second	,	when	he	 s 	 ees 	 	 I 	 van 	 	taking	the	sandwich	where	he	left	his	,	where	we	would	say	he	's	taking	that	one	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 think 	 s 	 	it	's	his	,	the	 three 	 - 	 year 	 - 	 old 	 	 come 	 s 	 	up	with	 an 	 other 	 	 explan 	 ation 	 	:	He	's	not	taking	his	own	sandwich	 be 	 cause 	 	he	 do 	 es 	 	n't	want	it	,	 be 	 cause 	 	now	it	's	 dirt 	 y 	 	,	on	the	ground	.
So	that	's	why	he	's	taking	the	other	sandwich	.
 N 	 ow 	 	of	course	,	 develop 	 ment 	 	 do 	 es 	 	n't	end	at	five	.
And	we	can	see	the	 continu 	 ation 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	process	of	 learn 	 ing 	 	to	think	about	other	people	's	 thought 	 s 	 	by	 up 	 ping 	 	the	 ant 	 e 	 	and	 ask 	 ing 	 	children	now	,	not	for	an	action	 predict 	 ion 	 	,	but	for	a	moral	judgment	.
So	first	I	'm	going	to	show	you	the	 three 	 - 	 year 	 - 	 old 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.
RS	.	:	So	is	 I 	 van 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	mean	and	 naught 	 y 	 	for	taking	 Jo 	 shua 	 	's	sandwich	?
Child	:	Yeah	.
RS	:	Should	 I 	 van 	 	get	in	trouble	for	taking	 Jo 	 shua 	 	's	sandwich	?
Child	:	Yeah	.
So	it	's	 may 	 be 	 	not	surprising	he	 think 	 s 	 	it	was	mean	of	 I 	 van 	 	to	take	 Jo 	 shua 	 	's	sandwich	,	since	he	 think 	 s 	 	 I 	 van 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	took	 Jo 	 shua 	 	's	sandwich	to	avoid	 hav 	 ing 	 	to	eat	his	own	 dirt 	 y 	 	sandwich	.
But	now	I	'm	going	to	show	you	the	 five 	 - 	 year 	 - 	 old 	 	.
 Re 	 member 	 	the	 five 	 - 	 year 	 - 	 old 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	 under 	 stood 	 	why	 I 	 van 	 	took	 Jo 	 shua 	 	's	sandwich	.
RS	:	 Wa 	 s 	 	 I 	 van 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	mean	and	 naught 	 y 	 	for	taking	 Jo 	 shua 	 	's	sandwich	?
Child	:	Um	,	 yea 	 h 	 	.
And	so	,	it	is	not	 un 	 til 	 	age	seven	that	we	get	what	 look 	 s 	 	more	like	an	adult	 respons 	 e 	 	.
RS	:	Should	 I 	 van 	 	get	in	trouble	for	taking	 Jo 	 shua 	 	's	sandwich	?
Child	:	No	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	wind	should	get	in	trouble	.
He	 say 	 s 	 	the	wind	should	get	in	trouble	for	 s 	 witch 	 ing 	 	the	 sandwich 	 es 	 	.
And	now	what	we	've	 start 	 ed 	 	to	do	in	my	lab	is	to	put	children	 in 	 to 	 	the	brain	scanner	and	ask	what	's	going	on	in	 the 	 ir 	 	brain	 a 	 s 	 	they	develop	 th 	 is 	 	ability	to	think	about	other	people	's	 thought 	 s 	 	.
So	the	first	thing	is	that	in	children	we	see	 th 	 is 	 	same	brain	region	,	the	Right	TPJ	,	 be 	 ing 	 	used	while	children	are	 think 	 ing 	 	about	other	people	.
But	it	's	not	 quit 	 e 	 	like	the	adult	brain	.
So	 where 	 a 	 s 	 	in	the	 adult 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	I	told	you	,	 th 	 is 	 	brain	region	is	 al 	 most 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	 special 	 ized 	 	--	it	 do 	 es 	 	 al 	 most 	 	 noth 	 ing 	 	else	 ex 	 cept 	 	for	 think 	 ing 	 	about	other	people	's	 thought 	 s 	 	--	in	children	it	's	much	less	so	,	when	they	are	age	five	to	eight	,	the	age	range	of	the	children	I	just	 show 	 ed 	 	you	.
And	 actual 	 ly 	 	if	we	even	look	at	eight	to	11-year-olds	,	 get 	 ting 	 	 in 	 to 	 	early	adolescence	,	they	still	do	n't	have	 quit 	 e 	 	an	 adult 	 - 	 like 	 	brain	region	.
And	so	,	what	we	can	see	is	that	over	the	course	of	 child 	 hood 	 	and	even	 in 	 to 	 	adolescence	,	both	the	cognitive	system	,	our	mind	's	ability	to	think	about	other	 mind 	 s 	 	,	and	the	brain	system	that	 support 	 s 	 	it	are	 continu 	 ing 	 	,	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	,	to	develop	.
But	of	course	,	 a 	 s 	 	you	're	 prob 	 ably 	 	aware	,	even	in	 adult 	 hood 	 	,	people	differ	from	one	 an 	 other 	 	in	how	good	they	are	at	 think 	 ing 	 	of	other	 mind 	 s 	 	,	how	often	they	do	it	and	how	 accurate 	 ly 	 	.
And	so	what	we	 want 	 ed 	 	to	know	was	,	could	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	among	 adult 	 s 	 	in	how	they	think	about	other	people	's	 thought 	 s 	 	be	 explain 	 ed 	 	in	 term 	 s 	 	of	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	brain	region	?
So	,	the	first	thing	that	we	did	is	we	 g 	 ave 	 	 adult 	 s 	 	a	version	of	the	pirate	problem	that	we	 g 	 ave 	 	to	the	 kid 	 s 	 	.
And	I	'm	going	to	give	that	to	you	now	.
So	 G 	 race 	 	and	her	friend	are	on	a	tour	of	a	chemical	 factor 	 y 	 	,	and	they	take	a	break	for	coffee	.
And	 G 	 race 	 	's	friend	 ask 	 s 	 	for	some	sugar	in	her	coffee	.
 G 	 race 	 	 go 	 es 	 	to	make	the	coffee	and	 find 	 s 	 	by	the	coffee	a	pot	 contain 	 ing 	 	a	white	powder	,	which	is	sugar	.
But	the	powder	is	 label 	 ed 	 	``	 Dead 	 ly 	 	 Poi 	 son 	 	,	''	so	 G 	 race 	 	 think 	 s 	 	that	the	powder	is	a	 dead 	 ly 	 	poison	.
And	she	 put 	 s 	 	it	in	her	friend	's	coffee	.
And	her	friend	 drink 	 s 	 	the	coffee	,	and	is	fine	.
How	 man 	 y 	 	people	think	it	was	 moral 	 ly 	 	 per 	 mis 	 s 	 ible 	 	for	 G 	 race 	 	to	put	the	powder	in	the	coffee	?
 Oka 	 y 	 	.	Good	.
So	we	ask	people	,	how	much	should	 G 	 race 	 	be	 blame 	 d 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	which	we	call	a	 fail 	 ed 	 	attempt	to	harm	?
And	we	can	 compar 	 e 	 	that	to	 an 	 other 	 	case	,	where	 every 	 thing 	 	in	the	real	world	is	the	same	.
The	powder	is	still	sugar	,	but	what	's	different	is	what	 G 	 race 	 	 think 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	she	 think 	 s 	 	the	powder	is	sugar	.
And	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 un 	 surprising 	 ly 	 	,	if	 G 	 race 	 	 think 	 s 	 	the	powder	is	sugar	and	 put 	 s 	 	it	in	her	friend	's	coffee	,	people	say	she	 deserve 	 s 	 	no	blame	at	all	.
 Where 	 a 	 s 	 	if	she	 think 	 s 	 	the	powder	was	poison	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	it	's	 re 	 ally 	 	sugar	,	now	people	say	she	 deserve 	 s 	 	a	lot	of	blame	,	even	 th 	 ough 	 	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	real	world	was	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	.
And	in	fact	,	they	say	she	 deserve 	 s 	 	more	blame	in	 th 	 is 	 	case	,	the	 fail 	 ed 	 	attempt	to	harm	,	than	in	 an 	 other 	 	case	,	which	we	call	an	accident	.
Where	 G 	 race 	 	thought	the	powder	was	sugar	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	 label 	 ed 	 	``	sugar	''	and	by	the	coffee	machine	,	but	 actual 	 ly 	 	the	powder	was	poison	.
So	even	 th 	 ough 	 	when	the	powder	was	poison	,	the	friend	 d 	 rank 	 	the	coffee	and	 di 	 ed 	 	,	people	say	 G 	 race 	 	 deserve 	 s 	 	less	blame	in	that	case	,	when	she	 innoc 	 ent 	 ly 	 	thought	it	was	sugar	,	than	in	the	other	case	,	where	she	thought	it	was	poison	and	no	harm	 occur 	 red 	 	.
People	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	disagree	a	little	bit	about	 exact 	 ly 	 	how	much	blame	 G 	 race 	 	should	get	in	the	accident	case	.
Some	people	think	she	should	deserve	more	blame	,	and	other	people	less	.
And	what	I	'm	going	to	show	you	is	what	 happen 	 ed 	 	when	we	look	 in 	 side 	 	the	 brain 	 s 	 	of	people	while	they	're	making	that	judgment	.
So	what	I	'm	 show 	 ing 	 	you	,	from	left	to	right	,	is	how	much	activity	there	was	in	 th 	 is 	 	brain	region	,	and	from	top	to	bottom	,	how	much	blame	people	 s 	 aid 	 	that	 G 	 race 	 	 deserve 	 d 	 	.
And	what	you	can	see	is	,	on	the	left	when	there	was	 ver 	 y 	 	little	activity	in	 th 	 is 	 	brain	region	,	people	paid	little	attention	to	her	 innoc 	 ent 	 	belief	and	 s 	 aid 	 	she	 deserve 	 d 	 	a	lot	of	blame	for	the	accident	.
 Where 	 a 	 s 	 	on	the	right	,	where	there	was	a	lot	of	activity	,	people	paid	a	lot	more	attention	to	her	 innoc 	 ent 	 	belief	,	and	 s 	 aid 	 	she	 deserve 	 d 	 	a	lot	less	blame	for	 caus 	 ing 	 	the	accident	.
So	that	's	good	,	but	of	course	what	we	'd	 ra 	 ther 	 	is	have	a	way	to	interfere	with	function	in	 th 	 is 	 	brain	region	,	and	see	if	we	could	change	people	's	moral	judgment	.
And	we	do	have	 s 	 uch 	 	a	tool	.
It	's	 call 	 ed 	 	 Trans 	 - 	 Cran 	 ial 	 	 Mag 	 netic 	 	 Stimul 	 ation 	 	,	or	 T 	 MS 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	tool	that	lets	us	pass	a	 magnet 	 ic 	 	 puls 	 e 	 	through	 some 	 body 	 	's	skull	,	 in 	 to 	 	a	small	region	of	 the 	 ir 	 	brain	,	and	 tempor 	 arily 	 	 dis 	 organize 	 	the	function	of	the	 neuro 	 ns 	 	in	that	region	.
So	I	'm	going	to	show	you	a	demo	of	 th 	 is 	 	.
First	,	I	'm	going	to	show	you	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 magnet 	 ic 	 	 puls 	 e 	 	.
I	'm	going	to	show	you	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	you	put	a	quarter	on	the	machine	.
When	you	hear	 click 	 s 	 	,	we	're	 turn 	 ing 	 	the	machine	on	.
So	now	I	'm	going	to	 app 	 ly 	 	that	same	 puls 	 e 	 	to	my	brain	,	to	the	part	of	my	brain	that	 control 	 s 	 	my	hand	.
So	there	is	no	physical	force	,	just	a	 magnet 	 ic 	 	 puls 	 e 	 	.
 Wo 	 man 	 	:	 Read 	 y 	 	,	 Re 	 becca 	 	?	RS	:	Yes	.
 Oka 	 y 	 	,	so	it	 cause 	 s 	 	a	small	 in 	 voluntary 	 	 contract 	 ion 	 	in	my	hand	by	 put 	 ting 	 	a	 magnet 	 ic 	 	 puls 	 e 	 	in	my	brain	.
And	we	can	use	that	same	 puls 	 e 	 	,	now	 appli 	 ed 	 	to	the	 R 	 TPJ 	 	,	to	ask	if	we	can	change	people	's	moral	 judgment 	 s 	 	.
So	these	are	the	 judgment 	 s 	 	I	 show 	 ed 	 	you	before	,	people	's	normal	moral	 judgment 	 s 	 	.
And	then	we	can	 app 	 ly 	 	 T 	 MS 	 	to	the	 R 	 TPJ 	 	and	ask	how	people	's	 judgment 	 s 	 	change	.
And	the	first	thing	is	,	people	can	still	do	 th 	 is 	 	task	 over 	 all 	 	.
So	 the 	 ir 	 	 judgment 	 s 	 	of	the	case	when	 every 	 thing 	 	was	fine	remain	the	same	.	 The 	 y 	 	say	she	 deserve 	 s 	 	no	blame	.
But	in	the	case	of	a	 fail 	 ed 	 	attempt	to	harm	,	where	 G 	 race 	 	thought	that	it	was	poison	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	sugar	,	people	now	say	it	was	more	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	she	 deserve 	 s 	 	less	blame	for	 put 	 ting 	 	the	powder	in	the	coffee	.
And	in	the	case	of	the	accident	,	where	she	thought	that	it	was	sugar	,	but	it	was	 re 	 ally 	 	poison	and	so	she	 caus 	 ed 	 	a	death	,	people	say	that	it	was	less	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	she	 deserve 	 s 	 	more	blame	.
So	what	I	've	told	you	 to 	 day 	 	is	that	people	come	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 e 	 special 	 ly 	 	well	 equi 	 pped 	 	to	think	about	other	people	's	 thought 	 s 	 	.
We	have	a	special	brain	system	that	lets	us	think	about	what	other	people	are	 think 	 ing 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	system	 take 	 s 	 	a	long	time	to	develop	,	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	 through 	 out 	 	the	course	of	 child 	 hood 	 	and	 in 	 to 	 	early	adolescence	.
And	even	in	 adult 	 hood 	 	,	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	brain	region	can	explain	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	among	 adult 	 s 	 	in	how	we	think	about	and	 judg 	 e 	 	other	people	.
But	I	want	to	give	the	last	word	back	to	the	 novel 	 ists 	 	,	and	to	Philip	Roth	,	who	 end 	 ed 	 	by	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	The	fact	 remain 	 s 	 	that	 get 	 ting 	 	people	right	is	not	what	living	is	all	about	 any 	 way 	 	.
It	's	 get 	 ting 	 	them	wrong	that	is	living	.
 Get 	 ting 	 	them	wrong	and	wrong	and	wrong	,	and	then	on	 care 	 ful 	 	 re 	 consider 	 ation 	 	,	 get 	 ting 	 	them	wrong	 aga 	 in 	 	.	''
Thank	you	.
Chris	 And 	 er 	 son 	 	:	So	,	I	have	a	question	.	When	you	start	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	using	 magnet 	 ic 	 	 puls 	 es 	 	to	change	people	's	moral	 judgment 	 s 	 	,	that	 sound 	 s 	 	 alarm 	 ing 	 	.
 P 	 lease 	 	tell	me	that	you	're	not	taking	phone	 call 	 s 	 	from	the	 Pent 	 agon 	 	,	say	.
RS	:	I	'm	not	.
I	mean	,	they	're	 call 	 ing 	 	,	but	I	'm	not	taking	the	call	.
CA	:	 The 	 y 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	are	 call 	 ing 	 	?
So	then	 serious 	 ly 	 	,	you	must	lie	awake	at	night	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 wonder 	 ing 	 	where	 th 	 is 	 	work	 lead 	 s 	 	.
I	mean	,	you	're	 clear 	 ly 	 	an	 in 	 credible 	 	human	 be 	 ing 	 	,	but	 some 	 one 	 	could	take	 th 	 is 	 	knowledge	and	in	some	future	 not 	 - 	 torture 	 	chamber	,	do	 act 	 s 	 	that	people	here	might	be	 worri 	 ed 	 	about	.
RS	:	Yeah	,	we	worry	about	 th 	 is 	 	.
So	,	there	's	a	couple	of	 thing 	 s 	 	to	say	about	 T 	 MS 	 	.
One	is	that	you	ca	n't	be	 T 	 MS 	 ed 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 know 	 ing 	 	it	.
So	it	's	not	a	 sur 	 rep 	 tit 	 ious 	 	technology	.
It	's	 quit 	 e 	 	hard	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	to	get	 t 	 hose 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	small	 change 	 s 	 	.
The	 change 	 s 	 	I	 show 	 ed 	 	you	are	 impress 	 ive 	 	to	me	 be 	 cause 	 	of	what	they	tell	us	about	the	function	of	the	brain	,	but	they	're	small	on	the	scale	of	the	moral	 judgment 	 s 	 	that	we	 actual 	 ly 	 	make	.
And	what	we	 change 	 d 	 	was	not	people	's	moral	 judgment 	 s 	 	when	they	're	 dec 	 id 	 ing 	 	what	to	do	,	when	they	're	making	action	 choice 	 s 	 	.
We	 change 	 d 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	ability	to	 judg 	 e 	 	other	people	's	 action 	 s 	 	.
And	so	,	I	think	of	what	I	'm	 do 	 ing 	 	not	so	much	 a 	 s 	 	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	the	 defend 	 ant 	 	in	a	criminal	trial	,	but	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	the	jury	.
CA	:	 I 	 s 	 	your	work	going	to	lead	to	any	 recommend 	 ations 	 	in	education	,	to	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 br 	 ing 	 	up	a	generation	of	 kid 	 s 	 	able	to	make	 fair 	 er 	 	moral	 judgment 	 s 	 	?
RS	:	That	's	one	of	the	 ideal 	 istic 	 	 hope 	 s 	 	.
The	whole	research	program	here	of	 stud 	 y 	 ing 	 	the	 distinct 	 ive 	 	 part 	 s 	 	of	the	human	brain	is	brand	new	.
 Un 	 til 	 	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	what	we	 k 	 new 	 	about	the	brain	 we 	 re 	 	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	any	other	animal	's	brain	could	do	too	,	so	we	could	 stud 	 y 	 	it	in	animal	 model 	 s 	 	.
We	 k 	 new 	 	how	 brain 	 s 	 	see	,	and	how	they	control	the	body	and	how	they	hear	and	sense	.
And	the	whole	project	of	 understand 	 ing 	 	how	 brain 	 s 	 	do	the	 un 	 ique 	 ly 	 	human	 thing 	 s 	 	--	learn	language	and	abstract	 con 	 cept 	 s 	 	,	and	 think 	 ing 	 	about	other	people	's	 thought 	 s 	 	--	that	's	brand	new	.
And	we	do	n't	know	yet	what	the	 implic 	 ations 	 	will	be	of	 understand 	 ing 	 	it	.
CA	:	So	I	've	got	one	last	question	.	There	is	 th 	 is 	 	thing	 call 	 ed 	 	the	hard	problem	of	 conscious 	 ness 	 	,	that	 puzzl 	 es 	 	a	lot	of	people	.
The	 not 	 ion 	 	that	you	can	understand	why	a	brain	 work 	 s 	 	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	.
But	why	 do 	 es 	 	 any 	 one 	 	have	to	feel	 any 	 thing 	 	?

You	're	a	 brilli 	 ant 	 	young	 neuro 	 scientist 	 	.
I	mean	,	what	 chance 	 s 	 	do	you	think	there	are	that	at	some	time	in	your	 care 	 er 	 	,	 some 	 one 	 	,	you	or	 some 	 one 	 	else	,	is	going	to	come	up	with	some	paradigm	shift	in	 understand 	 ing 	 	what	 seem 	 s 	 	an	 im 	 possible 	 	problem	?

CA	:	Why	?
RS	:	It	's	not	 call 	 ed 	 	the	hard	problem	of	 conscious 	 ness 	 	for	 noth 	 ing 	 	.

 Bla 	 ise 	 	Aguera	y	 Arc 	 a 	 s 	 	 demo 	 s 	 	 augment 	 ed 	 - 	 re 	 ality 	 	 map 	 s 	 
 Ab 	 out 	 	a	year	and	a	half	ago	,	 Step 	 hen 	 	 Law 	 ler 	 	,	who	 al 	 so 	 	 g 	 ave 	 	a	talk	here	at	TED	in	2007	on	Virtual	Earth	,	 br 	 ought 	 	me	over	to	 be 	 come 	 	the	architect	of	 B 	 ing 	 	 Map 	 s 	 	,	which	is	 Micro 	 soft 	 	's	 on 	 line 	 - 	 mapping 	 	effort	.
In	the	past	two	and	a	half	,	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	hard	at	work	on	 re 	 defi 	 ning 	 	the	way	 map 	 s 	 	work	 on 	 line 	 	.
And	we	 re 	 ally 	 	are	 see 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	in	 ver 	 y 	 	different	 term 	 s 	 	from	the	kind	of	mapping	and	direction	 s 	 ite 	 	that	one	is	used	to	.
So	,	the	first	thing	that	you	might	notice	about	the	mapping	 s 	 ite 	 	is	just	the	 fluid 	 ity 	 	of	the	 zoom 	 ing 	 	and	the	 pan 	 ning 	 	,	which	,	if	you	're	familiar	at	all	with	 Sea 	 dragon 	 	,	that	's	where	it	 come 	 s 	 	from	.
 Map 	 ping 	 	is	,	of	course	,	not	just	about	 cart 	 ography 	 	,	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	about	 image 	 ry 	 	.
So	,	 a 	 s 	 	we	 zoom 	 - 	 in 	 	beyond	a	certain	level	 th 	 is 	 	 re 	 solve 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	kind	of	Sim	 City 	 - 	 like 	 	virtual	view	at	45	 degree 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	can	be	 view 	 ed 	 	from	any	of	the	 card 	 in 	 al 	 	 direction 	 s 	 	to	show	you	the	3D	structure	of	the	city	,	all	the	 facade 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	we	see	 th 	 is 	 	space	,	 th 	 is 	 	 three 	 - 	 dimensional 	 	environment	,	 a 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	a	canvas	on	which	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 application 	 s 	 	can	play	out	,	and	map	's	 direction 	 s 	 	are	 re 	 ally 	 	just	one	of	them	.
If	you	click	on	 th 	 is 	 	,	you	'll	see	some	of	the	 one 	 s 	 	that	we	've	put	out	,	just	in	the	past	couple	of	 month 	 s 	 	since	we	've	 launch 	 ed 	 	.
So	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	a	couple	of	 day 	 s 	 	after	the	disaster	in	Haiti	,	we	had	an	 earth 	 quake 	 	map	that	 show 	 ed 	 	before	and	after	 picture 	 s 	 	from	the	sky	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 wonder 	 ful 	 	one	which	I	do	n't	have	time	to	show	you	is	taking	 hyper 	 - 	 local 	 	 blog 	 s 	 	in	real	time	and	mapping	 t 	 hose 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	,	 t 	 hose 	 	 ent 	 ries 	 	to	the	 place 	 s 	 	that	are	 refer 	 red 	 	to	on	the	 blog 	 s 	 	.
It	's	 wonder 	 ful 	 	.
But	I	'm	going	to	show	you	some	more	 can 	 dy 	 	sort	of	stuff	.
So	,	we	see	the	 image 	 ry 	 	,	of	course	,	not	 stop 	 ping 	 	at	the	sky	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	little	green	 bubble 	 s 	 	represent	 photo 	 synth 	 s 	 	that	 user 	 s 	 	have	made	.
I	'm	not	going	to	 d 	 ive 	 	 in 	 to 	 	them	either	,	but	 photo 	 synth 	 s 	 	are	 integrate 	 d 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	map	.
 Every 	 thing 	 	that	's	 case 	 d 	 	in	blue	is	an	area	where	we	've	taken	 image 	 ry 	 	on	the	ground	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	I	'll	show	you	a	 f 	 un 	 	app	that	--	we	've	 be 	 en 	 	 work 	 ing 	 	on	a	 collabor 	 ation 	 	with	our	 friend 	 s 	 	at	Flickr	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 take 	 s 	 	Flickr	,	 geo 	 register 	 ed 	 	 image 	 ry 	 	and	uses	 photo 	 synth 	 - 	 like 	 	 process 	 es 	 	to	connect	that	 image 	 ry 	 	to	our	 image 	 ry 	 	,	so	--	I	'm	not	 s 	 ure 	 	if	that	's	the	one	I	 actual 	 ly 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	to	pull	up	,	but	--	But	notice	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	,	of	course	,	a	popular	tourist	 s 	 ite 	 	,	and	there	are	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 photo 	 s 	 	around	here	,	and	these	 photo 	 s 	 	are	all	taken	at	different	 time 	 s 	 	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	one	was	taken	around	five	.
So	that	's	the	Flickr	photo	,	that	's	our	 image 	 ry 	 	.
So	you	 re 	 ally 	 	see	how	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 crowd 	 - 	 sourced 	 	 image 	 ry 	 	is	 integ 	 rating 	 	,	in	a	 ver 	 y 	 	deep	way	,	 in 	 to 	 	the	map	 it 	 self 	 	.
Thank	you	.
There	are	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 reason 	 s 	 	why	 th 	 is 	 	is	 interest 	 ing 	 	and	one	of	them	,	of	course	,	is	time	travel	.
And	I	'm	not	going	to	show	you	some	of	the	 wonder 	 ful 	 	historic	 image 	 ry 	 	in	here	,	but	there	are	some	with	 horse 	 s 	 	and	 carriage 	 s 	 	and	so	on	 a 	 s 	 	well	.
But	what	's	cool	about	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	is	it	 augment 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	visual	 represent 	 ation 	 	of	the	world	with	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	coming	in	from	 user 	 s 	 	,	but	it	 al 	 so 	 	is	the	 found 	 ation 	 	for	 augment 	 ed 	 	 re 	 ality 	 	,	and	that	's	 some 	 thing 	 	that	I	'll	be	 show 	 ing 	 	you	more	of	in	just	a	moment	.
 N 	 ow 	 	I	just	made	a	 transit 	 ion 	 	 in 	 door 	 s 	 	.	That	's	 al 	 so 	 	 interest 	 ing 	 	.
 O 	 K 	 	,	notice	there	's	now	a	roof	above	us	.
We	're	 in 	 side 	 	the	 Pi 	 ke 	 	Place	Market	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	're	able	to	do	with	a	 back 	 pack 	 	camera	,	so	,	we	're	now	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 im 	 aging 	 	in	the	street	with	 th 	 is 	 	camera	on	 top 	 s 	 	of	 car 	 s 	 	,	but	we	're	 al 	 so 	 	 im 	 aging 	 	 in 	 side 	 	.
And	from	here	,	we	're	able	to	do	the	same	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 registr 	 ation 	 	,	not	 on 	 ly 	 	of	still	 image 	 s 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	of	video	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	is	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	're	now	going	to	try	for	the	first	time	,	live	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 re 	 ally 	 	,	 tru 	 ly 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 frighten 	 ing 	 	.
 O 	 K 	 	.
All	right	,	 guy 	 s 	 	,	are	you	there	?
All	right	.	I	'm	hitting	it	.	I	'm	 punch 	 ing 	 	play	.
I	'm	live	.	All	right	.	There	we	go	.
So	,	these	are	our	 friend 	 s 	 	in	 Pi 	 ke 	 	Place	Market	,	the	lab	.
So	they	're	 broad 	 cast 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	live	.
 O 	 K 	 	,	George	,	can	you	pan	back	over	to	the	corner	market	?
 Be 	 cause 	 	I	want	to	show	 point 	 s 	 	of	interest	.
No	,	no	.	The	other	way	.
Yeah	,	 yea 	 h 	 	,	back	to	the	corner	,	back	to	the	corner	.
I	do	n't	want	to	see	you	 guy 	 s 	 	yet	.
 O 	 K 	 	,	 O 	 K 	 	,	back	to	the	corner	,	back	to	the	corner	,	back	to	the	corner	.
 O 	 K 	 	,	never	mind	.
What	I	 want 	 ed 	 	to	show	you	was	these	 point 	 s 	 	of	interest	over	here	on	top	of	the	image	 be 	 cause 	 	what	that	 give 	 s 	 	you	a	sense	of	is	the	way	,	if	you	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	on	the	spot	,	you	can	think	about	 th 	 is 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	taking	a	step	in	 add 	 ition 	 	to	 augment 	 ed 	 	 re 	 ality 	 	.
What	the	hell	are	you	 guy 	 s 	 	--	oh	,	sorry	.
We	're	 do 	 ing 	 	two	different	--	 O 	 K 	 	,	I	'm	 hang 	 ing 	 	up	now	.
We	're	 do 	 ing 	 	two	different	 thing 	 s 	 	here	.
One	of	them	is	to	take	that	real	...
All	right	,	let	me	just	take	a	moment	and	thank	the	team	.
 The 	 y 	 	've	 d 	 one 	 	a	fantastic	job	of	 pull 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	together	.
I	'm	going	to	abandon	them	now	and	walk	back	 out 	 side 	 	.
And	while	I	walk	 out 	 side 	 	,	I	'll	just	 ment 	 ion 	 	that	here	we	're	using	 th 	 is 	 	for	 tele 	 presence 	 	,	but	you	can	 equal 	 ly 	 	well	use	 th 	 is 	 	on	the	spot	,	for	 augment 	 ed 	 	 re 	 ality 	 	.
When	you	use	it	on	the	spot	,	it	 mean 	 s 	 	that	you	're	able	to	 br 	 ing 	 	all	of	that	 meta 	 data 	 	and	information	about	the	world	to	you	.
So	here	,	we	're	taking	the	extra	step	of	 al 	 so 	 	 broad 	 cast 	 ing 	 	it	.
That	was	 be 	 ing 	 	 broad 	 cast 	 	,	by	the	way	,	on	a	4G	network	from	the	market	.
All	right	,	and	now	there	's	one	last	TED	talk	that	 Micro 	 soft 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 give 	 n 	 	in	the	past	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	 year 	 s 	 	.
And	that	's	 Cu 	 rtis 	 	 W 	 ong 	 	,	 World 	 Wide 	 	 Tele 	 scope 	 	.
So	,	we	're	going	to	head	over	to	the	 dump 	 sters 	 	,	where	it	's	 tradition 	 al 	 	,	after	a	long	day	at	the	market	,	to	go	out	for	a	break	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	 star 	 e 	 	up	at	the	sky	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	 integ 	 ration 	 	of	 World 	 Wide 	 	 Tele 	 scope 	 	 in 	 to 	 	our	 map 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	current	--	thank	you	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	current	time	.	If	we	scrub	the	time	,	then	we	can	see	how	the	sky	will	look	at	different	 time 	 s 	 	,	and	we	can	get	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	 detail 	 ed 	 	information	about	different	 time 	 s 	 	,	different	 date 	 s 	 	:	Let	's	move	the	moon	a	little	 high 	 er 	 	in	the	sky	,	 may 	 be 	 	change	the	date	.
I	would	like	to	kind	of	zoom	in	on	the	moon	.
So	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	an	 astronomical 	 ly 	 	complete	 represent 	 ation 	 	of	the	sky	 integrate 	 d 	 	right	 in 	 to 	 	the	Earth	.
All	right	now	,	I	've	 over 	 run 	 	my	time	,	so	I	've	got	to	stop	.
Thank	you	all	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.

Eve	Ensler	:	 Sud 	 den 	 ly 	 	,	my	body
For	a	long	time	,	there	was	me	,	and	my	body	.
Me	was	 compose 	 d 	 	of	 st 	 ories 	 	,	of	 crav 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	of	 striv 	 ing 	 s 	 	,	of	 desir 	 es 	 	of	the	future	.
Me	was	 try 	 ing 	 	not	to	be	an	 out 	 come 	 	of	my	violent	past	,	but	the	 separat 	 ion 	 	that	had	 al 	 ready 	 	 occur 	 red 	 	between	me	and	my	body	was	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	significant	 out 	 come 	 	.
Me	was	 al 	 ways 	 	 try 	 ing 	 	to	 be 	 come 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	,	 some 	 body 	 	.
Me	 on 	 ly 	 	 exist 	 ed 	 	in	the	 try 	 ing 	 	.
My	body	was	often	in	the	way	.
Me	was	a	 float 	 ing 	 	head	.
For	 year 	 s 	 	,	I	 actual 	 ly 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	 wo 	 re 	 	 hat 	 s 	 	.
It	was	a	way	of	 keep 	 ing 	 	my	head	 attach 	 ed 	 	.
It	was	a	way	of	 loc 	 ating 	 	 my 	 self 	 	.
I	 worri 	 ed 	 	that	[	if	]	I	took	my	hat	off	I	would	n't	be	here	 any 	 more 	 	.
I	 actual 	 ly 	 	had	a	therapist	who	once	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	,	``	Eve	,	you	've	 be 	 en 	 	coming	here	for	two	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	,	to	be	honest	,	it	never	 occur 	 red 	 	to	me	that	you	had	a	body	.	''
All	 th 	 is 	 	time	I	lived	in	the	city	 be 	 cause 	 	,	to	be	honest	,	I	was	 af 	 raid 	 	of	 tree 	 s 	 	.
I	never	had	 bab 	 ies 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	 head 	 s 	 	can	not	give	birth	.
 Bab 	 ies 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	do	n't	come	out	of	your	mouth	.
 A 	 s 	 	I	had	no	 re 	 ference 	 	point	for	my	body	,	I	 beg 	 an 	 	to	ask	other	women	about	 the 	 ir 	 	bodies	--	in	 part 	 icular 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	 vagina 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	I	thought	 vagina 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	kind	of	 import 	 ant 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	led	to	me	writing	``	The	Vagina	 Mon 	 o 	 logues 	 	,	''	which	led	to	me	 obsess 	 ively 	 	and	 incessant 	 ly 	 	 talk 	 ing 	 	about	 vagina 	 s 	 	 every 	 where 	 	I	could	.
I	did	 th 	 is 	 	in	front	of	 man 	 y 	 	 strange 	 rs 	 	.
One	night	on	stage	,	I	 actual 	 ly 	 	 enter 	 ed 	 	my	vagina	.
It	was	an	 ec 	 static 	 	experience	.
It	 scar 	 ed 	 	me	,	it	 energ 	 ized 	 	me	,	and	then	I	 be 	 came 	 	a	driven	person	,	a	driven	vagina	.
I	 beg 	 an 	 	to	see	my	body	like	a	thing	,	a	thing	that	could	move	fast	,	like	a	thing	that	could	accomplish	other	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	all	at	once	.
I	 beg 	 an 	 	to	see	my	body	like	an	iPad	or	a	car	.
I	would	drive	it	and	demand	 thing 	 s 	 	from	it	.
It	had	no	 limit 	 s 	 	.	It	was	 invinc 	 ible 	 	.
It	was	to	be	 conquer 	 ed 	 	and	 master 	 ed 	 	like	the	Earth	 her 	 self 	 	.
I	did	n't	 he 	 ed 	 	it	;	no	,	I	 organize 	 d 	 	it	and	I	 direct 	 ed 	 	it	.
I	did	n't	have	patience	for	my	body	;	I	 snap 	 ped 	 	it	 in 	 to 	 	shape	.
I	was	 greed 	 y 	 	.
I	took	more	than	my	body	had	to	 off 	 er 	 	.
If	I	was	 tire 	 d 	 	,	I	 d 	 rank 	 	more	 espresso 	 s 	 	.
If	I	was	 af 	 raid 	 	,	I	went	to	more	 danger 	 ous 	 	 place 	 s 	 	.
Oh	 s 	 ure 	 	,	 s 	 ure 	 	,	I	had	 moment 	 s 	 	of	 appreci 	 ation 	 	of	my	body	,	the	way	an	 a 	 bus 	 ive 	 	parent	can	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	have	a	moment	of	 kind 	 ness 	 	.
My	father	was	 re 	 ally 	 	kind	to	me	on	my	16th	 birth 	 day 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
I	heard	people	murmur	from	time	to	time	that	I	should	love	my	body	,	so	I	 learn 	 ed 	 	how	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	.
I	was	a	 veget 	 arian 	 	,	I	was	sober	,	I	did	n't	smoke	.
But	all	that	was	just	a	more	 sophistic 	 ated 	 	way	to	 manipul 	 ate 	 	my	body	--	a	further	 dis 	 associ 	 ation 	 	,	like	 plant 	 ing 	 	a	 veget 	 able 	 	field	on	a	 free 	 way 	 	.
 A 	 s 	 	a	result	of	me	 talk 	 ing 	 	so	much	about	my	vagina	,	 man 	 y 	 	women	 start 	 ed 	 	to	tell	me	about	 the 	 ir 	 s 	 	--	 the 	 ir 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	about	 the 	 ir 	 	bodies	.
 Actu 	 ally 	 	,	these	 st 	 ories 	 	 compel 	 led 	 	me	around	the	world	,	and	I	've	 be 	 en 	 	to	over	60	 count 	 ries 	 	.
I	heard	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 st 	 ories 	 	,	and	I	have	to	tell	you	,	there	was	 al 	 ways 	 	 th 	 is 	 	moment	where	the	women	 share 	 d 	 	with	me	that	 part 	 icular 	 	moment	when	she	 separat 	 ed 	 	from	her	body	--	when	she	left	home	.
I	heard	about	women	 be 	 ing 	 	 mole 	 s 	 ted 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 bed 	 s 	 	,	 f 	 log 	 ged 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 burqa 	 s 	 	,	left	for	dead	in	 park 	 ing 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	,	acid	 burn 	 ed 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 kitchen 	 s 	 	.
Some	women	 be 	 came 	 	quiet	and	 disappear 	 ed 	 	.
Other	women	 be 	 came 	 	mad	,	driven	 machine 	 s 	 	like	me	.
In	the	middle	of	my	 travel 	 ing 	 	,	I	 turn 	 ed 	 	40	and	I	 beg 	 an 	 	to	hate	my	body	,	which	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	progress	,	 be 	 cause 	 	at	 l 	 east 	 	my	body	 exist 	 ed 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	to	hate	it	.
Well	my	stomach	--	it	was	my	stomach	I	 hat 	 ed 	 	.
It	was	proof	that	I	had	not	 measur 	 ed 	 	up	,	that	I	was	old	and	not	fabulous	and	not	perfect	or	able	to	fit	 in 	 to 	 	the	 pre 	 determine 	 d 	 	corporate	image	in	shape	.
My	stomach	was	proof	that	I	had	 fail 	 ed 	 	,	that	it	had	 fail 	 ed 	 	me	,	that	it	was	broken	.
My	life	 be 	 came 	 	about	 get 	 ting 	 	rid	of	it	and	 obsess 	 ing 	 	about	 get 	 ting 	 	rid	of	it	.
In	fact	,	it	 be 	 came 	 	so	 extrem 	 e 	 	I	wrote	a	play	about	it	.
But	the	more	I	 talk 	 ed 	 	about	it	,	the	more	 object 	 ified 	 	and	 fragment 	 ed 	 	my	body	 be 	 came 	 	.
It	 be 	 came 	 	 entertain 	 ment 	 	;	it	 be 	 came 	 	a	new	kind	of	 commodit 	 y 	 	,	 some 	 thing 	 	I	was	selling	.
 Th 	 en 	 	I	went	 some 	 where 	 	else	.
I	went	 out 	 side 	 	what	I	thought	I	 k 	 new 	 	.
I	went	to	the	 Democrat 	 ic 	 	 Re 	 public 	 	of	 Con 	 go 	 	.
And	I	heard	 st 	 ories 	 	that	 shatter 	 ed 	 	all	the	other	 st 	 ories 	 	.
I	heard	 st 	 ories 	 	that	got	 in 	 side 	 	my	body	.
I	heard	about	a	little	girl	who	could	n't	stop	 pe 	 e 	 ing 	 	on	 her 	 self 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	so	 man 	 y 	 	grown	 soldier 	 s 	 	had	 shove 	 d 	 	 them 	 s 	 elves 	 	 in 	 side 	 	her	.
I	heard	an	80-year-old	woman	 who 	 s 	 e 	 	 leg 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	broken	and	 pull 	 ed 	 	out	of	her	 socket 	 s 	 	and	 twist 	 ed 	 	up	on	her	head	 a 	 s 	 	the	 soldier 	 s 	 	 rap 	 ed 	 	her	like	that	.
There	are	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	these	 st 	 ories 	 	,	and	 man 	 y 	 	of	the	women	had	 hole 	 s 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	bodies	--	 hole 	 s 	 	,	 fist 	 ula 	 	--	that	 we 	 re 	 	the	 viol 	 ation 	 	of	war	--	 hole 	 s 	 	in	the	fabric	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 soul 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	 saturate 	 d 	 	my	 cell 	 s 	 	and	 nerve 	 s 	 	,	and	to	be	honest	,	I	 stop 	 ped 	 	 sleep 	 ing 	 	for	three	 year 	 s 	 	.
All	the	 st 	 ories 	 	 beg 	 an 	 	to	 ble 	 ed 	 	together	.
The	 rap 	 ing 	 	of	the	Earth	,	the	 pill 	 aging 	 	of	 mineral 	 s 	 	,	the	 destruct 	 ion 	 	of	 vagina 	 s 	 	--	 non 	 e 	 	of	these	 we 	 re 	 	 separat 	 e 	 	 any 	 more 	 	from	each	other	or	me	.
 Mili 	 tias 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 rap 	 ing 	 	 six 	 - 	 month 	 - 	 old 	 	 bab 	 ies 	 	so	that	 count 	 ries 	 	far	away	could	get	access	to	gold	and	 col 	 tan 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 i 	 Phone 	 s 	 	and	 computer 	 s 	 	.
My	body	had	not	 on 	 ly 	 	 be 	 come 	 	a	driven	machine	,	but	it	was	 respons 	 ible 	 	now	for	 destroy 	 ing 	 	other	women	's	bodies	in	 it 	 s 	 	mad	quest	to	make	more	 machine 	 s 	 	to	support	the	speed	and	efficiency	of	my	machine	.
 Th 	 en 	 	I	got	cancer	--	or	I	found	out	I	had	cancer	.
It	 arriv 	 ed 	 	like	a	 speed 	 ing 	 	bird	 s 	 mash 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	 window 	 pane 	 	.
 Sud 	 den 	 ly 	 	,	I	had	a	body	,	a	body	that	was	 prick 	 ed 	 	and	 poke 	 d 	 	and	 punctu 	 red 	 	,	a	body	that	was	cut	wide	open	,	a	body	that	had	 organ 	 s 	 	 re 	 move 	 d 	 	and	 transport 	 ed 	 	and	 re 	 arrange 	 d 	 	and	 re 	 construct 	 ed 	 	,	a	body	that	was	 s 	 can 	 ned 	 	and	had	 tube 	 s 	 	 shove 	 d 	 	down	it	,	a	body	that	was	 burn 	 ing 	 	from	 chemical 	 s 	 	.
Cancer	 explode 	 d 	 	the	wall	of	my	 dis 	 connect 	 ion 	 	.
I	 sudden 	 ly 	 	 under 	 stood 	 	that	the	crisis	in	my	body	was	the	crisis	in	the	world	,	and	it	was	n't	 happen 	 ing 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	it	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	now	.
 Sud 	 den 	 ly 	 	,	my	cancer	was	a	cancer	that	was	 every 	 where 	 	,	the	cancer	of	 cruel 	 ty 	 	,	the	cancer	of	greed	,	the	cancer	that	 get 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	people	who	live	down	the	 street 	 s 	 	from	chemical	 plant 	 s 	 	--	and	they	're	 usual 	 ly 	 	poor	--	the	cancer	 in 	 side 	 	the	coal	 min 	 er 	 	's	 lung 	 s 	 	,	the	cancer	of	stress	for	not	 achiev 	 ing 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	the	cancer	of	buried	trauma	,	the	cancer	in	 cage 	 d 	 	 chicken 	 s 	 	and	 pollute 	 d 	 	fish	,	the	cancer	in	women	's	 uterus 	 es 	 	from	 be 	 ing 	 	 rap 	 ed 	 	,	the	cancer	that	is	 every 	 where 	 	from	our	 care 	 lessness 	 	.
In	his	new	and	 vision 	 ary 	 	book	,	``	New	Self	,	New	World	,	''	the	writer	Philip	 She 	 p 	 herd 	 	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	If	you	are	 divid 	 ed 	 	from	your	body	,	you	are	 al 	 so 	 	 divid 	 ed 	 	from	the	body	of	the	world	,	which	then	 appear 	 s 	 	to	be	other	than	you	or	 separat 	 e 	 	from	you	,	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	the	living	 continu 	 um 	 	to	which	you	belong	.	''
 Be 	 fore 	 	cancer	,	the	world	was	 some 	 thing 	 	other	.
It	was	 a 	 s 	 	if	I	was	living	in	a	 stag 	 nant 	 	pool	and	cancer	 dynam 	 it 	 ed 	 	the	boulder	that	was	 separat 	 ing 	 	me	from	the	 large 	 r 	 	sea	.
 N 	 ow 	 	I	am	 swimm 	 ing 	 	in	it	.
 N 	 ow 	 	I	lay	down	in	the	grass	and	I	rub	my	body	in	it	,	and	I	love	the	mud	on	my	 leg 	 s 	 	and	feet	.
 N 	 ow 	 	I	make	a	 dai 	 ly 	 	 pil 	 grim 	 age 	 	to	visit	a	 part 	 icular 	 	 weep 	 ing 	 	 will 	 ow 	 	by	the	 Se 	 ine 	 	,	and	I	 hung 	 er 	 	for	the	green	 field 	 s 	 	in	the	bush	 out 	 side 	 	Bukavu	.
And	when	it	 rain 	 s 	 	hard	rain	,	I	 s 	 cream 	 	and	I	run	in	 circle 	 s 	 	.
I	know	that	 every 	 thing 	 	is	 connect 	 ed 	 	,	and	the	scar	that	 run 	 s 	 	the	length	of	my	 tors 	 o 	 	is	the	 mark 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	the	 earth 	 quake 	 	.
And	I	am	there	with	the	three	million	in	the	 street 	 s 	 	of	 Port 	 - 	 au 	 - 	 Prince 	 	.
And	the	fire	that	 burn 	 ed 	 	in	me	on	day	three	through	six	of	chemo	is	the	fire	that	is	 burn 	 ing 	 	in	the	 forest 	 s 	 	of	the	world	.
I	know	that	the	abscess	that	grew	around	my	wound	after	the	operation	,	the	16	 ounce 	 s 	 	of	 pu 	 s 	 s 	 	,	is	the	 contami 	 nated 	 	Gulf	of	Mexico	,	and	there	 we 	 re 	 	 oil 	 - 	 drench 	 ed 	 	 pel 	 ic 	 an 	 s 	 	 in 	 side 	 	me	and	dead	 float 	 ing 	 	fish	.
And	the	 catheter 	 s 	 	they	 shove 	 d 	 	 in 	 to 	 	me	 with 	 out 	 	proper	 medic 	 ation 	 	made	me	 s 	 cream 	 	out	the	way	the	Earth	 cri 	 es 	 	out	from	the	 drill 	 ing 	 	.
In	my	second	chemo	,	my	mother	got	 ver 	 y 	 	sick	and	I	went	to	see	her	.
And	in	the	name	of	 connect 	 ed 	 ness 	 	,	the	 on 	 ly 	 	thing	she	 want 	 ed 	 	before	she	 di 	 ed 	 	was	to	be	 br 	 ought 	 	home	by	her	 be 	 love 	 d 	 	Gulf	of	Mexico	.
So	we	 br 	 ought 	 	her	home	,	and	I	 pray 	 ed 	 	that	the	oil	would	n't	wash	up	on	her	beach	before	she	 di 	 ed 	 	.
And	 grat 	 e 	 fully 	 	,	it	did	n't	.
And	she	 di 	 ed 	 	 quiet 	 ly 	 	in	her	 favor 	 ite 	 	place	.
And	a	few	 week 	 s 	 	 lat 	 er 	 	,	I	was	in	New	Orleans	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	spiritual	friend	told	me	she	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	a	 heal 	 ing 	 	for	me	.
And	I	was	 honor 	 ed 	 	.
And	I	went	to	her	house	,	and	it	was	 morn 	 ing 	 	,	and	the	 morn 	 ing 	 	New	Orleans	 s 	 un 	 	was	 filter 	 ing 	 	through	the	 cur 	 tain 	 s 	 	.
And	my	friend	was	 pre 	 par 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	big	bowl	,	and	I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	What	is	it	?	''
And	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	It	's	for	you	.
The	 flower 	 s 	 	make	it	 beaut 	 iful 	 	,	and	the	honey	 make 	 s 	 	it	sweet	.	''
And	I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	But	what	's	the	water	part	?	''
And	in	the	name	of	 connect 	 ed 	 ness 	 	,	she	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Oh	,	it	's	the	Gulf	of	Mexico	.	''
And	I	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	Of	course	it	is	.	''
And	the	other	women	 arriv 	 ed 	 	and	they	 s 	 at 	 	in	a	circle	,	and	 Michael 	 a 	 	 bath 	 ed 	 	my	head	with	the	sacred	water	.
And	she	 s 	 ang 	 	--	I	mean	her	whole	body	 s 	 ang 	 	.
And	the	other	women	 s 	 ang 	 	and	they	 pray 	 ed 	 	for	me	and	my	mother	.
And	 a 	 s 	 	the	warm	Gulf	 wash 	 ed 	 	over	my	naked	head	,	I	 real 	 ized 	 	that	it	held	the	best	and	the	worst	of	us	.
It	was	the	greed	and	 reckless 	 ness 	 	that	led	to	the	 drill 	 ing 	 	explosion	.
It	was	all	the	lies	that	got	told	before	and	after	.
It	was	the	honey	in	the	water	that	made	it	sweet	,	it	was	the	oil	that	made	it	sick	.
It	was	my	head	that	was	bald	--	and	 comfort 	 able 	 	now	 with 	 out 	 	a	hat	.
It	was	my	whole	self	 melt 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 Michael 	 a 	 	's	lap	.
It	was	the	 tear 	 s 	 	that	 we 	 re 	 	 in 	 distinguish 	 able 	 	from	the	Gulf	that	 we 	 re 	 	 fall 	 ing 	 	down	my	cheek	.
It	was	 final 	 ly 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	in	my	body	.
It	was	the	sorrow	that	's	taken	so	long	.
It	was	 find 	 ing 	 	my	place	and	the	huge	 respons 	 ibility 	 	that	 come 	 s 	 	with	 connect 	 ion 	 	.
It	was	the	 continu 	 ing 	 	 deva 	 stat 	 ing 	 	war	in	the	 Con 	 go 	 	and	the	 in 	 differ 	 ence 	 	of	the	world	.
It	was	the	 Con 	 golese 	 	women	who	are	now	 ris 	 ing 	 	up	.
It	was	my	mother	 leav 	 ing 	 	,	just	at	the	moment	that	I	was	 be 	 ing 	 	born	.
It	was	the	 real 	 ization 	 	that	I	had	come	 ver 	 y 	 	close	to	 dy 	 ing 	 	--	in	the	same	way	that	the	Earth	,	our	mother	,	is	 bare 	 ly 	 	 hold 	 ing 	 	on	,	in	the	same	way	that	75	percent	of	the	planet	are	 hard 	 ly 	 	 scrap 	 ing 	 	by	,	in	the	same	way	that	there	is	a	recipe	for	 surviv 	 al 	 	.
What	I	 learn 	 ed 	 	is	it	 ha 	 s 	 	to	do	with	attention	and	 resource 	 s 	 	that	 every 	 body 	 	 deserve 	 s 	 	.
It	was	 advoc 	 ating 	 	 friend 	 s 	 	and	a	 dot 	 ing 	 	sister	.

It	was	people	who	came	with	 spell 	 s 	 	and	 ritual 	 s 	 	.
It	was	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	vision	of	the	future	and	 some 	 thing 	 	to	fight	for	,	 be 	 cause 	 	I	know	 th 	 is 	 	struggle	is	n't	my	own	.
It	was	a	million	 pray 	 ers 	 	.

 So 	 phal 	 	Ear	:	 E 	 s 	 cap 	 ing 	 	the	 K 	 hm 	 er 	 	 Ro 	 uge 	 
I	 normal 	 ly 	 	teach	 course 	 s 	 	on	how	to	 re 	 build 	 	 state 	 s 	 	after	war	.
But	 to 	 day 	 	I	've	got	a	personal	story	to	share	with	you	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	of	my	family	,	my	four	 s 	 i 	 bling 	 s 	 	--	my	mom	and	I	--	taken	in	1977	.
And	we	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 Cambodia 	 ns 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	picture	is	taken	in	Vietnam	.
So	how	did	a	 Cambodia 	 n 	 	family	end	up	in	Vietnam	in	1977	?
Well	to	explain	that	,	I	've	got	a	short	video	clip	to	explain	the	 K 	 hm 	 er 	 	 Ro 	 uge 	 	regime	 dur 	 ing 	 	1975	and	1979	.
 V 	 ideo 	 	:	April	17th	,	1975	.
The	 commun 	 ist 	 	 K 	 hm 	 er 	 	 Ro 	 uge 	 	 enter 	 s 	 	 Ph 	 nom 	 	 Pen 	 h 	 	to	liberate	 the 	 ir 	 	people	from	the	 encroach 	 ing 	 	conflict	in	Vietnam	,	and	American	 bomb 	 ing 	 	 campaign 	 s 	 	.
 L 	 ed 	 	by	 peasant 	 - 	 born 	 	Pol	Pot	,	the	 K 	 hm 	 er 	 	 Ro 	 uge 	 	 evacuate 	 s 	 	people	to	the	 country 	 side 	 	in	order	to	create	a	 r 	 ural 	 	 commun 	 ist 	 	utopia	,	much	like	 Ma 	 o 	 	 Tse 	 - 	 t 	 ung 	 	's	 Cultur 	 al 	 	 R 	 evolution 	 	in	China	.
The	 K 	 hm 	 er 	 	 Ro 	 uge 	 	 close 	 s 	 	the	 door 	 s 	 	to	the	 out 	 side 	 	world	.
But	after	four	 year 	 s 	 	the	grim	truth	 seep 	 s 	 	out	.
In	a	country	of	 on 	 ly 	 	seven	million	people	,	one	and	a	half	million	 we 	 re 	 	 murder 	 ed 	 	by	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 lead 	 ers 	 	,	 the 	 ir 	 	bodies	 pil 	 ed 	 	in	the	mass	 grave 	 s 	 	of	the	 kill 	 ing 	 	 field 	 s 	 	.
 So 	 phal 	 	Ear	:	So	,	 not 	 with 	 stand 	 ing 	 	the	1970s	 nar 	 ration 	 	,	on	April	17th	1975	we	lived	in	 Ph 	 nom 	 	 Pen 	 h 	 	.
And	my	 parent 	 s 	 	 we 	 re 	 	told	by	the	 K 	 hm 	 er 	 	 Ro 	 uge 	 	to	evacuate	the	city	 be 	 cause 	 	of	 imp 	 end 	 ing 	 	American	 bomb 	 ing 	 	for	three	 day 	 s 	 	.
And	here	is	a	picture	of	the	 K 	 hm 	 er 	 	 Ro 	 uge 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	 we 	 re 	 	young	 soldier 	 s 	 	,	 typical 	 ly 	 	child	 soldier 	 s 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	normal	now	,	of	modern	day	conflict	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	're	easy	to	 br 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 war 	 s 	 	.
The	reason	that	they	 g 	 ave 	 	about	American	 bomb 	 ing 	 	was	n't	all	that	far	off	.
I	mean	,	from	1965	to	1973	there	 we 	 re 	 	more	 mun 	 ition 	 s 	 	that	fell	on	Cambodia	than	in	all	of	World	War	 I 	 I 	 	Japan	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	the	two	nuclear	 bomb 	 s 	 	of	 Au 	 gust 	 	1945	.
The	 K 	 hm 	 er 	 	 Ro 	 uge 	 	did	n't	 believ 	 e 	 	in	money	.
So	the	 equi 	 valent 	 	of	the	 Feder 	 al 	 	 Re 	 serve 	 	Bank	in	Cambodia	was	 bomb 	 ed 	 	.
But	not	just	that	,	they	 actual 	 ly 	 	 bann 	 ed 	 	money	.
I	think	it	's	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 precede 	 nt 	 	in	which	money	 ha 	 s 	 	ever	 be 	 en 	 	 stop 	 ped 	 	from	 be 	 ing 	 	used	.
And	we	know	money	is	the	root	of	all	 e 	 vil 	 	,	but	it	did	n't	 actual 	 ly 	 	stop	 e 	 vil 	 	from	 happen 	 ing 	 	in	Cambodia	,	in	fact	.
My	family	was	 move 	 d 	 	from	 Ph 	 nom 	 	 Pen 	 h 	 	to	 Pur 	 s 	 at 	 	 pro 	 vince 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	of	what	 Pur 	 s 	 at 	 	 look 	 s 	 	like	.
It	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 pre 	 tty 	 	area	of	Cambodia	,	where	rice	growing	 take 	 s 	 	place	.
And	in	fact	they	 we 	 re 	 	 force 	 d 	 	to	work	the	 field 	 s 	 	.
So	my	father	and	mother	 end 	 ed 	 	up	in	a	sort	of	 concent 	 ration 	 	camp	,	labor	camp	.
And	it	was	at	that	time	that	my	mother	got	word	from	the	 commun 	 e 	 	chief	that	the	 Vietnam 	 ese 	 	 we 	 re 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	 ask 	 ing 	 	for	 the 	 ir 	 	 citizen 	 s 	 	to	go	back	to	Vietnam	.
And	she	spoke	some	 Vietnam 	 ese 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	a	child	 hav 	 ing 	 	grown	up	with	 Vietnam 	 ese 	 	 friend 	 s 	 	.
And	she	 decide 	 d 	 	,	 de 	 spite 	 	the	 ad 	 vice 	 	of	her	 neighbor 	 s 	 	,	that	she	would	take	the	chance	and	claim	to	be	 Vietnam 	 ese 	 	so	that	we	could	have	a	chance	to	 surviv 	 e 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	at	 th 	 is 	 	point	they	're	forcing	 every 	 body 	 	to	work	.
And	they	're	giving	about	--	in	a	 modern 	 - 	 day 	 	,	 caloric 	 - 	 restrict 	 ion 	 	diet	,	I	guess	--	they	're	giving	 por 	 ridge 	 	,	with	a	few	 grain 	 s 	 	of	rice	.
And	at	about	 th 	 is 	 	time	 actual 	 ly 	 	my	father	got	 ver 	 y 	 	sick	.
And	he	did	n't	speak	 Vietnam 	 ese 	 	.
So	he	 di 	 ed 	 	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	in	 Jan 	 uary 	 	1976	.
And	it	made	it	possible	,	in	fact	,	for	us	to	take	on	 th 	 is 	 	plan	.
So	the	 K 	 hm 	 er 	 	 Ro 	 uge 	 	took	us	from	a	place	 call 	 ed 	 	 Pur 	 s 	 at 	 	to	 Ka 	 oh 	 	 T 	 iev 	 	,	which	is	 a 	 cross 	 	from	the	border	from	Vietnam	.
And	there	they	had	a	 de 	 tent 	 ion 	 	camp	where	 alle 	 ged 	 	 Vietnam 	 ese 	 	would	be	tested	,	language	tested	.
And	my	mother	's	 Vietnam 	 ese 	 	was	so	bad	that	to	make	our	story	more	credible	,	she	'd	 give 	 n 	 	all	the	 boy 	 s 	 	and	 girl 	 s 	 	new	 Vietnam 	 ese 	 	 name 	 s 	 	.
But	she	'd	 give 	 n 	 	the	 boy 	 s 	 	 girl 	 s 	 	'	 name 	 s 	 	,	and	the	 girl 	 s 	 	 boy 	 s 	 	'	 name 	 s 	 	.
And	it	was	n't	 un 	 til 	 	she	met	a	 Vietnam 	 ese 	 	 lad 	 y 	 	who	told	her	 th 	 is 	 	,	and	then	 tutor 	 ed 	 	her	for	two	 day 	 s 	 	 intensive 	 ly 	 	,	that	she	was	able	to	go	 in 	 to 	 	her	 ex 	 am 	 	and	--	you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	was	a	moment	of	truth	.
If	she	 fail 	 s 	 	,	we	're	all	headed	to	the	 gal 	 low 	 s 	 	;	if	she	 pass 	 es 	 	,	we	can	 leav 	 e 	 	to	Vietnam	.
And	she	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	of	course	--	I	'm	here	,	she	 pass 	 es 	 	.
And	we	end	up	in	 H 	 ong 	 	 N 	 gu 	 	on	the	 Vietnam 	 ese 	 	side	.
And	then	 on 	 ward 	 s 	 	to	Chau	Doc	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	of	 H 	 ong 	 	 N 	 gu 	 	,	Vietnam	 to 	 day 	 	.
A	 pre 	 tty 	 	 idy 	 llic 	 	place	on	the	Mekong	 Del 	 ta 	 	.
But	for	us	it	 me 	 ant 	 	 free 	 dom 	 	.
And	 free 	 dom 	 	from	 per 	 sec 	 ution 	 	from	the	 K 	 hm 	 er 	 	 Ro 	 uge 	 	.
Last	year	,	the	 K 	 hm 	 er 	 	 Ro 	 uge 	 	 Tri 	 bun 	 al 	 	,	which	the	 U. 	 N. 	 	is	 help 	 ing 	 	Cambodia	take	on	,	 start 	 ed 	 	,	and	I	 decide 	 d 	 	that	 a 	 s 	 	a	matter	of	record	I	should	file	a	Civil	 Com 	 plain 	 t 	 	with	the	 Tri 	 bun 	 al 	 	about	my	father	's	 pass 	 ing 	 	away	.
And	I	got	word	last	month	that	the	 complain 	 t 	 	was	 official 	 ly 	 	 accept 	 ed 	 	by	the	 K 	 hm 	 er 	 	 Ro 	 uge 	 	 Tri 	 bun 	 al 	 	.
And	it	's	for	me	a	matter	of	justice	for	 histo 	 ry 	 	,	and	 account 	 ability 	 	for	the	future	,	 be 	 cause 	 	Cambodia	 remain 	 s 	 	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	 law 	 less 	 	place	,	at	 time 	 s 	 	.
Five	 year 	 s 	 	ago	my	mother	and	I	went	back	to	Chau	Doc	.
And	she	was	able	to	return	to	a	place	that	for	her	 me 	 ant 	 	 free 	 dom 	 	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	fear	,	 be 	 cause 	 	we	had	just	come	out	of	Cambodia	.
I	'm	happy	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	 to 	 day 	 	,	to	present	her	.
She	's	here	 to 	 day 	 	with	us	in	the	audience	.
Thank	you	mother	.

 In 	 ge 	 	 Miss 	 mahl 	 	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	peace	to	the	 mind 	 s 	 	of	 Afghan 	 istan 	 
So	I	want	to	tell	you	a	story	--	an	 encourag 	 ing 	 	story	--	about	 address 	 ing 	 	 de 	 s 	 per 	 ation 	 	,	 depress 	 ion 	 	and	despair	in	 Afghan 	 istan 	 	,	and	what	we	have	 learn 	 ed 	 	from	it	,	and	how	to	help	people	to	 over 	 come 	 	 trauma 	 tic 	 	 experience 	 s 	 	and	how	to	help	them	to	regain	some	confidence	in	the	time	 a 	 head 	 	--	in	the	future	--	and	how	to	 particip 	 ate 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	in	 every 	 day 	 	life	.
So	,	I	am	a	 Jung 	 ian 	 	 psycho 	 analyst 	 	,	and	I	went	to	 Afghan 	 istan 	 	in	 Jan 	 uary 	 	2004	,	by	chance	,	on	an	 assign 	 ment 	 	for	Medica	 Mon 	 dial 	 e 	 	.
Jung	in	 Afghan 	 istan 	 	--	you	get	the	picture	.
 Afghan 	 istan 	 	is	one	of	the	 poor 	 est 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	in	the	world	,	and	70	percent	of	the	people	are	illiterate	.
War	and	 mal 	 nutrition 	 	 kill 	 s 	 	people	together	with	hope	.
You	may	know	 th 	 is 	 	from	the	media	,	but	what	you	may	not	know	is	that	the	average	age	of	the	Afghan	people	is	17	 year 	 s 	 	old	,	which	 mean 	 s 	 	they	grow	up	in	 s 	 uch 	 	an	environment	and	--	I	repeat	 my 	 self 	 	--	in	30	 year 	 s 	 	of	war	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	 transl 	 ates 	 	 in 	 to 	 	 on 	 going 	 	violence	,	foreign	 interest 	 s 	 	,	 bribe 	 ry 	 	,	 drug 	 s 	 	,	ethnic	 conflict 	 s 	 	,	bad	health	,	shame	,	fear	and	cumulative	 trauma 	 tic 	 	 experience 	 s 	 	.
 Lo 	 c 	 al 	 	and	foreign	 militar 	 y 	 	are	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	build	peace	together	with	the	 donor 	 s 	 	and	the	 government 	 al 	 	and	 non 	 - 	 government 	 al 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	.
And	people	had	hope	,	 y 	 es 	 	,	but	 un 	 til 	 	they	 real 	 ized 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 situ 	 ation 	 	 worsen 	 s 	 	every	day	--	either	 be 	 cause 	 	they	are	 be 	 ing 	 	 kill 	 ed 	 	or	 be 	 cause 	 	,	 some 	 how 	 	,	they	are	 poor 	 er 	 	than	eight	 year 	 s 	 	ago	.
One	figure	for	that	:	54	percent	of	the	children	under	the	age	of	five	 year 	 s 	 	suffer	from	 mal 	 nutrition 	 	.
 Y 	 et 	 	,	there	is	hope	.
One	day	a	man	told	me	,	``	My	future	 do 	 es 	 	not	look	 brilli 	 ant 	 	,	but	I	want	to	have	a	 brilli 	 ant 	 	future	for	my	son	.	''
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	picture	I	took	in	2005	,	 walk 	 ing 	 	on	 Frida 	 y 	 s 	 	over	the	 hill 	 s 	 	in	Kabul	,	and	for	me	it	's	a	 symbol 	 ic 	 	picture	of	an	open	future	for	a	young	generation	.
So	,	 doctor 	 s 	 	 pre 	 scribe 	 	 medic 	 ation 	 	.
And	 donor 	 s 	 	are	 suppose 	 d 	 	to	 br 	 ing 	 	peace	by	building	 school 	 s 	 	and	 road 	 s 	 	.
 Mili 	 tary 	 	collect	 weapon 	 s 	 	,	and	 depress 	 ion 	 	 stay 	 s 	 	 in 	 tact 	 	.
Why	?
 Be 	 cause 	 	people	do	n't	have	 tool 	 s 	 	to	cope	with	it	,	to	get	over	it	.
So	,	soon	after	my	 arriv 	 al 	 	,	I	had	 confirm 	 ed 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	which	I	had	 al 	 ready 	 	known	;	that	my	 instrument 	 s 	 	come	from	the	heart	of	modern	 Euro 	 pe 	 	,	 y 	 es 	 	.
 How 	 ever 	 	,	what	can	wound	us	and	our	 re 	 action 	 	to	 t 	 hose 	 	 wound 	 s 	 	--	they	are	universal	.
And	the	big	 challeng 	 e 	 	was	how	to	understand	the	meaning	of	the	symptom	in	 th 	 is 	 	specific	cultural	 con 	 text 	 	.
After	a	 counsel 	 ing 	 	session	,	a	woman	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	,	``	 Be 	 cause 	 	you	have	felt	me	,	I	can	feel	 my 	 self 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	,	and	I	want	to	 particip 	 ate 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	in	my	family	life	.	''
 Th 	 is 	 	was	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	the	family	is	central	in	 Afghan 	 s 	 	'	social	system	.
No	one	can	 surviv 	 e 	 	 al 	 one 	 	.
And	if	people	feel	used	,	 worth 	 less 	 	and	 a 	 shame 	 d 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 horr 	 ible 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	them	,	then	they	 re 	 treat 	 	,	and	they	fall	 in 	 to 	 	social	 isol 	 ation 	 	,	and	they	do	not	 da 	 re 	 	to	tell	 th 	 is 	 	 e 	 vil 	 	to	other	people	or	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 love 	 d 	 	 one 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	do	not	want	to	burden	them	.
And	 ver 	 y 	 	often	violence	is	a	way	to	cope	with	it	.
 Tra 	 um 	 at 	 ized 	 	people	 al 	 so 	 	 eas 	 ily 	 	lose	control	--	 symptom 	 s 	 	are	 hyper 	 - 	 arousal 	 	and	 memor 	 y 	 	 flash 	 back 	 s 	 	--	so	people	are	in	a	constant	fear	that	 t 	 hose 	 	 horr 	 ible 	 	 feel 	 ing 	 s 	 	of	that	 trauma 	 tic 	 	event	might	come	back	 un 	 expect 	 ed 	 ly 	 	,	 sudden 	 ly 	 	,	and	they	can	not	control	it	.
To	 compens 	 ate 	 	 th 	 is 	 	loss	of	inner	control	,	they	try	to	control	the	 out 	 side 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 understand 	 ably 	 	--	 most 	 ly 	 	the	family	--	and	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	 fit 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	well	 in 	 to 	 	the	 tradition 	 al 	 	side	,	 regress 	 ive 	 	side	,	 repress 	 ive 	 	side	,	 restrict 	 ive 	 	side	of	the	cultural	 con 	 text 	 	.
So	,	 husband 	 s 	 	start	 beat 	 ing 	 	wives	,	 mother 	 s 	 	and	 father 	 s 	 	beat	 the 	 ir 	 	children	,	and	 after 	 ward 	 	,	they	feel	awful	.
 The 	 y 	 	did	not	want	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	it	just	 happen 	 ed 	 	--	they	lost	control	.
The	desperate	try	to	 re 	 store 	 	order	and	 normal 	 ity 	 	,	and	if	we	are	not	able	to	cut	 th 	 is 	 	circle	of	violence	,	it	will	be	 transfer 	 red 	 	to	the	next	generation	 with 	 out 	 	a	doubt	.
And	 part 	 ly 	 	 th 	 is 	 	is	 al 	 ready 	 	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
So	 every 	 body 	 	 need 	 s 	 	a	sense	for	the	future	,	and	the	Afghan	sense	of	the	future	is	 shatter 	 ed 	 	.
But	let	me	repeat	the	 word 	 s 	 	of	the	woman	.
``	 Be 	 cause 	 	you	have	felt	me	,	I	can	feel	 my 	 self 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.	''
So	the	key	here	is	 empath 	 y 	 	.
 Some 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	be	a	witness	to	what	 ha 	 s 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	you	.
 Some 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	feel	how	you	felt	.
And	 some 	 body 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	to	see	you	and	listen	to	you	.
 Every 	 body 	 	must	be	able	to	know	what	he	or	she	 ha 	 s 	 	 experience 	 d 	 	is	true	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	 go 	 es 	 	with	 an 	 other 	 	person	.
So	 every 	 body 	 	must	be	able	to	say	,	``	 Th 	 is 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	to	me	,	and	it	did	 th 	 is 	 	with	me	,	but	I	'm	able	to	live	with	it	,	to	cope	with	it	,	and	to	learn	from	it	.
And	I	want	to	engage	 my 	 self 	 	in	the	bright	future	for	my	children	and	the	children	of	my	children	,	and	I	will	not	 marry 	 - 	 off 	 	my	13	 year 	 - 	 old 	 	daughter	,	''	--	what	 happen 	 s 	 	too	often	in	 Afghan 	 istan 	 	.
So	 some 	 thing 	 	can	be	 d 	 one 	 	,	even	in	 s 	 uch 	 	 extrem 	 e 	 	 environment 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 Afghan 	 istan 	 	.
And	I	 start 	 ed 	 	 think 	 ing 	 	about	a	 counsel 	 ing 	 	program	.
But	,	of	course	,	I	 need 	 ed 	 	help	and	 fund 	 s 	 	.
And	one	 even 	 ing 	 	,	I	was	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	next	to	a	 ver 	 y 	 	nice	 gentle 	 man 	 	in	Kabul	,	and	he	 ask 	 ed 	 	what	I	thought	would	be	good	in	 Afghan 	 istan 	 	.
And	I	 explain 	 ed 	 	to	him	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	I	would	train	 psycho 	 - 	 social 	 	 counsel 	 ors 	 	,	I	would	open	 center 	 s 	 	,	and	I	 explain 	 ed 	 	to	him	why	.
 Th 	 is 	 	man	 g 	 ave 	 	me	his	contact	 detail 	 s 	 	at	the	end	of	the	 even 	 ing 	 	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	If	you	want	to	do	 th 	 is 	 	,	call	me	.	''
At	that	time	,	it	was	the	head	of	 Car 	 ita 	 s 	 	 German 	 y 	 	.
So	,	I	was	able	to	launch	a	 three 	 - 	 year 	 	project	with	 Car 	 ita 	 s 	 	 German 	 y 	 	,	and	we	trained	30	Afghan	women	and	men	,	and	we	 open 	 ed 	 	15	 counsel 	 ing 	 	 center 	 s 	 	in	Kabul	.
 Th 	 is 	 	was	our	sign	--	it	's	 hand 	 - 	 paint 	 ed 	 	,	and	we	had	45	all	over	Kabul	.
 Elev 	 en 	 	thousand	people	came	--	more	than	that	.
And	70	percent	 regain 	 ed 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	 live 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	was	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 excit 	 ing 	 	time	,	 develop 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	with	my	 wonder 	 ful 	 	Afghan	team	.
And	they	are	 work 	 ing 	 	with	me	up	to	 to 	 day 	 	.
We	 develop 	 ed 	 	a	 cultural 	 ly 	 - 	 sensitive 	 	 psycho 	 - 	 social 	 	 counsel 	 ing 	 	approach	.
So	,	from	2008	up	 un 	 til 	 	 to 	 day 	 	,	a	 sub 	 stantial 	 	change	and	step	forward	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	taking	place	.
The	European	 Un 	 ion 	 	 deleg 	 ation 	 	in	Kabul	came	 in 	 to 	 	 th 	 is 	 	and	 hire 	 d 	 	me	to	work	 in 	 side 	 	the	 Mini 	 stry 	 	of	 Pub 	 lic 	 	Health	,	to	lobby	 th 	 is 	 	approach	--	we	 succeed 	 ed 	 	.
We	 revise 	 d 	 	the	mental	health	component	of	the	 prim 	 ary 	 	health	care	 service 	 s 	 	by	 add 	 ing 	 	 psycho 	 - 	 social 	 	care	and	 psycho 	 - 	 social 	 	 counsel 	 ors 	 	to	the	system	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 mean 	 s 	 	,	 certain 	 ly 	 	,	to	 re 	 train 	 	all	health	staff	.
But	for	that	,	we	 al 	 ready 	 	have	the	training	 manual 	 s 	 	,	which	are	approved	by	the	 Mini 	 stry 	 	and	 more 	 over 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	approach	is	now	part	of	the	mental	health	 strat 	 e 	 gy 	 	in	 Afghan 	 istan 	 	.
So	we	 al 	 so 	 	have	 implement 	 ed 	 	it	 al 	 ready 	 	in	some	 select 	 ed 	 	 clinic 	 s 	 	in	three	 pro 	 vince 	 s 	 	,	and	you	are	the	first	to	see	the	 result 	 s 	 	.
We	 want 	 ed 	 	to	know	if	what	is	 be 	 ing 	 	 d 	 one 	 	is	effective	.
And	here	you	can	see	the	 patient 	 s 	 	all	had	 symptom 	 s 	 	of	 depress 	 ion 	 	,	moderate	and	severe	.
And	the	red	line	is	the	 treat 	 ment 	 	 a 	 s 	 	usual	--	 medic 	 ation 	 	with	a	medical	doctor	.
And	all	the	 symptom 	 s 	 	 stay 	 ed 	 	the	same	or	even	got	 wo 	 rse 	 	.
And	the	green	line	is	 treat 	 ment 	 	with	 psycho 	 - 	 social 	 	 counsel 	 ing 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	,	 with 	 out 	 	 medic 	 ation 	 	.
And	you	can	see	the	 symptom 	 s 	 	 al 	 most 	 	 complete 	 ly 	 	go	away	,	and	the	 psycho 	 - 	 social 	 	stress	 ha 	 s 	 	 drop 	 ped 	 	 significant 	 ly 	 	,	which	is	explicable	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	can	not	take	away	the	 psycho 	 - 	 social 	 	 stress 	 es 	 	,	but	you	can	learn	how	to	cope	with	them	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	 make 	 s 	 	us	 ver 	 y 	 	happy	,	 be 	 cause 	 	now	we	 al 	 so 	 	have	some	evidence	that	 th 	 is 	 	is	 work 	 ing 	 	.
So	here	you	see	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	health	 facil 	 ity 	 	in	 North 	 ern 	 	 Afghan 	 istan 	 	,	and	every	 morn 	 ing 	 	it	 look 	 s 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	all	over	.
And	 doctor 	 s 	 	 usual 	 ly 	 	have	three	to	six	 minute 	 s 	 	for	the	 patient 	 s 	 	,	but	now	 th 	 is 	 	will	change	.
 The 	 y 	 	go	to	the	 clinic 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	they	want	to	cure	 the 	 ir 	 	 im 	 mediate 	 	 symptom 	 s 	 	,	and	they	will	find	 some 	 body 	 	to	talk	to	and	discuss	these	 issue 	 s 	 	and	talk	about	what	is	 burden 	 ing 	 	them	and	find	 solution 	 s 	 	,	develop	 the 	 ir 	 	 resource 	 s 	 	,	learn	 tool 	 s 	 	to	solve	 the 	 ir 	 	family	 conflict 	 s 	 	and	gain	some	confidence	in	the	future	.
And	I	would	like	to	share	one	short	vignette	.
``	If	we	 we 	 re 	 	to	have	met	some	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	then	we	would	have	 kill 	 ed 	 	each	other	.
And	now	you	are	 help 	 ing 	 	me	to	regain	some	confidence	in	the	future	.	''
And	 an 	 other 	 	 counsel 	 or 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	after	the	training	,	``	You	know	,	I	never	 k 	 new 	 	why	I	 surviv 	 ed 	 	the	 kill 	 ing 	 s 	 	in	my	village	,	but	now	I	know	,	 be 	 cause 	 	I	am	part	of	a	nucleus	of	a	new	 peace 	 ful 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	in	 Afghan 	 istan 	 	.	''
So	I	 believ 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 ke 	 pt 	 	me	running	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	 re 	 ally 	 	 emancip 	 atory 	 	and	 politic 	 al 	 	 con 	 trib 	 ution 	 	to	peace	and	 reconcili 	 ation 	 	.
And	 al 	 so 	 	--	I	think	--	 with 	 out 	 	 psycho 	 - 	 social 	 	therapy	,	and	 with 	 out 	 	 consider 	 ing 	 	 th 	 is 	 	in	all	 human 	 itarian 	 	 project 	 s 	 	,	we	can	not	 build 	 - 	 up 	 	civil	 socie 	 ties 	 	.
and	I	think	it	must	be	,	can	be	,	could	be	 replicate 	 d 	 	 else 	 where 	 	.
I	thank	you	for	your	attention	.

What	I	'd	like	to	start	off	with	is	an	 observ 	 ation 	 	,	which	is	that	if	I	've	 learn 	 ed 	 	 any 	 thing 	 	over	the	last	year	,	it	's	that	the	 suprem 	 e 	 	 iron 	 y 	 	of	 publish 	 ing 	 	a	book	about	 s 	 low 	 ness 	 	is	that	you	have	to	go	around	promoting	it	 re 	 ally 	 	fast	.
I	seem	to	 s 	 pend 	 	most	of	my	time	these	 day 	 s 	 	 zip 	 ping 	 	from	city	to	city	,	studio	to	studio	,	interview	to	interview	,	 serv 	 ing 	 	up	the	book	in	 re 	 ally 	 	 tin 	 y 	 	 bite 	 - 	 s 	 ize 	 	 chunk 	 s 	 	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	 every 	 one 	 	these	 day 	 s 	 	 want 	 s 	 	to	know	how	to	 s 	 low 	 	down	,	but	they	want	to	know	how	to	 s 	 low 	 	down	 re 	 ally 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.	So	...
so	I	did	a	spot	on	CNN	the	other	day	where	I	 actual 	 ly 	 	 s 	 pent 	 	more	time	in	 make 	 up 	 	than	I	did	 talk 	 ing 	 	on	air	.
And	I	think	that	--	that	's	not	 re 	 ally 	 	surprising	 th 	 ough 	 	,	is	it	?
 Be 	 cause 	 	that	's	kind	of	the	world	that	we	live	in	now	,	a	world	 s 	 tuck 	 	in	 fast 	 - 	 forward 	 	.
A	world	 obsess 	 ed 	 	with	speed	,	with	 do 	 ing 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	 fast 	 er 	 	,	with	 cram 	 ming 	 	more	and	more	 in 	 to 	 	less	and	less	time	.
Every	moment	of	the	day	 feel 	 s 	 	like	a	race	against	the	clock	.
To	borrow	a	phrase	from	 Carr 	 ie 	 	 Fish 	 er 	 	,	which	is	in	my	bio	there	;	I	'll	just	 to 	 s 	 s 	 	it	out	 aga 	 in 	 	--	``	 Th 	 ese 	 	 day 	 s 	 	even	instant	 grat 	 ification 	 	 take 	 s 	 	too	long	.	''
And	if	you	think	about	how	we	to	try	to	make	 thing 	 s 	 	better	,	what	do	we	do	?
No	,	we	speed	them	up	,	do	n't	we	?	So	we	used	to	dial	;	now	we	speed	dial	.
We	used	to	read	;	now	we	speed	read	.	We	used	to	walk	;	now	we	speed	walk	.
And	of	course	,	we	used	to	date	and	now	we	speed	date	.
And	even	 thing 	 s 	 	that	are	by	 the 	 ir 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	nature	 s 	 low 	 	--	we	try	and	speed	them	up	too	.
So	I	was	in	New	York	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	and	I	 walk 	 ed 	 	past	a	gym	that	had	an	 advertise 	 ment 	 	in	the	window	for	a	new	course	,	a	new	 even 	 ing 	 	course	.
And	it	was	for	,	you	 guess 	 ed 	 	it	,	speed	 y 	 oga 	 	.
So	 th 	 is 	 	--	the	perfect	solution	for	 time 	 - 	 starv 	 ed 	 	 professional 	 s 	 	who	want	to	,	you	know	,	 salut 	 e 	 	the	 s 	 un 	 	,	but	 on 	 ly 	 	want	to	give	over	about	20	 minute 	 s 	 	to	it	.
I	mean	,	these	are	sort	of	the	 extrem 	 e 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	,	and	they	're	 am 	 using 	 	and	good	to	laugh	at	.
But	there	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	serious	point	,	and	I	think	that	in	the	 head 	 long 	 	dash	of	 dai 	 ly 	 	life	,	we	often	lose	sight	of	the	damage	that	 th 	 is 	 	 road 	 runner 	 	form	of	living	 do 	 es 	 	to	us	.
We	're	so	 marin 	 ated 	 	in	the	culture	of	speed	that	we	 al 	 most 	 	fail	to	notice	the	toll	it	 take 	 s 	 	on	every	 a 	 spect 	 	of	our	 live 	 s 	 	--	on	our	health	,	our	diet	,	our	work	,	our	 relationship 	 s 	 	,	the	environment	and	our	community	.
And	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	it	 take 	 s 	 	a	 wake 	 - 	 up 	 	call	,	 do 	 es 	 	n't	it	,	to	alert	us	to	the	fact	that	we	're	 hur 	 ry 	 ing 	 	through	our	 live 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	 actual 	 ly 	 	living	them	;	that	we	're	living	the	fast	life	,	 in 	 stead 	 	of	the	good	life	.
And	I	think	for	 man 	 y 	 	people	,	that	 wake 	 - 	 up 	 	call	 take 	 s 	 	the	form	of	an	 ill 	 ness 	 	.
You	know	,	a	 burn 	 out 	 	,	or	 event 	 ual 	 ly 	 	the	body	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	I	ca	n't	take	it	 any 	 more 	 	,	''	and	 throw 	 s 	 	in	the	 to 	 wel 	 	.
Or	 may 	 be 	 	a	relationship	 go 	 es 	 	up	in	smoke	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	n't	had	the	time	,	or	the	patience	,	or	the	 tranquil 	 ity 	 	,	to	be	with	the	other	person	,	to	listen	to	them	.
And	my	 wake 	 - 	 up 	 	call	came	when	I	 start 	 ed 	 	 read 	 ing 	 	 bed 	 time 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	to	my	son	,	and	I	found	that	at	the	end	of	day	,	I	would	go	 in 	 to 	 	his	room	and	I	just	could	n't	 s 	 low 	 	down	--	you	know	,	I	'd	be	speed	 read 	 ing 	 	``	The	Cat	In	The	Hat	.	''
I	'd	be	--	you	know	,	I	'd	be	 skip 	 ping 	 	lines	here	,	 para 	 graph 	 s 	 	there	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	a	whole	page	,	and	of	course	,	my	little	boy	 k 	 new 	 	the	book	 in 	 side 	 	out	,	so	we	would	 quar 	 rel 	 	.
And	what	should	have	 be 	 en 	 	the	most	 relax 	 ing 	 	,	the	most	 intima 	 te 	 	,	the	most	tender	moment	of	the	day	,	when	a	dad	 s 	 it 	 s 	 	down	to	read	to	his	son	,	 be 	 came 	 	 in 	 stead 	 	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	 glad 	 iat 	 orial 	 	battle	of	 will 	 s 	 	,	a	 c 	 lash 	 	between	my	speed	And	 th 	 is 	 	went	on	for	some	time	,	 un 	 til 	 	I	caught	 my 	 self 	 	 s 	 canning 	 	a	 news 	 paper 	 	article	with	 time 	 saving 	 	 tip 	 s 	 	for	fast	people	.
And	one	of	them	made	 re 	 ference 	 	to	a	 s 	 eries 	 	of	 book 	 s 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	``	The	 One 	 - 	 Minute 	 	 B 	 ed 	 time 	 	 St 	 ory 	 	.	''
And	I	 win 	 ce 	 	 say 	 ing 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 word 	 s 	 	now	,	but	my	first	 re 	 action 	 	at	the	time	was	 ver 	 y 	 	different	.
My	first	 re 	 flex 	 	was	to	say	,	``	 Hall 	 el 	 ujah 	 	--	what	a	great	idea	!
 Th 	 is 	 	is	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	I	'm	looking	for	to	speed	up	 bed 	 time 	 	even	more	.	''
But	 thank 	 fully 	 	,	a	light	bulb	went	on	over	my	head	,	and	my	next	 re 	 action 	 	was	 ver 	 y 	 	different	,	and	I	took	a	step	back	,	and	I	thought	,	``	 Who 	 a 	 	--	you	know	,	 ha 	 s 	 	it	 re 	 ally 	 	come	to	 th 	 is 	 	?
Am	I	 re 	 ally 	 	in	 s 	 uch 	 	a	 hur 	 ry 	 	that	I	'm	prepared	to	 f 	 ob 	 	off	my	son	with	a	sound	byte	at	the	end	of	the	day	?	''
And	I	put	away	the	 news 	 paper 	 	--	and	I	was	 get 	 ting 	 	on	a	plane	--	and	I	 s 	 at 	 	there	,	and	I	did	 some 	 thing 	 	I	had	n't	 d 	 one 	 	for	a	long	time	--	which	is	I	did	 noth 	 ing 	 	.
I	just	thought	,	and	I	thought	long	and	hard	.
And	by	the	time	I	got	off	that	plane	,	I	'd	 decide 	 d 	 	I	 want 	 ed 	 	to	do	 some 	 thing 	 	about	it	.
I	 want 	 ed 	 	to	investigate	 th 	 is 	 	whole	 road 	 runner 	 	culture	,	and	what	it	was	 do 	 ing 	 	to	me	and	to	 every 	 one 	 	else	.
And	I	had	two	 question 	 s 	 	in	my	head	.
The	first	was	,	how	did	we	get	so	fast	?
And	the	second	is	,	is	it	possible	,	or	even	 desir 	 able 	 	,	to	 s 	 low 	 	down	?
 N 	 ow 	 	,	if	you	think	about	how	our	world	got	so	 accele 	 rated 	 	,	the	usual	 suspect 	 s 	 	rear	 the 	 ir 	 	 head 	 s 	 	.
You	think	of	,	you	know	,	 urban 	 ization 	 	,	 consumer 	 ism 	 	,	the	 work 	 place 	 	,	technology	.
But	I	think	if	you	cut	through	 t 	 hose 	 	 force 	 s 	 	,	you	get	to	what	might	be	the	 deep 	 er 	 	driver	,	the	nub	of	the	question	,	which	is	how	we	think	about	time	 it 	 self 	 	.
In	other	 culture 	 s 	 	,	time	is	 cycl 	 ical 	 	.
It	's	 s 	 een 	 	 a 	 s 	 	moving	in	great	,	 un 	 hurried 	 	 circle 	 s 	 	.
It	's	 al 	 ways 	 	 renew 	 ing 	 	and	 re 	 fresh 	 ing 	 	 it 	 self 	 	.
 Where 	 a 	 s 	 	in	the	West	,	time	is	linear	.
It	's	a	 fin 	 ite 	 	resource	;	it	's	 al 	 ways 	 	 drain 	 ing 	 	away	.
You	either	use	it	,	or	lose	it	.
``	Time	is	money	,	''	 a 	 s 	 	 Ben 	 jam 	 in 	 	 Frank 	 lin 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	.
And	I	think	what	that	 do 	 es 	 	to	us	 psycho 	 logically 	 	is	it	 create 	 s 	 	an	 equ 	 ation 	 	.
Time	is	scarce	,	so	what	do	we	do	?
Well	--	well	,	we	speed	up	,	do	n't	we	?
We	try	and	do	more	and	more	with	less	and	less	time	.
We	turn	every	moment	of	every	day	 in 	 to 	 	a	race	to	the	finish	line	--	a	finish	line	,	 incident 	 ally 	 	,	that	we	never	reach	,	but	a	finish	line	 non 	 e 	 the 	 less 	 	.
And	I	guess	that	the	question	is	,	is	it	possible	to	break	free	from	that	 mind 	 set 	 	?
And	 thank 	 fully 	 	,	the	answer	is	 y 	 es 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	what	I	 discover 	 ed 	 	,	when	I	 beg 	 an 	 	looking	around	,	that	there	is	a	global	 back 	 lash 	 	against	 th 	 is 	 	culture	that	 tell 	 s 	 	us	that	 fast 	 er 	 	is	 al 	 ways 	 	better	,	and	that	 bus 	 ier 	 	is	best	.
Right	 a 	 cross 	 	the	world	,	people	are	 do 	 ing 	 	the	 un 	 think 	 able 	 	:	they	're	 s 	 low 	 ing 	 	down	,	and	 find 	 ing 	 	that	,	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	 convention 	 al 	 	 wis 	 dom 	 	 tell 	 s 	 	you	that	if	you	 s 	 low 	 	down	,	you	're	road	kill	,	the	 oppos 	 ite 	 	 turn 	 s 	 	out	to	be	true	:	that	by	 s 	 low 	 ing 	 	down	at	the	right	 moment 	 s 	 	,	people	find	that	they	do	 every 	 thing 	 	better	.
 The 	 y 	 	eat	better	;	they	make	love	better	;	they	 exercis 	 e 	 	better	;	they	work	better	;	they	live	better	.
And	,	in	 th 	 is 	 	kind	of	cauldron	of	 moment 	 s 	 	and	 place 	 s 	 	and	 act 	 s 	 	of	 decele 	 ration 	 	,	lie	what	a	lot	of	people	now	refer	to	 a 	 s 	 	the	``	 Inter 	 national 	 	 S 	 low 	 	 Move 	 ment 	 	.	''
 N 	 ow 	 	if	you	'll	permit	me	a	small	act	of	 hypo 	 cri 	 s 	 y 	 	,	I	'll	just	give	you	a	 ver 	 y 	 	quick	 over 	 view 	 	of	what	's	going	on	 in 	 side 	 	the	 S 	 low 	 	 Move 	 ment 	 	.	If	you	think	of	food	,	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	will	have	heard	of	the	 S 	 low 	 	Food	 move 	 ment 	 	.
 Start 	 ed 	 	in	 It 	 a 	 ly 	 	,	but	 ha 	 s 	 	spread	 a 	 cross 	 	the	world	,	and	now	 ha 	 s 	 	100,000	 member 	 s 	 	in	50	 count 	 ries 	 	.
And	it	's	driven	by	a	 ver 	 y 	 	simple	and	 sens 	 ible 	 	 mess 	 age 	 	,	which	is	that	we	get	more	pleasure	and	more	health	from	our	food	when	we	 cultiv 	 ate 	 	,	cook	and	 consum 	 e 	 	it	at	a	 reason 	 able 	 	pace	.
I	think	 al 	 so 	 	the	explosion	of	the	 organ 	 ic 	 	 farm 	 ing 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	,	and	the	 ren 	 aiss 	 ance 	 	of	 farm 	 ers 	 	'	 market 	 s 	 	,	are	other	 illustr 	 ations 	 	of	the	fact	that	people	are	desperate	to	get	away	from	eating	and	 cook 	 ing 	 	and	 cultiv 	 ating 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	food	on	an	industrial	 time 	 table 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	want	to	get	back	to	 s 	 lower 	 	 rhythm 	 s 	 	.
And	out	of	the	 S 	 low 	 	Food	 move 	 ment 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	grown	 some 	 thing 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 S 	 low 	 	 C 	 ities 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	,	which	 ha 	 s 	 	 start 	 ed 	 	in	 It 	 a 	 ly 	 	,	but	 ha 	 s 	 	spread	right	 a 	 cross 	 	 Euro 	 pe 	 	and	beyond	.
And	in	 th 	 is 	 	,	 town 	 s 	 	begin	to	 re 	 think 	 	how	they	organize	the	urban	 land 	 s 	 cape 	 	,	so	that	people	are	 encourag 	 ed 	 	to	 s 	 low 	 	down	and	smell	the	 rose 	 s 	 	and	connect	with	one	 an 	 other 	 	.
So	they	might	 cur 	 b 	 	traffic	,	or	put	in	a	park	bench	,	or	some	green	space	.
And	in	some	ways	,	these	 change 	 s 	 	add	up	to	more	than	the	sum	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 part 	 s 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	I	think	when	a	 S 	 low 	 	City	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	 official 	 ly 	 	a	 S 	 low 	 	City	,	it	's	kind	of	like	a	 philosoph 	 ical 	 	 decla 	 ration 	 	.
It	's	 say 	 ing 	 	to	the	rest	of	world	,	and	to	the	people	in	that	town	,	that	we	 believ 	 e 	 	that	in	the	21st	century	,	 s 	 low 	 ness 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	role	to	play	.
In	medicine	,	I	think	a	lot	of	people	are	 deep 	 ly 	 	 dis 	 illusion 	 ed 	 	with	the	kind	of	 quick 	 - 	 fix 	 	 ment 	 ality 	 	you	find	in	 convention 	 al 	 	medicine	.
And	 million 	 s 	 	of	them	around	the	world	are	 turn 	 ing 	 	to	 comple 	 ment 	 ary 	 	and	 alter 	 native 	 	 form 	 s 	 	of	medicine	,	which	tend	to	tap	 in 	 to 	 	sort	of	 s 	 lower 	 	,	 gentle 	 r 	 	,	more	 hol 	 istic 	 	 form 	 s 	 	of	 heal 	 ing 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	the	jury	is	out	on	 man 	 y 	 	of	these	 comple 	 ment 	 ary 	 	 ther 	 a 	 pies 	 	,	and	I	 personal 	 ly 	 	doubt	that	the	coffee	 ene 	 ma 	 	will	ever	,	you	know	,	gain	 main 	 stream 	 	approval	.
 s 	 uch 	 	 a 	 s 	 	 acu 	 punctu 	 re 	 	and	 mass 	 age 	 	,	and	even	just	 relax 	 ation 	 	,	 clear 	 ly 	 	have	some	kind	of	benefit	.
And	 blue 	 - 	 chip 	 	medical	 college 	 s 	 	 every 	 where 	 	are	 start 	 ing 	 	to	 stud 	 y 	 	these	 thing 	 s 	 	to	find	out	how	they	work	,	and	what	we	might	learn	from	them	.
 S 	 ex 	 	.	There	's	an	awful	lot	of	fast	 s 	 ex 	 	around	,	is	n't	there	?
I	was	coming	to	--	well	--	no	pun	 intend 	 ed 	 	there	.
I	was	making	my	way	,	let	's	say	,	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	to	Oxford	,	and	I	went	through	a	news	agent	,	and	I	saw	a	magazine	,	a	men	's	magazine	,	and	it	 s 	 aid 	 	on	the	front	,	``	How	to	 br 	 ing 	 	your	partner	to	orgasm	in	30	 second 	 s 	 	.	''
So	,	you	know	,	even	 s 	 ex 	 	is	on	a	 stop 	 watch 	 	these	 day 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	you	know	,	I	like	a	 quick 	 ie 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	the	next	person	,	but	I	think	that	there	's	an	awful	lot	to	be	 gain 	 ed 	 	from	 s 	 low 	 	 s 	 ex 	 	--	from	 s 	 low 	 ing 	 	down	in	the	 bed 	 room 	 	.
You	know	,	you	tap	 in 	 to 	 	that	--	 t 	 hose 	 	 deep 	 er 	 	,	sort	of	,	 psycho 	 logical 	 	,	 emotion 	 al 	 	,	spiritual	 current 	 s 	 	,	and	you	get	a	better	orgasm	with	the	 build 	 up 	 	.
You	can	get	more	bang	for	your	buck	,	let	's	say	.
I	mean	,	the	 Point 	 er 	 	 Si 	 sters 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	it	most	 eloquent 	 ly 	 	,	did	n't	they	,	when	they	 s 	 ang 	 	the	 praise 	 s 	 	of	``	a	lover	with	a	 s 	 low 	 	hand	.	''
 N 	 ow 	 	,	we	all	 laugh 	 ed 	 	at	 St 	 ing 	 	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	when	he	went	 Tan 	 tric 	 	,	but	you	 fast 	 - 	 forward 	 	a	few	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	now	you	find	 couple 	 s 	 	of	all	 age 	 s 	 	 flock 	 ing 	 	to	 work 	 shop 	 s 	 	,	or	 may 	 be 	 	just	on	 the 	 ir 	 	own	in	 the 	 ir 	 	own	 bed 	 rooms 	 	,	 find 	 ing 	 	ways	to	put	on	the	 brake 	 s 	 	and	have	better	 s 	 ex 	 	.
And	of	course	,	in	 It 	 a 	 ly 	 	where	--	I	mean	,	 Italian 	 s 	 	 al 	 ways 	 	seem	to	know	where	to	find	 the 	 ir 	 	pleasure	--	they	've	 launch 	 ed 	 	an	official	 S 	 low 	 	 S 	 ex 	 	 move 	 ment 	 	.
The	 work 	 place 	 	.
Right	 a 	 cross 	 	much	of	the	world	--	North	America	 be 	 ing 	 	a	 not 	 able 	 	exception	--	 work 	 ing 	 	 hour 	 s 	 	have	 be 	 en 	 	coming	down	.
And	 Euro 	 pe 	 	is	an	 ex 	 ample 	 	of	that	,	and	people	 find 	 ing 	 	that	 the 	 ir 	 	quality	of	life	 improve 	 s 	 	 a 	 s 	 	they	're	 work 	 ing 	 	less	,	and	 al 	 so 	 	that	 the 	 ir 	 	 hour 	 ly 	 	 product 	 ivity 	 	 go 	 es 	 	up	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	 clear 	 ly 	 	there	are	 problem 	 s 	 	with	the	35-hour	 work 	 week 	 	in	 Franc 	 e 	 	--	too	much	,	too	soon	,	too	rigid	.
But	other	 count 	 ries 	 	in	 Euro 	 pe 	 	,	 not 	 ably 	 	the	 Nor 	 d 	 ic 	 	 count 	 ries 	 	,	are	 show 	 ing 	 	that	it	's	possible	to	have	a	 kick 	 - 	 ass 	 	 eco 	 nomy 	 	 with 	 out 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	a	 work 	 aholic 	 	.
And	 Nor 	 way 	 	,	 Swede 	 n 	 	,	 Den 	 mark 	 	and	 Fin 	 land 	 	now	rank	among	the	top	six	most	competitive	 nation 	 s 	 	on	Earth	,	and	they	work	the	kind	of	 hour 	 s 	 	that	would	make	the	average	American	weep	with	 en 	 vy 	 	.
It	's	not	just	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	these	 day 	 s 	 	,	 adult 	 s 	 	who	 over 	 work 	 	,	 th 	 ough 	 	,	is	it	?	It	's	children	,	too	.
I	'm	37	,	and	my	 child 	 hood 	 	 end 	 ed 	 	in	the	 mid 	 - 	 ' 	 80 	 s 	 	,	and	I	look	at	 kid 	 s 	 	now	,	and	I	'm	just	 amaz 	 ed 	 	by	the	way	they	race	around	with	more	 home 	 work 	 	,	more	 tutor 	 ing 	 	,	more	 extracurricular 	 s 	 	than	we	would	ever	have	 conceiv 	 ed 	 	of	a	generation	ago	.
And	some	of	the	most	 heart 	 rend 	 ing 	 	 email 	 s 	 	that	I	get	on	my	 web 	 s 	 ite 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	from	 adolescent 	 s 	 	 hover 	 ing 	 	on	the	edge	of	 burn 	 out 	 	,	 plead 	 ing 	 	with	me	to	write	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	,	to	help	them	 s 	 low 	 	down	,	to	help	them	get	off	 th 	 is 	 	 full 	 - 	 throttle 	 	 tread 	 mill 	 	.
But	 thank 	 fully 	 	,	there	is	a	 back 	 lash 	 	there	in	 parent 	 ing 	 	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	and	you	're	 find 	 ing 	 	that	,	you	know	,	 town 	 s 	 	in	the	 Unit 	 ed 	 	 Stat 	 es 	 	are	now	 band 	 ing 	 	together	and	 bann 	 ing 	 	 extracurricular 	 s 	 	on	a	 part 	 icular 	 	day	of	the	month	,	so	that	people	can	,	you	know	,	 de 	 compress 	 	and	have	some	family	time	,	and	 s 	 low 	 	down	.
 Home 	 work 	 	is	 an 	 other 	 	thing	.	There	are	 home 	 work 	 	 ban 	 s 	 	 spring 	 ing 	 	up	all	over	the	 develop 	 ed 	 	world	in	 school 	 s 	 	which	had	 be 	 en 	 	 pil 	 ing 	 	on	the	 home 	 work 	 	for	 year 	 s 	 	,	and	now	they	're	 discover 	 ing 	 	that	less	can	be	more	.
So	there	was	a	case	up	in	Scotland	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	where	a	 fee 	 - 	 pay 	 ing 	 	,	 high 	 - 	 achiev 	 ing 	 	private	school	for	 every 	 one 	 	under	the	age	of	13	,	and	the	 high 	 - 	 achiev 	 ing 	 	 parent 	 s 	 	 freak 	 ed 	 	out	and	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	What	are	you	--	you	know	,	our	 kid 	 s 	 	will	fall	''	--	the	 head 	 master 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	No	,	no	,	your	children	need	to	 s 	 low 	 	down	at	the	end	of	the	day	.	''
And	just	 th 	 is 	 	last	month	,	the	 ex 	 am 	 	 result 	 s 	 	came	in	,	and	in	math	,	science	,	 mark 	 s 	 	went	up	20	percent	on	average	last	year	.
And	I	think	what	's	 ver 	 y 	 	 reveal 	 ing 	 	is	that	the	elite	 un 	 ive 	 rs 	 ities 	 	,	who	are	often	 cit 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	the	reason	that	people	drive	 the 	 ir 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	and	 hot 	 house 	 	them	so	much	,	are	 start 	 ing 	 	to	notice	the	 calib 	 er 	 	of	 student 	 s 	 	coming	to	them	is	 fall 	 ing 	 	.	 Th 	 ese 	 	 kid 	 s 	 	have	 wonder 	 ful 	 	 mark 	 s 	 	;	they	have	CVs	 jamm 	 ed 	 	with	 extracurricular 	 s 	 	,	to	the	point	that	would	make	your	 eye 	 s 	 	water	.
But	they	lack	spark	;	they	lack	the	ability	to	think	 creative 	 ly 	 	and	think	 out 	 side 	 	--	they	do	n't	know	how	to	dream	.	And	so	what	these	 I 	 vy 	 	League	 school 	 s 	 	,	and	Oxford	and	 Cam 	 bridge 	 	and	so	on	,	are	 start 	 ing 	 	to	 s 	 end 	 	a	 mess 	 age 	 	to	 parent 	 s 	 	and	 student 	 s 	 	that	they	need	to	put	on	the	 brake 	 s 	 	a	little	bit	.
And	in	Harvard	,	for	 in 	 stance 	 	,	they	 s 	 end 	 	out	a	letter	to	 under 	 graduate 	 s 	 	--	 fresh 	 men 	 	--	 tell 	 ing 	 	them	that	they	'll	get	more	out	of	life	,	and	more	out	of	Harvard	,	if	they	put	on	the	 brake 	 s 	 	,	if	they	do	less	,	but	give	time	to	 thing 	 s 	 	,	the	time	that	 thing 	 s 	 	need	,	to	enjoy	them	,	to	savor	them	.
And	even	if	they	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	do	 noth 	 ing 	 	at	all	.
And	that	letter	is	 call 	 ed 	 	--	 ver 	 y 	 	 reveal 	 ing 	 	,	I	think	--	``	 S 	 low 	 	Down	!	''	--	with	an	 ex 	 clam 	 ation 	 	mark	on	the	end	.
So	 where 	 ver 	 	you	look	,	the	 mess 	 age 	 	,	it	 seem 	 s 	 	to	me	,	is	the	same	:	that	less	is	 ver 	 y 	 	often	more	,	that	 s 	 lower 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	often	better	.	But	that	 s 	 aid 	 	,	of	course	,	it	's	not	that	easy	to	 s 	 low 	 	down	,	is	it	?
I	mean	,	you	heard	that	I	got	a	 speed 	 ing 	 	ticket	while	I	was	 research 	 ing 	 	my	book	on	the	 benefit 	 s 	 	of	 s 	 low 	 ness 	 	,	and	that	's	true	,	but	that	's	not	all	of	it	.
I	was	 actual 	 ly 	 	en	route	to	a	 d 	 inner 	 	held	by	 S 	 low 	 	Food	at	the	time	.
And	if	that	's	not	 s 	 ham 	 ing 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	,	I	got	that	ticket	in	 It 	 a 	 ly 	 	.
And	if	any	of	you	have	ever	driven	on	an	Italian	 high 	 way 	 	,	you	'll	have	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	good	idea	of	how	fast	I	was	going	.
But	why	is	it	so	hard	to	 s 	 low 	 	down	?
I	think	there	are	 vari 	 ous 	 	 reason 	 s 	 	.
One	is	that	speed	is	 f 	 un 	 	,	you	know	,	speed	is	sexy	.
It	's	all	that	 adrenalin 	 e 	 	rush	.	It	's	hard	to	give	it	up	.
I	think	there	's	a	kind	of	 meta 	 physical 	 	dimension	--	that	speed	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	way	of	 wall 	 ing 	 	 our 	 s 	 elves 	 	off	from	the	 big 	 ger 	 	,	 deep 	 er 	 	 question 	 s 	 	.
We	fill	our	head	with	 distract 	 ion 	 	,	with	 bus 	 y 	 ness 	 	,	so	that	we	do	n't	have	to	ask	,	am	I	well	?	Am	I	happy	?	 A 	 re 	 	my	children	growing	up	right	?
 A 	 re 	 	 politic 	 ians 	 	making	good	 decision 	 s 	 	on	my	 be 	 half 	 	?
 An 	 other 	 	reason	--	 al 	 th 	 ough 	 	I	think	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	,	the	most	 power 	 ful 	 	reason	--	why	we	find	it	hard	to	 s 	 low 	 	down	is	the	cultural	taboo	that	we	've	 erect 	 ed 	 	against	 s 	 low 	 ing 	 	down	.
``	 S 	 low 	 	''	is	a	 dirt 	 y 	 	word	in	our	culture	.
It	's	a	 by 	 word 	 	for	``	 laz 	 y 	 	,	''	``	 s 	 lack 	 er 	 	,	''	for	 be 	 ing 	 	 some 	 body 	 	who	 give 	 s 	 	up	.
You	know	,	``	he	's	a	bit	 s 	 low 	 	.	''	It	's	 actual 	 ly 	 	synonymous	with	 be 	 ing 	 	stupid	.
I	guess	what	the	 S 	 low 	 	 Move 	 ment 	 	--	the	purpose	of	the	 S 	 low 	 	 Move 	 ment 	 	,	or	 it 	 s 	 	main	goal	,	 re 	 ally 	 	,	is	to	tackle	that	taboo	,	and	to	say	that	 y 	 es 	 	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 s 	 low 	 	is	not	the	answer	,	that	there	is	 s 	 uch 	 	a	thing	 a 	 s 	 	``	bad	 s 	 low 	 	.	''
You	know	,	I	got	 s 	 tuck 	 	on	the	 M 	 25 	 	,	which	is	a	ring	road	around	London	,	 re 	 cent 	 ly 	 	,	and	 s 	 pent 	 	 three 	 - 	 and 	 - 	 a 	 - 	 half 	 	 hour 	 s 	 	there	.	And	I	can	tell	you	,	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	bad	 s 	 low 	 	.
But	the	new	idea	,	the	sort	of	 revolution 	 ary 	 	idea	,	of	the	 S 	 low 	 	 Move 	 ment 	 	,	is	that	there	is	 s 	 uch 	 	a	thing	 a 	 s 	 	``	good	 s 	 low 	 	,	''	too	.
And	good	 s 	 low 	 	is	,	you	know	,	taking	the	time	to	eat	a	meal	with	your	family	,	with	the	TV	 s 	 witch 	 ed 	 	off	.
Or	taking	the	time	to	look	at	a	problem	from	all	 angle 	 s 	 	in	the	 off 	 ice 	 	to	make	the	best	decision	at	work	.
Or	even	 simpl 	 y 	 	just	taking	the	time	to	 s 	 low 	 	down	and	savor	your	life	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	I	found	most	 up 	 lift 	 ing 	 	about	all	of	 th 	 is 	 	stuff	that	's	 happen 	 ed 	 	around	the	book	since	it	came	out	,	is	the	 re 	 action 	 	to	it	.
And	I	 k 	 new 	 	that	when	my	book	on	 s 	 low 	 ness 	 	came	out	,	it	would	be	 welcome 	 d 	 	by	the	New	Age	brigade	,	but	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 be 	 en 	 	taken	up	,	with	great	 gust 	 o 	 	,	by	the	corporate	world	--	you	know	,	business	press	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	big	 com 	 pan 	 ies 	 	and	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	 organ 	 ization 	 s 	 	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	people	at	the	top	of	the	chain	,	people	like	you	,	I	think	,	are	 start 	 ing 	 	to	 real 	 ize 	 	that	there	's	too	much	speed	in	the	system	,	there	's	too	much	 bus 	 y 	 ness 	 	,	and	it	's	time	to	find	,	or	get	back	to	that	lost	art	of	shifting	 gear 	 s 	 	.
 An 	 other 	 	 encourag 	 ing 	 	sign	,	I	think	,	is	that	it	's	not	just	in	the	 develop 	 ed 	 	world	that	 th 	 is 	 	idea	's	 be 	 en 	 	taken	up	.	In	the	 develop 	 ing 	 	world	,	in	 count 	 ries 	 	that	are	on	the	 ver 	 ge 	 	of	making	that	leap	 in 	 to 	 	first	world	 stat 	 us 	 	--	China	,	Brazil	,	 Thai 	 land 	 	,	 Po 	 land 	 	,	and	so	on	--	these	 count 	 ries 	 	have	 embrace 	 d 	 	the	idea	of	the	 S 	 low 	 	 Move 	 ment 	 	,	 man 	 y 	 	people	in	them	,	and	there	's	a	debate	going	on	in	 the 	 ir 	 	media	,	on	the	 street 	 s 	 	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	I	think	they	're	looking	at	the	West	,	and	they	're	 say 	 ing 	 	,	``	Well	,	we	like	that	 a 	 spect 	 	of	what	you	've	got	,	but	we	're	not	so	 s 	 ure 	 	about	that	.	''
So	all	of	that	 s 	 aid 	 	,	is	it	,	I	guess	,	is	it	possible	?
That	's	 re 	 ally 	 	the	main	question	before	us	 to 	 day 	 	.	 I 	 s 	 	it	possible	to	 s 	 low 	 	down	?	And	I	'm	happy	to	be	able	to	say	to	you	that	the	answer	is	a	 re 	 sound 	 ing 	 	 y 	 es 	 	.
And	I	present	 my 	 self 	 	 a 	 s 	 	Exhibit	A	,	a	kind	of	 reform 	 ed 	 	and	 rehabilit 	 ated 	 	 speed 	 - 	 aholic 	 	.
I	still	love	speed	.	You	know	,	I	live	in	London	,	and	I	work	 a 	 s 	 	a	journalist	,	and	I	enjoy	the	buzz	and	the	 bus 	 y 	 ness 	 	,	and	the	 adrenalin 	 e 	 	rush	that	 come 	 s 	 	from	both	of	 t 	 hose 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	.
I	play	squash	and	ice	 hoc 	 key 	 	,	two	 ver 	 y 	 	fast	 s 	 port 	 s 	 	,	and	I	would	n't	give	them	up	for	the	world	.
But	I	've	 al 	 so 	 	,	over	the	last	year	or	so	,	got	in	touch	with	my	inner	tortoise	.
And	what	that	 mean 	 s 	 	is	that	I	no	 long 	 er 	 	 over 	 load 	 	 my 	 self 	 	 gratuitous 	 ly 	 	.
My	default	mode	is	no	 long 	 er 	 	to	be	a	 rush 	 - 	 aholic 	 	.
I	no	 long 	 er 	 	hear	time	's	 wing 	 ed 	 	 cha 	 riot 	 	 draw 	 ing 	 	near	,	or	at	 l 	 east 	 	not	 a 	 s 	 	much	 a 	 s 	 	I	did	before	.
I	can	 actual 	 ly 	 	hear	it	now	,	 be 	 cause 	 	I	see	my	time	is	 tick 	 ing 	 	off	.
And	the	 up 	 shot 	 	of	all	of	that	is	that	I	 actual 	 ly 	 	feel	a	lot	 hap 	 pi 	 er 	 	,	 health 	 ier 	 	,	more	productive	than	I	ever	have	.
I	feel	like	I	'm	living	my	life	 ra 	 ther 	 	than	 actual 	 ly 	 	just	 rac 	 ing 	 	through	it	.
And	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	,	the	most	 import 	 ant 	 	measure	of	the	success	of	 th 	 is 	 	is	that	I	feel	that	my	 relationship 	 s 	 	are	a	lot	 deep 	 er 	 	,	And	for	me	,	I	guess	,	the	 lit 	 mus 	 	test	for	 whet 	 her 	 	 th 	 is 	 	would	work	,	and	what	it	would	mean	,	was	 al 	 ways 	 	going	to	be	 bed 	 time 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	that	's	sort	of	where	the	journey	 beg 	 an 	 	.	And	there	too	the	news	is	 ros 	 y 	 	.	You	know	,	at	the	end	of	the	day	,	I	go	 in 	 to 	 	my	son	's	room	.
I	do	n't	wear	a	watch	.	I	 s 	 witch 	 	off	my	computer	,	so	I	ca	n't	hear	the	email	 ping 	 ing 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	basket	,	and	I	just	 s 	 low 	 	down	to	his	pace	and	we	read	.
And	 be 	 cause 	 	children	have	 the 	 ir 	 	own	tempo	and	internal	clock	,	they	do	n't	do	quality	time	,	where	you	schedule	10	 minute 	 s 	 	for	them	to	open	up	to	you	.
 The 	 y 	 	need	you	to	move	at	 the 	 ir 	 	rhythm	.
I	find	that	10	 minute 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	a	story	,	you	know	,	my	son	will	 sudden 	 ly 	 	say	,	``	You	know	,	 some 	 thing 	 	 happen 	 ed 	 	in	the	 play 	 ground 	 	 to 	 day 	 	that	 re 	 ally 	 	 both 	 er 	 ed 	 	me	.	''
And	we	'll	go	off	and	have	a	conversation	on	that	.
And	I	now	find	that	 bed 	 time 	 	 st 	 ories 	 	used	to	be	a	box	on	my	 to 	 - 	 do 	 	list	,	 some 	 thing 	 	that	I	 dread 	 ed 	 	,	 be 	 cause 	 	it	was	so	 s 	 low 	 	and	I	had	to	get	through	it	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
It	's	 be 	 come 	 	my	reward	at	the	end	of	the	day	,	 some 	 thing 	 	I	 re 	 ally 	 	 cher 	 ish 	 	.
And	I	have	a	kind	of	 Hol 	 ly 	 wood 	 	 end 	 ing 	 	to	my	talk	 th 	 is 	 	afternoon	,	which	 go 	 es 	 	a	little	bit	like	 th 	 is 	 	:	a	few	 month 	 s 	 	ago	,	I	was	 get 	 ting 	 	ready	to	go	on	 an 	 other 	 	book	tour	,	and	I	had	my	 bag 	 s 	 	 pack 	 ed 	 	.
I	was	 down 	 stair 	 s 	 	by	the	front	door	,	and	I	was	 wait 	 ing 	 	for	a	taxi	,	and	my	son	came	down	the	 stair 	 s 	 	and	he	'd	made	a	card	for	me	.	And	he	was	 carry 	 ing 	 	it	.
He	'd	gone	and	 staple 	 d 	 	two	 card 	 s 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	like	these	,	together	,	and	put	a	 stick 	 er 	 	of	his	 favor 	 ite 	 	character	,	 Tint 	 in 	 	,	on	the	front	.
And	he	 s 	 aid 	 	to	me	,	or	he	 hand 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	to	me	,	and	I	read	it	,	and	it	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	To	 D 	 addy 	 	,	love	 Ben 	 jam 	 in 	 	.	''
And	I	thought	,	``	Aw	,	that	's	 re 	 ally 	 	sweet	.
 I 	 s 	 	that	a	good	luck	on	the	book	tour	card	?	''
And	he	 s 	 aid 	 	,	``	No	,	no	,	no	,	 D 	 addy 	 	--	 th 	 is 	 	is	a	card	for	 be 	 ing 	 	the	best	story	 read 	 er 	 	in	the	world	.	''
And	I	thought	,	``	Yeah	,	you	know	,	 th 	 is 	 	 s 	 low 	 ing 	 	down	thing	 re 	 ally 	 	 do 	 es 	 	work	.	''
Thank	you	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.

Chris	 And 	 er 	 son 	 	:	Let	's	now	see	the	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	speech	that	we	 capture 	 d 	 	a	couple	 week 	 s 	 	ago	.
Jose	 Anton 	 io 	 	 Ab 	 re 	 u 	 	:	My	dear	 friend 	 s 	 	,	 lad 	 ies 	 	and	 gentle 	 men 	 	,	I	am	 over 	 joy 	 ed 	 	 to 	 day 	 	at	 be 	 ing 	 	 a 	 ward 	 ed 	 	the	TED	Prize	on	 be 	 half 	 	of	all	the	 distinguish 	 ed 	 	music	 teacher 	 s 	 	,	 artist 	 s 	 	and	 educ 	 ators 	 	from	Venezuela	who	have	 self 	 lessly 	 	and	 loyal 	 ly 	 	 accompani 	 ed 	 	me	for	35	 year 	 s 	 	in	 found 	 ing 	 	,	growing	and	 develop 	 ing 	 	in	Venezuela	the	National	System	of	 You 	 th 	 	and	 Child 	 ren 	 	's	 Orchestra 	 s 	 	and	 Choi 	 rs 	 	.
Since	I	was	a	boy	,	in	my	early	 child 	 hood 	 	,	I	 al 	 ways 	 	 want 	 ed 	 	to	be	a	 music 	 ian 	 	,	and	,	thank	God	,	I	made	it	.
From	my	 teacher 	 s 	 	,	my	family	and	my	community	,	I	had	all	the	 necess 	 ary 	 	support	to	 be 	 come 	 	a	 music 	 ian 	 	.
All	my	life	I	've	 dream 	 ed 	 	that	all	 Venezuela 	 n 	 	children	have	the	same	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	that	I	had	.
From	that	 desir 	 e 	 	and	from	my	heart	 stem 	 med 	 	the	idea	to	make	music	a	deep	and	global	 re 	 ality 	 	for	my	country	.
From	the	 ver 	 y 	 	first	 rehears 	 al 	 	,	I	saw	the	bright	future	 a 	 head 	 	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	the	 rehears 	 al 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	a	great	 challeng 	 e 	 	to	me	.
I	had	 receiv 	 ed 	 	a	 don 	 ation 	 	of	50	music	 stand 	 s 	 	to	be	used	by	100	 boy 	 s 	 	in	that	 rehears 	 al 	 	.
When	I	 arriv 	 ed 	 	at	the	 rehears 	 al 	 	,	 on 	 ly 	 	11	 kid 	 s 	 	had	 show 	 n 	 	up	,	and	I	 s 	 aid 	 	to	 my 	 self 	 	,	``	Do	I	close	the	program	or	 multi 	 ply 	 	these	 kid 	 s 	 	?	''
I	 decide 	 d 	 	to	face	the	 challeng 	 e 	 	,	and	on	that	same	night	,	I	 promise 	 d 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	11	children	I	'd	turn	our	orchestra	 in 	 to 	 	one	of	the	 lead 	 ing 	 	 orchestra 	 s 	 	in	the	world	.
Two	 month 	 s 	 	ago	,	I	 remember 	 ed 	 	that	promise	I	made	,	when	a	 distinguish 	 ed 	 	English	critic	 publish 	 ed 	 	an	article	in	the	London	 Time 	 s 	 	,	 ask 	 ing 	 	who	could	be	the	winner	of	the	Orchestra	World	 C 	 up 	 	.
He	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	four	great	world	 orchestra 	 s 	 	,	and	the	fifth	one	was	Venezuela	's	 You 	 th 	 	 Sym 	 phony 	 	Orchestra	.
 To 	 day 	 	we	can	say	that	art	in	 Lat 	 in 	 	America	is	no	 long 	 er 	 	a	 monopol 	 y 	 	of	 elite 	 s 	 	and	that	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	a	social	right	,	a	right	for	all	the	people	.
Child	:	There	is	no	 differ 	 ence 	 	here	between	 class 	 es 	 	,	nor	white	or	black	,	nor	if	you	have	money	or	not	.
 Sim 	 ply 	 	,	if	you	are	 talent 	 ed 	 	,	if	you	have	the	 voc 	 ation 	 	and	the	will	to	be	here	,	you	get	in	.	You	share	with	us	and	make	music	.
 J 	 A 	 	:	 Dur 	 ing 	 	the	 re 	 cent 	 	tour	by	the	 Sim 	 on 	 	 Bo 	 liv 	 ar 	 	 You 	 th 	 	Orchestra	of	Venezuela	of	U.S.	and	 Euro 	 pe 	 	,	we	saw	how	our	music	 move 	 d 	 	young	 audience 	 s 	 	to	the	bottom	of	 the 	 ir 	 	 soul 	 s 	 	,	how	children	and	 adolescent 	 s 	 	 rush 	 ed 	 	up	to	the	stage	to	 receiv 	 e 	 	the	 jacket 	 s 	 	from	our	 music 	 ians 	 	,	how	the	 stand 	 ing 	 	 ov 	 ations 	 	,	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	30	 minute 	 s 	 	long	,	 seem 	 ed 	 	to	last	 fore 	 ver 	 	,	and	how	the	public	,	after	the	concert	was	over	,	went	out	 in 	 to 	 	the	street	to	greet	our	young	people	in	triumph	.
 Th 	 is 	 	 me 	 ant 	 	not	 on 	 ly 	 	an	 art 	 istic 	 	triumph	,	but	 al 	 so 	 	a	 pro 	 found 	 	 emotion 	 al 	 	 sympath 	 y 	 	between	the	public	of	the	most	 advance 	 d 	 	 nation 	 s 	 	of	the	world	and	the	musical	youth	of	 Lat 	 in 	 	America	,	 a 	 s 	 	 s 	 een 	 	in	Venezuela	,	giving	these	 audience 	 s 	 	a	 mess 	 age 	 	of	music	,	 vital 	 ity 	 	,	energy	,	 ent 	 husiasm 	 	and	strength	.
In	 it 	 s 	 	 es 	 s 	 ence 	 	,	the	orchestra	and	the	choir	are	much	more	than	 art 	 istic 	 	 structure 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	are	 ex 	 ample 	 s 	 	and	 school 	 s 	 	of	social	life	,	 be 	 cause 	 	to	 s 	 ing 	 	and	to	play	together	 mean 	 s 	 	to	 intima 	 te 	 ly 	 	 co 	 exist 	 	 to 	 ward 	 	 perfect 	 ion 	 	and	excellence	,	 follow 	 ing 	 	a	strict	discipline	of	 organ 	 ization 	 	and	 coordi 	 nation 	 	in	order	to	seek	the	 harmon 	 ic 	 	 inter 	 depend 	 ence 	 	of	 voice 	 s 	 	and	 instrument 	 s 	 	.
That	's	how	they	build	a	spirit	of	 solid 	 arity 	 	and	 fratern 	 ity 	 	among	them	,	develop	 the 	 ir 	 	 self 	 - 	 esteem 	 	and	foster	the	 ethic 	 al 	 	and	 aesthetic 	 al 	 	 value 	 s 	 	related	to	the	music	in	all	 it 	 s 	 	 sense 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	why	music	is	 immense 	 ly 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	in	the	 awake 	 ning 	 	of	 sens 	 ibility 	 	,	in	the	 for 	 ging 	 	of	 value 	 s 	 	and	in	the	training	of	 young 	 sters 	 	to	teach	other	 kid 	 s 	 	.
Child	:	After	all	 th 	 is 	 	time	here	,	music	is	life	.
 No 	 thing 	 	else	.
Music	is	life	.
 J 	 A 	 	:	 E 	 ach 	 	teenager	and	child	in	El	Sistema	 ha 	 s 	 	his	own	story	,	and	they	are	all	 import 	 ant 	 	and	of	great	 sign 	 ific 	 ance 	 	to	me	.
Let	me	 ment 	 ion 	 	the	case	of	 Ed 	 ic 	 son 	 	 Ru 	 iz 	 	.
He	is	a	boy	from	a	 par 	 ish 	 	in	 Car 	 acas 	 	who	 passionate 	 ly 	 	 attend 	 ed 	 	to	his	double	 bas 	 s 	 	 less 	 on 	 s 	 	at	the	San	 Agus 	 tin 	 	's	 Juni 	 or 	 	Orchestra	.
With	his	effort	,	and	the	support	of	his	mother	,	his	family	and	his	community	,	he	 be 	 came 	 	a	principal	member	in	the	double	 bas 	 s 	 	segment	of	the	 Ber 	 lin 	 	 Phil 	 harmon 	 ic 	 	Orchestra	.
We	have	 an 	 other 	 	 well 	 - 	 known 	 	case	--	 Gus 	 ta 	 vo 	 	Dudamel	.
He	 start 	 ed 	 	 a 	 s 	 	a	boy	member	of	the	children	's	orchestra	in	his	 home 	 town 	 	,	 Bar 	 qui 	 simeto 	 	.
There	,	he	grew	 a 	 s 	 	a	 viol 	 in 	 ist 	 	and	 a 	 s 	 	a	conductor	.
He	 be 	 came 	 	the	conductor	of	Venezuela	's	 juni 	 or 	 	 orchestra 	 s 	 	,	and	 to 	 day 	 	 conduct 	 s 	 	the	world	's	 great 	 est 	 	 orchestra 	 s 	 	.
He	is	the	musical	director	of	 Lo 	 s 	 	 Angel 	 es 	 	 Phil 	 harmon 	 ic 	 	,	and	is	still	the	 over 	 all 	 	 lead 	 er 	 	of	Venezuela	's	 juni 	 or 	 	 orchestra 	 s 	 	.
He	was	the	conductor	of	the	 Go 	 then 	 burg 	 	 Sym 	 phony 	 	Orchestra	,	and	he	's	an	 un 	 beat 	 able 	 	 ex 	 ample 	 	for	young	 music 	 ians 	 	in	 Lat 	 in 	 	America	and	the	world	.
The	structure	of	El	Sistema	is	based	on	a	new	and	 flex 	 ible 	 	 man 	 aging 	 	style	 adapt 	 ed 	 	to	the	 feature 	 s 	 	of	each	community	and	region	,	and	 to 	 day 	 	 attend 	 s 	 	to	300,000	children	of	the	lower	and	middle	class	all	over	Venezuela	.
It	's	a	program	of	social	 rescu 	 e 	 	and	deep	cultural	 transform 	 ation 	 	designed	for	the	whole	 Venezuela 	 n 	 	 socie 	 ty 	 	with	 absolute 	 ly 	 	no	 distinct 	 ions 	 	 what 	 so 	 ever 	 	,	but	 emphas 	 izing 	 	the	 vulner 	 able 	 	and	 en 	 danger 	 ed 	 	social	 group 	 s 	 	.
The	effect	of	El	Sistema	is	felt	in	three	fundamental	 circle 	 s 	 	:	in	the	 personal 	 / 	 social 	 	circle	,	in	the	family	circle	and	in	the	community	.
In	the	 personal 	 / 	 social 	 	circle	,	the	children	in	the	 orchestra 	 s 	 	and	 choir 	 s 	 	develop	 the 	 ir 	 	intellectual	and	 emotion 	 al 	 	side	.
The	music	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	source	for	 develop 	 ing 	 	the	 dimension 	 s 	 	of	the	human	 be 	 ing 	 	,	thus	 elev 	 ating 	 	the	spirit	and	 lead 	 ing 	 	man	to	a	full	 develop 	 ment 	 	of	his	 personal 	 ity 	 	.
So	,	the	 emotion 	 al 	 	and	intellectual	 profit 	 s 	 	are	huge	--	the	 acquisit 	 ion 	 	of	 lead 	 er 	 ship 	 	,	 teach 	 ing 	 	and	training	 principle 	 s 	 	,	the	sense	of	 commit 	 ment 	 	,	 respons 	 ibility 	 	,	 gene 	 ros 	 ity 	 	and	 d 	 ed 	 ic 	 ation 	 	to	 other 	 s 	 	,	and	the	individual	 con 	 trib 	 ution 	 	to	 achiev 	 e 	 	great	 collect 	 ive 	 	 goal 	 s 	 	.
All	 th 	 is 	 	 lead 	 s 	 	to	the	 develop 	 ment 	 	of	 self 	 - 	 esteem 	 	and	confidence	.
Mother	Teresa	of	 Cal 	 cut 	 ta 	 	 insist 	 ed 	 	on	 some 	 thing 	 	that	 al 	 ways 	 	 impress 	 ed 	 	me	:	the	most	 mis 	 er 	 able 	 	and	tragic	thing	about	poverty	is	not	the	lack	of	bread	or	roof	,	but	the	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	 be 	 ing 	 	 no 	 - 	 one 	 	--	the	 feel 	 ing 	 	of	not	 be 	 ing 	 	 any 	 one 	 	,	the	lack	of	 ident 	 ification 	 	,	the	lack	of	public	esteem	.
That	's	why	the	child	's	 develop 	 ment 	 	in	the	orchestra	and	the	choir	 provide 	 s 	 	him	with	a	noble	 ident 	 ity 	 	and	 make 	 s 	 	him	a	role	model	for	his	family	and	community	.
It	 make 	 s 	 	him	a	better	student	at	school	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 inspire 	 s 	 	in	him	a	sense	of	 respons 	 ibility 	 	,	 persever 	 ance 	 	and	 punctu 	 ality 	 	that	will	 great 	 ly 	 	help	him	at	school	.
 With 	 in 	 	the	family	,	the	 parent 	 s 	 	'	support	is	 un 	 condition 	 al 	 	.
The	child	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	role	model	for	both	his	 parent 	 s 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	is	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	for	a	poor	child	.
 O 	 nce 	 	the	child	 discover 	 s 	 	he	is	 import 	 ant 	 	to	his	family	,	he	 begin 	 s 	 	to	seek	new	ways	of	 improv 	 ing 	 	 him 	 self 	 	and	 hope 	 s 	 	better	for	 him 	 self 	 	and	his	community	.
 Al 	 so 	 	,	he	 hope 	 s 	 	for	social	and	economic	 improve 	 ments 	 	for	his	own	family	.
All	 th 	 is 	 	 make 	 s 	 	up	a	 construct 	 ive 	 	and	 ascend 	 ing 	 	social	dynamic	.
The	large	 major 	 ity 	 	of	our	children	belong	,	 a 	 s 	 	I	 al 	 ready 	 	 ment 	 ion 	 ed 	 	,	to	the	most	 vulner 	 able 	 	 strat 	 a 	 	of	the	 Venezuela 	 n 	 	population	.
That	 encourag 	 es 	 	them	to	embrace	new	 dream 	 s 	 	,	new	 goal 	 s 	 	,	and	progress	in	the	 vari 	 ous 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	that	music	 ha 	 s 	 	to	 off 	 er 	 	.
 Fin 	 ally 	 	,	in	the	circle	of	the	community	,	the	 orchestra 	 s 	 	prove	to	be	the	creative	 space 	 s 	 	of	culture	and	 source 	 s 	 	of	 ex 	 change 	 	and	new	 meaning 	 s 	 	.
The	 spontane 	 ity 	 	music	 ha 	 s 	 	 exclude 	 s 	 	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	 luxur 	 y 	 	item	and	 make 	 s 	 	it	a	 pa 	 trim 	 ony 	 	of	 socie 	 ty 	 	.
It	's	what	 make 	 s 	 	a	child	play	a	 viol 	 in 	 	at	home	,	while	his	father	 work 	 s 	 	in	his	 carp 	 entry 	 	.
It	's	what	 make 	 s 	 	a	little	girl	play	the	 clar 	 inet 	 	at	home	,	while	her	mother	 do 	 es 	 	the	 house 	 work 	 	.
The	idea	is	that	the	 f 	 ami 	 lies 	 	join	with	 pri 	 de 	 	and	joy	in	the	 activ 	 ities 	 	of	the	 orchestra 	 s 	 	and	the	 choir 	 s 	 	that	 the 	 ir 	 	children	belong	to	.
The	huge	spiritual	world	that	music	 produce 	 s 	 	in	 it 	 self 	 	,	which	 al 	 so 	 	lies	 with 	 in 	 	 it 	 self 	 	,	 end 	 s 	 	up	 over 	 coming 	 	material	poverty	.
From	the	minute	a	child	's	taught	how	to	play	an	instrument	,	he	's	no	 long 	 er 	 	poor	.
He	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	a	child	in	progress	 head 	 ing 	 	for	a	professional	level	,	who	'll	 lat 	 er 	 	 be 	 come 	 	a	full	citizen	.
 Needle 	 s 	 s 	 	to	say	that	music	is	the	number	one	 prevent 	 ion 	 	against	 pro 	 stit 	 ution 	 	,	violence	,	bad	 habit 	 s 	 	,	and	 every 	 thing 	 	 de 	 grad 	 ing 	 	in	the	life	of	a	child	.
A	few	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	historian	 Arno 	 ld 	 	 Toy 	 n 	 bee 	 	 s 	 aid 	 	that	the	world	was	 suffer 	 ing 	 	a	huge	spiritual	crisis	.
Not	an	economic	or	social	crisis	,	but	a	spiritual	one	.
I	 believ 	 e 	 	that	to	confront	 s 	 uch 	 	a	crisis	,	 on 	 ly 	 	art	and	 relig 	 ion 	 	can	give	proper	 answer 	 s 	 	to	 human 	 ity 	 	,	to	 man 	 kind 	 	's	 deep 	 est 	 	 aspir 	 ations 	 	,	and	to	the	historic	 demand 	 s 	 	of	our	 time 	 s 	 	.
 Educ 	 ation 	 	--	the	synthesis	of	 wis 	 dom 	 	and	knowledge	--	is	the	 mean 	 s 	 	to	 striv 	 e 	 	for	a	more	perfect	,	more	aware	,	more	noble	and	more	just	 socie 	 ty 	 	.

 Char 	 les 	 	 And 	 er 	 son 	 	 discover 	 s 	 	 dragon 	 flies 	 	that	cross	 ocean 	 s 	 
 Actu 	 ally 	 	,	I	come	from	 Brit 	 ain 	 	,	but	I	've	 be 	 en 	 	living	in	 Mal 	 div 	 es 	 	for	26	 year 	 s 	 	now	.
So	,	that	's	home	 re 	 ally 	 	.
The	 Mal 	 div 	 es 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	I	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	you	're	aware	,	are	a	chain	of	 is 	 land 	 s 	 	off	the	 south 	 west 	 	coast	of	India	here	.
 Cap 	 ital 	 	,	 Mal 	 é 	 	,	where	I	live	.
 Actu 	 ally 	 	,	 s 	 itt 	 ing 	 	here	 to 	 day 	 	in	 My 	 sore 	 	,	we	're	 close 	 r 	 	to	 Mal 	 é 	 	than	we	are	to	 Del 	 hi 	 	,	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	.
If	you	're	in	IT	,	India	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	,	is	the	place	to	be	at	the	moment	.
But	if	you	're	a	marine	biologist	,	 Mal 	 div 	 es 	 	is	not	 s 	 uch 	 	a	bad	place	to	be	.
And	it	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 en 	 	my	home	these	 year 	 s 	 	.
For	 t 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	've	 be 	 en 	 	there	,	fantastic	coral	 reef 	 s 	 	,	fantastic	 div 	 ing 	 	,	fantastic	 snorkel 	 ing 	 	.
I	 s 	 pend 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	of	my	time	 a 	 s 	 	possible	 invest 	 ig 	 ating 	 	the	marine	life	.
I	 stud 	 y 	 	fish	,	 al 	 so 	 	the	 big 	 ger 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 whale 	 s 	 	and	 dolphin 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	blue	whale	.	We	have	blue	 whale 	 s 	 	in	the	 water 	 s 	 	around	here	,	off	 Mal 	 div 	 es 	 	,	around	the	 water 	 s 	 	of	India	.	You	can	see	them	off	 Ker 	 ala 	 	.
And	,	in	fact	,	we	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 luck 	 y 	 	in	 th 	 is 	 	region	.
One	of	the	best	 place 	 s 	 	in	the	world	to	see	blue	 whale 	 s 	 	is	here	in	 th 	 is 	 	region	.
In	 S 	 ri 	 	Lanka	,	if	you	go	down	to	the	south	coast	of	 S 	 ri 	 	Lanka	,	 dur 	 ing 	 	the	 north 	 east 	 	monsoon	season	,	you	can	see	blue	 whale 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	,	 ver 	 y 	 	 eas 	 ily 	 	.
It	's	 prob 	 ably 	 	the	best	place	in	the	world	to	see	them	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	when	I	talk	about	the	 north 	 east 	 	monsoon	season	,	I	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	 man 	 y 	 	of	you	here	know	 exact 	 ly 	 	what	I	mean	,	but	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	some	of	you	are	not	 quit 	 e 	 	so	 s 	 ure 	 	.
I	need	to	explain	a	little	bit	about	 monsoon 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	monsoon	,	the	root	of	the	word	``	monsoon	''	 come 	 s 	 	from	the	word	``	season	.	''
So	,	it	's	just	a	season	.	And	there	are	two	 season 	 s 	 	in	most	of	South	Asia	.
And	in	the	summer	India	 heat 	 s 	 	up	,	 get 	 s 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	hot	.
 Ho 	 t 	 	air	 rise 	 s 	 	,	and	air	is	drawn	in	off	the	sea	to	replace	it	.
And	the	way	it	 work 	 s 	 	is	,	it	 come 	 s 	 	from	the	 south 	 west 	 	.
It	 come 	 s 	 	off	the	ocean	here	and	is	drawn	up	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	India	.
So	it	 come 	 s 	 	from	the	 south 	 west 	 	.	It	's	a	 south 	 west 	 	monsoon	.
 Pick 	 s 	 	up	 moist 	 ure 	 	 a 	 s 	 	it	 cross 	 es 	 	the	ocean	.
That	's	what	 br 	 ing 	 s 	 	the	monsoon	rain	.
And	then	in	the	winter	 thing 	 s 	 	cool	down	.
High	pressure	 build 	 s 	 	over	India	.
And	the	whole	system	 go 	 es 	 	 in 	 to 	 	reverse	.
So	,	the	wind	is	now	coming	from	the	 north 	 east 	 	out	of	India	,	 a 	 cross 	 	the	Indian	Ocean	,	 th 	 is 	 	way	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 Afri 	 ca 	 	.
Keep	that	in	mind	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	I	'm	a	marine	biologist	,	but	I	'm	 actual 	 ly 	 	a	bit	of	an	old	 fashion 	 ed 	 	 natural 	 ist 	 	,	I	suppose	.
I	'm	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	all	 sort 	 s 	 	of	 thing 	 s 	 	,	 al 	 most 	 	 every 	 thing 	 	that	 move 	 s 	 	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	 dragon 	 flies 	 	.	And	I	'm	 actual 	 ly 	 	going	to	talk	,	 th 	 is 	 	afternoon	,	about	 dragon 	 flies 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	species	,	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	Oriental	Scarlet	.
And	one	thing	you	need	to	know	about	 dragon 	 flies 	 	,	one	 import 	 ant 	 	thing	,	is	that	they	lay	 the 	 ir 	 	 egg 	 s 	 	in	fresh	water	.
 The 	 y 	 	need	fresh	water	to	breed	.
 The 	 y 	 	lay	the	 egg 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	fresh	water	.
 Li 	 ttle 	 	 larva 	 e 	 	hatch	out	in	fresh	water	.
 The 	 y 	 	feed	on	other	little	 thing 	 s 	 	.	 The 	 y 	 	feed	on	mosquito	 larva 	 e 	 	.
So	,	they	're	 ver 	 y 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	control	mosquito	 larva 	 e 	 	,	among	other	 thing 	 s 	 	.
And	they	grow	and	grow	by	 stage 	 s 	 	.	And	they	climb	out	of	the	water	,	burst	out	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	adult	which	we	see	.
And	 typical 	 ly 	 	,	there	is	a	lot	of	 vari 	 ation 	 	,	but	if	you	have	a	 dragon 	 fly 	 	with	,	say	,	a	one	year	life	cycle	,	which	is	 quit 	 e 	 	typical	,	the	larva	,	living	in	the	fresh	water	,	 live 	 s 	 	for	10	or	11	 month 	 s 	 	.
And	then	the	adult	,	which	 come 	 s 	 	after	,	 live 	 s 	 	for	one	or	two	 month 	 s 	 	.
So	it	's	 essential 	 ly 	 	a	 fresh 	 water 	 	animal	.
It	 re 	 ally 	 	 do 	 es 	 	need	fresh	water	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	the	 part 	 icular 	 	species	of	 dragon 	 fly 	 	I	want	to	talk	about	is	 th 	 is 	 	one	,	 be 	 cause 	 	most	 dragon 	 flies 	 	,	like	the	one	we	've	just	 s 	 een 	 	,	when	the	adult	is	there	for	 it 	 s 	 	brief	one	or	two	 month 	 s 	 	of	life	,	it	 do 	 es 	 	n't	go	 ver 	 y 	 	far	.	It	ca	n't	travel	 ver 	 y 	 	far	.
A	few	 kilometer 	 s 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	,	is	 quit 	 e 	 	typical	.
 The 	 y 	 	are	 ver 	 y 	 	good	 fli 	 ers 	 	,	but	they	do	n't	go	too	far	.
But	 th 	 is 	 	guy	is	an	exception	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	is	 call 	 ed 	 	the	 Glo 	 be 	 	 Ski 	 mmer 	 	,	or	 Wa 	 nder 	 ing 	 	 G 	 lider 	 	.
And	,	 a 	 s 	 	the	name	might	suggest	,	it	is	found	 pre 	 tty 	 	much	around	the	world	.
It	 live 	 s 	 	 through 	 out 	 	the	 tropic 	 s 	 	,	the	 America 	 s 	 	,	 Afri 	 ca 	 	,	Asia	,	Australia	,	 in 	 to 	 	the	Pacific	.
And	it	 wander 	 s 	 	far	and	wide	.	We	know	that	much	about	it	.
But	it	 re 	 ally 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	n't	 be 	 en 	 	 stud 	 ied 	 	 ver 	 y 	 	much	.
It	's	a	 ra 	 ther 	 	 mediocr 	 e 	 	looking	 dragon 	 fly 	 	.
If	you	're	going	to	 stud 	 y 	 	 dragon 	 flies 	 	,	you	want	to	 stud 	 y 	 	 t 	 hose 	 	 re 	 ally 	 	bright	 beaut 	 iful 	 	 one 	 s 	 	,	like	that	red	one	.	Or	the	 re 	 ally 	 	rare	 one 	 s 	 	,	the	 en 	 demic 	 	 en 	 danger 	 ed 	 	 one 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	,	it	 seem 	 s 	 	a	bit	dull	you	know	.
It	's	sort	of	 dull 	 - 	 color 	 ed 	 	.	And	it	's	 fair 	 ly 	 	common	.
And	it	 occur 	 s 	 	 every 	 where 	 	--	you	know	,	why	 both 	 er 	 	?
But	if	you	take	that	attitude	,	you	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 mis 	 s 	 ing 	 	 some 	 thing 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	special	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	 th 	 is 	 	 dragon 	 fly 	 	 ha 	 s 	 	a	 ra 	 ther 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	story	to	tell	.
And	I	feel	 ver 	 y 	 	 privilege 	 d 	 	to	have	 s 	 tumble 	 d 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	it	living	in	the	 Mal 	 div 	 es 	 	.
When	I	first	went	to	the	 Mal 	 div 	 es 	 	,	dead	keen	on	 div 	 ing 	 	,	 s 	 pent 	 	 a 	 s 	 	much	of	my	time	 a 	 s 	 	I	could	in	and	under	the	water	.
Did	n't	notice	any	 dragon 	 flies 	 	;	 may 	 be 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	there	,	 may 	 be 	 	they	 we 	 re 	 	n't	.
Did	n't	notice	them	.
But	after	some	time	,	after	some	 month 	 s 	 	,	one	day	 a 	 s 	 	I	was	going	out	and	about	,	 sudden 	 ly 	 	I	 notice 	 d 	 	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 dragon 	 flies 	 	,	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	 dragon 	 flies 	 	.
 Some 	 thing 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	,	these	are	all	 th 	 is 	 	species	 Glo 	 be 	 	 Ski 	 mmer 	 	.
I	did	n't	know	at	the	time	,	but	I	know	now	,	they	're	 Glo 	 be 	 	 Sk 	 immers 	 	,	 hundred 	 s 	 	of	them	.
And	they	 we 	 re 	 	there	for	some	time	.	And	then	they	 we 	 re 	 	gone	.
And	I	did	n't	think	 any 	 thing 	 	more	of	it	 un 	 til 	 	the	 follow 	 ing 	 	year	,	when	it	 happen 	 ed 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	,	and	then	the	year	after	that	,	and	then	the	year	after	that	.
And	I	was	a	bit	 s 	 low 	 	,	I	did	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	take	too	much	notice	.
But	I	 ask 	 ed 	 	some	 Mal 	 div 	 ian 	 	 friend 	 s 	 	and	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	,	and	 y 	 es 	 	they	come	every	year	.
And	I	 ask 	 ed 	 	people	about	them	and	 y 	 es 	 	,	they	 k 	 new 	 	,	but	they	did	n't	know	 any 	 thing 	 	,	where	they	came	from	,	or	 any 	 thing 	 	.
And	 aga 	 in 	 	I	did	n't	think	too	much	of	it	.
But	 s 	 low 	 ly 	 	it	 beg 	 an 	 	to	dawn	on	me	that	 some 	 thing 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	special	was	 happen 	 ing 	 	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	 dragon 	 flies 	 	need	fresh	water	to	breed	.
And	the	 Mal 	 div 	 es 	 	,	and	I	'm	 s 	 ure 	 	some	of	you	have	 be 	 en 	 	there	--	so	here	is	home	.
So	,	 Mal 	 div 	 es 	 	,	 beaut 	 iful 	 	place	.
It	's	built	 entire 	 ly 	 	of	coral	 reef 	 s 	 	.
And	on	top	of	the	coral	 reef 	 s 	 	are	sand	 bank 	 s 	 	.
 Ave 	 rage 	 	height	,	about	that	much	above	sea	level	.
So	,	global	 warm 	 ing 	 	,	sea	level	rise	,	it	's	a	real	serious	issue	.
But	I	'm	not	going	to	talk	about	that	.
 An 	 other 	 	 import 	 ant 	 	point	of	these	sand	 bank 	 s 	 	is	that	when	it	 rain 	 s 	 	,	the	 rain 	 water 	 	 soak 	 s 	 	down	 in 	 to 	 	the	 s 	 oil 	 	.	So	,	it	's	gone	.
So	,	it	 stay 	 s 	 	under	the	 s 	 oil 	 	.
The	 tree 	 s 	 	can	put	 the 	 ir 	 	 root 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	it	.
 Human 	 s 	 	can	dig	 hole 	 s 	 	and	make	a	well	.
But	 dragon 	 flies 	 	--	a	bit	 trick 	 y 	 	.
There	is	no	surface	fresh	water	.
There	are	no	 pond 	 s 	 	,	 stream 	 s 	 	,	 river 	 s 	 	,	 lake 	 s 	 	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	like	that	.
So	,	why	is	it	that	every	year	 million 	 s 	 	of	 dragon 	 flies 	 	,	 million 	 s 	 	,	 million 	 s 	 	of	 dragon 	 flies 	 	turn	up	?
I	got	a	little	bit	 cur 	 ious 	 	.	In	fact	I	'll	stop	here	,	 be 	 cause 	 	I	want	to	ask	,	and	there	is	a	lot	of	people	who	,	from	India	of	course	,	people	who	grew	up	 s 	 pend 	 ing 	 	your	 child 	 hood 	 	here	.
 T 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	are	Indian	or	 s 	 pent 	 	your	 child 	 hood 	 	here	,	let	me	have	a	show	of	 hand 	 s 	 	,	who	of	you	--	not	yet	,	not	yet	!
You	're	too	keen	.	You	're	too	keen	.	No	.	Hang	on	.	Hang	on	.
Wait	for	the	go	.	I	'll	say	go	.
 T 	 hose 	 	of	you	who	grew	up	in	India	,	do	you	remember	in	your	 child 	 hood 	 	,	 dragon 	 flies 	 	,	 s 	 warm 	 s 	 	of	 dragon 	 flies 	 	?	 May 	 be 	 	at	school	,	 may 	 be 	 	 ty 	 ing 	 	little	bits	of	string	onto	them	?
 May 	 be 	 	 pull 	 ing 	 	bits	off	?	I	'm	not	 ask 	 ing 	 	about	that	.
You	've	 on 	 ly 	 	got	to	say	,	do	you	remember	 see 	 ing 	 	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 dragon 	 flies 	 	.
Any	 hand 	 s 	 	?	Any	 hand 	 s 	 	?	Yes	.	Thank	you	.	Thank	you	.
It	's	a	 wide 	 spread 	 	 phenomen 	 on 	 	 through 	 out 	 	South	Asia	,	 in 	 clud 	 ing 	 	the	 Mal 	 div 	 es 	 	.
And	I	got	a	bit	 cur 	 ious 	 	about	it	.
In	the	 Mal 	 div 	 es 	 	--	now	,	in	India	there	is	 ple 	 n 	 ty 	 	of	water	,	so	,	 dragon 	 flies 	 	,	 yea 	 h 	 	,	of	course	.	Why	not	?
But	in	 Mal 	 div 	 es 	 	,	no	fresh	water	.	So	,	what	on	Earth	is	going	on	?
And	the	first	thing	I	did	was	 start 	 ed 	 	 record 	 ing 	 	when	they	 turn 	 ed 	 	up	in	the	 Mal 	 div 	 es 	 	.
And	there	is	the	answer	,	21st	of	 Oct 	 ob 	 er 	 	.
Not	every	year	,	that	's	the	average	date	.
So	,	I	've	 be 	 en 	 	writing	it	down	for	15	 year 	 s 	 	now	.
You	'd	think	they	're	coming	from	India	.	It	's	the	 close 	 st 	 	place	.
But	in	 Oct 	 ob 	 er 	 	,	remember	,	we	're	still	in	 south 	 west 	 	monsoon	,	 Mal 	 div 	 es 	 	is	still	in	the	 south 	 west 	 	monsoon	.
But	wind	is	,	 in 	 vari 	 ably 	 	,	every	time	,	is	from	the	west	.
It	's	going	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	India	,	not	from	India	.
So	,	are	these	 thing 	 s 	 	,	how	are	these	 thing 	 s 	 	 get 	 ting 	 	here	?
 A 	 re 	 	they	coming	from	India	against	the	wind	?
 See 	 med 	 	a	bit	 un 	 like 	 ly 	 	.
So	,	next	thing	I	did	is	I	got	on	the	phone	.
 Mal 	 div 	 es 	 	is	a	long	 arch 	 ipelago 	 	.
It	 stretch 	 es 	 	about	500	 mile 	 s 	 	,	of	course	it	's	India	here	.
I	got	on	the	phone	and	 email 	 ed 	 	to	 friend 	 s 	 	and	 col 	 league 	 s 	 	.
When	do	you	see	the	 dragon 	 flies 	 	appear	?
And	 pre 	 tty 	 	soon	,	a	picture	 start 	 ed 	 	 em 	 er 	 ging 	 	.
In	 Bang 	 al 	 ore 	 	,	a	 col 	 league 	 	there	 s 	 ent 	 	me	information	for	three	 year 	 s 	 	,	average	,	24th	of	September	,	so	late	September	.
Down	in	 Tri 	 van 	 drum 	 	,	a	bit	 lat 	 er 	 	.
Far	north	of	 Mal 	 div 	 es 	 	,	a	bit	 lat 	 er 	 	.
 Th 	 en 	 	 Mal 	 é 	 	,	then	further	south	.
And	then	the	 southern 	 most 	 	 Mal 	 div 	 es 	 	.
It	's	 pre 	 tty 	 	obvious	,	they	're	coming	from	India	.
But	they	are	coming	400	 mile 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	ocean	,	against	the	wind	.
How	on	Earth	are	they	 do 	 ing 	 	that	?
I	did	n't	know	.
The	next	thing	I	did	was	I	 start 	 ed 	 	 count 	 ing 	 	 dragon 	 flies 	 	.
I	 want 	 ed 	 	to	know	about	 the 	 ir 	 	 season 	 ality 	 	,	what	time	of	year	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	when	they	first	 arriv 	 e 	 	,	but	how	long	are	they	around	for	?	 Do 	 es 	 	that	give	any	 clue 	 s 	 	?
So	,	I	 start 	 ed 	 	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 rigor 	 ous 	 	scientific	process	.
I	had	a	 rigor 	 ous 	 	scientific	 trans 	 ect 	 	.
I	got	on	my	 bi 	 cycle 	 	,	and	I	 cycle 	 d 	 	around	the	 is 	 land 	 	of	 Mal 	 é 	 	.
It	's	about	five	 kilometer 	 s 	 	around	,	 count 	 ing 	 	the	 dragon 	 flies 	 	 a 	 s 	 	I	go	,	 try 	 ing 	 	not	to	bump	 in 	 to 	 	people	 a 	 s 	 	I	'm	looking	in	the	 tree 	 s 	 	.
And	they	're	here	for	a	 ver 	 y 	 	short	time	,	 Oct 	 ob 	 er 	 	,	 Nove 	 mb 	 er 	 	,	 De 	 c 	 emb 	 er 	 	.	That	's	it	.
And	then	they	tail	off	,	there	's	a	few	,	but	that	's	it	.
 Oct 	 ob 	 er 	 	,	 Nove 	 mb 	 er 	 	,	 De 	 c 	 emb 	 er 	 	.	That	is	not	the	 north 	 east 	 	monsoon	season	.
That	's	not	the	 south 	 west 	 	season	.
That	's	the	 inter 	 - 	 monsoon 	 	,	the	time	when	the	monsoon	 change 	 s 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	what	I	 s 	 aid 	 	was	,	you	get	the	 south 	 west 	 	monsoon	going	one	way	,	and	then	it	 change 	 s 	 	and	you	get	the	 north 	 east 	 	monsoon	going	the	other	way	.
And	that	sort	of	 give 	 s 	 	the	impression	you	've	got	one	air	mass	going	up	and	down	,	up	and	down	.	It	 do 	 es 	 	n't	work	like	that	.
What	 happen 	 s 	 	,	 actual 	 ly 	 	,	is	there	is	two	air	 masse 	 s 	 	.
And	there	is	a	front	between	them	,	and	the	front	 move 	 s 	 	.
So	,	if	you	've	got	India	here	,	when	the	front	is	up	above	India	you	're	 in 	 to 	 	the	 south 	 west 	 	monsoon	.
 Th 	 en 	 	the	front	 move 	 s 	 	 in 	 to 	 	the	 north 	 east 	 	monsoon	.
And	that	front	in	the	middle	is	not	 vert 	 ical 	 	,	it	's	at	an	angle	.
So	,	 a 	 s 	 	it	 come 	 s 	 	over	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	 Mal 	 é 	 	I	'm	 stand 	 ing 	 	in	 Mal 	 é 	 	 under 	 neath 	 	the	front	.
I	can	be	in	the	 south 	 west 	 	monsoon	.
But	the	wind	above	is	from	the	 north 	 east 	 	monsoon	.
So	,	the	 dragon 	 flies 	 	are	 actual 	 ly 	 	coming	from	India	on	the	 north 	 east 	 	monsoon	,	but	at	an	altitude	at	1,000	to	2,000	 meter 	 s 	 	up	in	the	air	.	 In 	 credible 	 	.
 Th 	 ese 	 	little	 insect 	 s 	 	,	it	's	the	same	 one 	 s 	 	we	see	out	here	[	in	India	]	,	two	 inch 	 es 	 	long	,	five	 centimeter 	 s 	 	long	,	 fly 	 ing 	 	in	 the 	 ir 	 	 million 	 s 	 	,	400	 mile 	 s 	 	 a 	 cross 	 	the	ocean	,	at	2,000	 meter 	 s 	 	up	.	 Qui 	 te 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	.
So	,	I	was	 quit 	 e 	 	 pleas 	 ed 	 	with	 my 	 self 	 	.	I	thought	 w 	 ow 	 	,	I	've	 track 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	one	,	I	know	how	they	come	here	.	 Th 	 en 	 	I	 scratch 	 ed 	 	my	head	a	bit	,	and	that	's	 ok 	 a 	 y 	 	,	I	know	how	they	come	here	,	but	why	do	they	come	here	?
What	are	 million 	 s 	 	of	 dragon 	 flies 	 	 do 	 ing 	 	,	 fly 	 ing 	 	out	over	the	ocean	every	year	to	 the 	 ir 	 	 ap 	 parent 	 	doom	?
It	 do 	 es 	 	n't	make	sense	.	There	is	 noth 	 ing 	 	for	them	in	 Mal 	 div 	 es 	 	.
What	on	Earth	are	they	 do 	 ing 	 	?
Well	,	to	cut	a	long	story	short	,	they	're	 actual 	 ly 	 	 fly 	 ing 	 	right	 a 	 cross 	 	the	ocean	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	making	it	all	the	way	 a 	 cross 	 	to	East	 Afri 	 ca 	 	.
I	know	that	 be 	 cause 	 	I	have	 friend 	 s 	 	who	work	on	 fish 	 eries 	 	'	research	 vessel 	 s 	 	who	have	 s 	 ent 	 	to	me	 report 	 s 	 	from	 boat 	 s 	 	out	in	the	ocean	.
I	know	 be 	 cause 	 	we	have	 report 	 s 	 	from	 Se 	 y 	 chel 	 les 	 	,	which	fit	in	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	down	here	.
And	I	know	 be 	 cause 	 	when	you	look	at	the	 rain 	 fall 	 	,	these	 part 	 icular 	 	 insect 	 s 	 	,	these	 Glo 	 be 	 	 Sk 	 immers 	 	breed	in	 tempor 	 ary 	 	rain	water	 pool 	 s 	 	.
 Oka 	 y 	 	,	they	lay	 the 	 ir 	 	 egg 	 s 	 	where	the	 season 	 al 	 	 rain 	 s 	 	are	,	the	monsoon	 rain 	 s 	 	.
The	 larva 	 e 	 	have	to	develop	 ver 	 y 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	take	six	 week 	 s 	 	.	 In 	 stead 	 	of	11	 month 	 s 	 	,	they	're	six	 week 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	up	,	and	they	're	off	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	here	we	have	,	in	case	you	ca	n't	read	at	the	back	,	the	top	is	 rain 	 fall 	 	for	India	.
And	we	're	 start 	 ing 	 	in	 Ju 	 ne 	 	.	So	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	monsoon	rain	.
By	September	,	 Oct 	 ob 	 er 	 	,	it	's	 dry 	 ing 	 	out	.
 No 	 thing 	 	for	these	 dragon 	 flies 	 	.	There	is	no	more	 season 	 al 	 	rain	.
 The 	 y 	 	've	got	to	go	 hunt 	 ing 	 	for	 season 	 al 	 	rain	.
And	they	fly	south	.	 A 	 s 	 	the	monsoon	 withdraw 	 s 	 	to	the	south	they	come	down	through	 Kar 	 nataka 	 	,	 in 	 to 	 	 Ker 	 ala 	 	.
And	then	they	run	out	of	land	.
But	they	are	 inc 	 red 	 ibly 	 	good	 fli 	 ers 	 	.	 Th 	 is 	 	 part 	 icular 	 	species	,	it	can	fly	for	 thousand 	 s 	 	of	 kilometer 	 s 	 	.
And	it	just	 keep 	 s 	 	going	.	And	the	wind	,	the	 north 	 east 	 	wind	 s 	 woosh 	 es 	 	it	around	and	 car 	 ries 	 	it	off	 a 	 cross 	 	the	ocean	to	 Afri 	 ca 	 	,	where	it	's	 rain 	 ing 	 	.
And	they	are	 breed 	 ing 	 	in	the	 rain 	 s 	 	of	 Afri 	 ca 	 	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	 south 	 east 	 	 Afri 	 ca 	 	.	It	 make 	 s 	 	it	look	like	there	are	sort	of	two	 breed 	 ing 	 	 period 	 s 	 	here	.	It	's	 s 	 light 	 ly 	 	more	 complic 	 ated 	 	than	that	.
What	's	 happen 	 ing 	 	is	they	are	 breed 	 ing 	 	in	the	monsoon	 rain 	 s 	 	here	.
And	the	 dragon 	 flies 	 	you	can	see	 to 	 day 	 	 out 	 side 	 	here	,	on	the	campus	,	are	the	young	of	 th 	 is 	 	generation	.
 The 	 y 	 	 hatch 	 ed 	 	out	in	India	.
 The 	 y 	 	're	looking	for	 some 	 where 	 	to	breed	.	If	it	 rain 	 s 	 	here	they	'll	breed	.
But	most	of	them	are	going	to	carry	on	.	And	next	stop	,	 per 	 hap 	 s 	 	 on 	 ly 	 	four	or	five	 day 	 s 	 	away	is	going	to	be	East	 Afri 	 ca 	 	.
The	wind	will	 s 	 woosh 	 	them	out	 a 	 cross 	 	here	.
If	they	pass	the	 Mal 	 div 	 es 	 	they	might	go	and	have	a	look	,	 noth 	 ing 	 	there	,	they	'll	carry	on	.
 He 	 re 	 	,	here	,	Kenya	,	East	 Afri 	 ca 	 	,	they	've	 actual 	 ly 	 	just	come	out	of	a	long	drought	.
Just	last	week	the	 rain 	 s 	 	broke	.	The	short	 rain 	 s 	 	broke	and	it	's	 rain 	 ing 	 	there	now	.
And	the	 dragon 	 flies 	 	are	there	.	I	have	 report 	 s 	 	from	my	 vari 	 ous 	 	 contact 	 s 	 	.
The	 dragon 	 flies 	 	are	here	now	.	 The 	 y 	 	're	 breed 	 ing 	 	there	.
When	 t 	 hose 	 	 guy 	 s 	 	,	they	'll	lay	 the 	 ir 	 	 egg 	 s 	 	now	.
 The 	 y 	 	'll	hatch	out	in	six	 week 	 s 	 	.	By	that	time	the	 season 	 al 	 	 rain 	 s 	 	have	 move 	 d 	 	on	.	It	's	not	there	,	it	's	down	here	.
 The 	 y 	 	'll	fly	down	here	.	And	the	clever	thing	is	the	wind	is	 al 	 ways 	 	 converg 	 ing 	 	to	where	the	rain	is	.
The	rain	 occur 	 s 	 	,	these	are	summer	 rain 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	summer	monsoon	.
The	 s 	 un 	 	is	 over 	 head 	 	there	.	 Summ 	 er 	 	 rain 	 s 	 	in	southern	 Afri 	 ca 	 	.
The	 s 	 un 	 	is	 over 	 head 	 	,	 maxim 	 um 	 	 heat 	 ing 	 	,	 maxim 	 um 	 	 evapo 	 ration 	 	,	 maxim 	 um 	 	 cloud 	 s 	 	,	 maxim 	 um 	 	 rain 	 fall 	 	,	 maxim 	 um 	 	 opport 	 un 	 ities 	 	for	 re 	 production 	 	.
Not	 on 	 ly 	 	that	,	 be 	 cause 	 	you	have	 th 	 is 	 	 con 	 ve 	 ction 	 	,	you	have	 th 	 is 	 	 ris 	 ing 	 	of	the	air	where	it	's	hot	,	air	is	drawn	in	.
There	's	a	 converg 	 ence 	 	.	So	,	 where 	 ver 	 	the	rain	is	 fall 	 ing 	 	,	the	air	is	drawn	 to 	 ward 	 s 	 	it	to	replace	the	air	that	's	 ris 	 ing 	 	.
So	,	the	little	fellow	that	 hatch 	 es 	 	out	here	,	he	 get 	 s 	 	up	 in 	 to 	 	the	air	,	he	is	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	carried	to	where	the	rain	is	 fall 	 ing 	 	.
Lay	 the 	 ir 	 	 egg 	 s 	 	,	next	generation	,	they	come	up	,	 autom 	 at 	 ically 	 	carried	to	where	the	rain	is	 fall 	 ing 	 	.
It	's	now	back	there	.	 The 	 y 	 	come	out	,	it	's	time	to	come	back	.
So	,	in	four	 generation 	 s 	 	,	one	,	two	,	three	,	four	and	then	back	.
A	complete	circuit	of	the	Indian	Ocean	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	circuit	of	about	16,000	 kilometer 	 s 	 	.
16,000	 kilometer 	 s 	 	,	four	 generation 	 s 	 	,	mind	you	,	for	a	two	inch	long	insect	.	It	's	 quit 	 e 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	.
 T 	 hose 	 	of	you	from	North	America	will	be	familiar	with	the	 Mon 	 arch 	 	 butter 	 fly 	 	.
 Whi 	 ch 	 	,	up	 un 	 til 	 	now	 ha 	 s 	 	had	the	 long 	 est 	 	known	insect	 migr 	 ation 	 	.
It	's	 on 	 ly 	 	half	the	length	of	 th 	 is 	 	one	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	 cross 	 ing 	 	here	,	of	the	ocean	,	is	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 tru 	 ly 	 	regular	 trans 	 ocean 	 ic 	 	 cross 	 ing 	 	of	any	insect	.
A	 quit 	 e 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	feat	.
And	I	 on 	 ly 	 	 s 	 tumble 	 d 	 	on	 th 	 is 	 	 be 	 cause 	 	I	was	living	in	 Mal 	 é 	 	,	in	 Mal 	 div 	 es 	 	for	long	 en 	 ough 	 	for	it	to	 per 	 col 	 ate 	 	 in 	 to 	 	my	brain	that	 some 	 thing 	 	 ra 	 ther 	 	special	was	going	on	.
But	 dragon 	 flies 	 	are	not	the	 on 	 ly 	 	 creature 	 s 	 	that	make	the	 cross 	 ing 	 	.
There	is	more	to	the	story	.
I	'm	 al 	 so 	 	 interest 	 ed 	 	in	 bird 	 s 	 	.	And	I	'm	familiar	with	 th 	 is 	 	fellow	.	 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	 ra 	 ther 	 	special	bird	.
It	's	a	falcon	.	It	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	eastern	 red 	 - 	 foot 	 ed 	 	falcon	,	 obvious 	 ly 	 	.
But	it	's	 al 	 so 	 	 call 	 ed 	 	the	Amur	Falcon	.
And	it	's	 call 	 ed 	 	the	Amur	Falcon	 be 	 cause 	 	it	 breed 	 s 	 	in	 Amur 	 land 	 	.
 Whi 	 ch 	 	is	an	area	 a 	 long 	 	the	Amur	River	,	which	is	up	here	.
It	's	the	border	,	much	of	it	is	the	border	between	China	and	Russia	,	up	here	in	the	far	east	.
So	,	Siberia	,	 Man 	 chu 	 ria 	 	.
And	that	's	where	it	 breed 	 s 	 	.
And	if	you	're	a	falcon	it	's	 quit 	 e 	 	a	nice	place	to	be	in	the	summer	.
But	it	's	a	 pre 	 tty 	 	 mis 	 er 	 able 	 	place	to	be	in	the	winter	.
It	's	,	well	,	you	can	imagine	.
So	,	 a 	 s 	 	any	 sens 	 ible 	 	bird	would	do	,	he	 move 	 s 	 	south	.	 The 	 y 	 	move	south	.	The	whole	population	 move 	 s 	 	south	.
But	then	the	 be 	 ing 	 	 sens 	 ible 	 	 stop 	 ped 	 	.
So	,	now	they	do	n't	stop	here	,	or	even	down	here	.
No	,	they	turn	 a 	 cross 	 	here	.
 The 	 y 	 	have	a	little	 re 	 fuel 	 ing 	 	stop	in	 north 	 eastern 	 	India	.
 The 	 y 	 	come	to	the	latitude	of	about	Mumbai	or	 Go 	 a 	 	.
And	then	they	strike	out	 a 	 cross 	 	the	ocean	,	down	to	Kenya	.
And	down	here	,	and	they	winter	down	here	[	in	southern	 Afri 	 ca 	 	]	.
 In 	 credible 	 	.	 Th 	 is 	 	is	the	most	 extra 	 ordin 	 ary 	 	 migr 	 ation 	 	of	any	bird	of	 pre 	 y 	 	.	A	 quit 	 e 	 	 in 	 credible 	 	 migr 	 ation 	 	.
And	they	are	not	the	 on 	 ly 	 	one	that	 make 	 s 	 	the	 cross 	 ing 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	have	the	most	 in 	 credible 	 	journey	,	but	 s 	 ever 	 al 	 	make	the	 cross 	 ing 	 	from	India	to	 Afri 	 ca 	 	.	 Inc 	 lude 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	one	,	the	hobby	.
 Th 	 is 	 	fellow	is	a	 ver 	 y 	 	nice	bird	,	 th 	 is 	 	is	the	 Pi 	 ed 	 	cuckoo	.
 T 	 hose 	 	of	you	from	 north 	 ern 	 	India	will	be	familiar	with	 th 	 is 	 	.
It	 come 	 s 	 	with	the	 monsoon 	 s 	 	.
 Th 	 is 	 	time	of	year	they	cross	back	to	 Afri 	 ca 	 	.
And	 th 	 is 	 	guy	,	the	roller	,	a	 ra 	 ther 	 	 beaut 	 iful 	 	bird	.
It	's	known	 a 	 s 	 	the	 Eurasia 	 n 	 	 Roll 	 er 	 	.	In	India	it	 occur 	 s 	 	in	the	 north 	 west 	 	,	so	it	's	known	 a 	 s 	 	the	Kashmir	 Roll 	 er 	 	.
And	these	 bird 	 s 	 	,	what	I	've	 d 	 one 	 	is	I	've	 com 	 plied 	 	all	the	 record 	 s 	 	,	all	the	 avail 	 able 	 	 record 	 s 	 	of	these	 bird 	 s 	 	,	put	them	together	,	and	found	out	they	 migr 	 ate 	 	at	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	time	 a 	 s 	 	the	 dragon 	 flies 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	make	use	of	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	 wind 	 s 	 	.
 The 	 y 	 	travel	at	 exact 	 ly 	 	the	same	time	with	the	same	 wind 	 s 	 	to	make	the	 cross 	 ing 	 	.	I	know	they	travel	at	the	same	altitude	.
It	's	known	about	the	Amur	Falcon	.	 Th 	 is 	 	guy	,	 un 	 fortunate 	 ly 	 	,	one	of	these	met	an	 un 	 fortunate 	 	end	.
He	was	 fly 	 ing 	 	off	the	coast	of	 Go 	 a 	 	,	21	 year 	 s 	 	ago	,	1988	.	 Oct 	 ob 	 er 	 	,	1988	.
An	Indian	 Na 	 vy 	 	jet	was	 fly 	 ing 	 	off	 Go 	 a 	 	,	bang	!	In	the	middle	of	the	night	.	 Fort 	 un 	 ate 	 ly 	 	,	a	two	engine	jet	got	back	to	base	,	and	they	 pull 	 ed 	 	the	 remain 	 s 	 	of	one	of	these	[	 Eurasia 	 n 	 	 Roll 	 ers 	 	]	out	.
 F 	 ly 	 ing 	 	at	night	over	the	Indian	Ocean	2,424	 meter 	 s 	 	.
 Sam 	 e 	 	height	 a 	 s 	 	the	 dragon 	 flies 	 	go	.
So	,	they	are	using	the	same	 wind 	 s 	 	.
And	the	other	thing	,	the	other	 import 	 ant 	 	factor	for	all	these	 bird 	 s 	 	,	all	medium	sized	 fellow 	 s 	 	,	and	 th 	 is 	 	 include 	 s 	 	the	next	slide	 a 	 s 	 	well	,	which	is	a	 bee 	 - 	 eater 	 	.

It	's	a	 Blue 	 - 	 cheek 	 ed 	 	 Bee 	 - 	 eater 	 	.

It	is	 re 	 ally 	 	a	sacred	space	.
And	one	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	that	is	 re 	 ally 	 	sacred	about	it	is	that	you	have	no	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	to	think	about	the	future	,	or	the	past	.
You	 re 	 ally 	 	are	 al 	 ive 	 	right	here	in	 th 	 is 	 	moment	.
There	are	so	 man 	 y 	 	 decision 	 s 	 	 be 	 ing 	 	made	when	you	walk	on	the	 band 	 stand 	 	.
We	had	no	idea	what	key	we	 we 	 re 	 	going	to	play	in	.
In	the	middle	,	we	sort	of	made	our	way	 in 	 to 	 	a	song	 call 	 ed 	 	``	 T 	 iti 	 	Boom	.	''
But	that	could	have	 happen 	 ed 	 	--	 may 	 be 	 	,	 may 	 be 	 	not	.
 Every 	 one 	 	's	 listen 	 ing 	 	.	We	're	 respond 	 ing 	 	.
You	have	no	time	for	 project 	 ed 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	.
So	the	idea	of	a	 mistak 	 e 	 	:	From	the	 per 	 spect 	 ive 	 	of	a	jazz	 music 	 ian 	 	,	it	's	 eas 	 ier 	 	to	talk	about	 some 	 one 	 	else	's	 mistak 	 e 	 	.
So	the	way	I	perceive	a	 mistak 	 e 	 	when	I	'm	on	the	 band 	 stand 	 	--	first	of	all	,	we	do	n't	 re 	 ally 	 	see	it	 a 	 s 	 	a	 mistak 	 e 	 	.
The	 on 	 ly 	 	 mistak 	 e 	 	lies	in	that	I	'm	not	able	to	perceive	what	it	is	that	 some 	 one 	 	else	did	.
Every	``	 mistak 	 e 	 	''	is	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	in	jazz	.
So	it	's	hard	to	even	 de 	 scribe 	 	what	a	funny	note	would	be	.
So	for	 ex 	 ample 	 	,	if	I	 play 	 ed 	 	a	color	,	like	we	 we 	 re 	 	 play 	 ing 	 	on	a	 pal 	 ette 	 	,	that	 sound 	 ed 	 	like	 th 	 is 	 	...
So	if	 Christ 	 ian 	 	 play 	 ed 	 	a	note	--	like	play	an	F	.
See	,	these	are	all	right	 in 	 side 	 	of	the	color	 pal 	 ette 	 	.
If	you	 play 	 ed 	 	an	E	.
See	,	these	all	lie	right	 in 	 side 	 	of	 th 	 is 	 	general	 emotion 	 al 	 	 pal 	 ette 	 	that	we	 we 	 re 	 	 paint 	 ing 	 	.
If	you	 play 	 ed 	 	an	F	#	 th 	 ough 	 	,	to	most	people	's	 ear 	 s 	 	,	they	would	perceive	that	 a 	 s 	 	a	 mistak 	 e 	 	.
So	I	'm	going	to	show	you	,	we	're	going	to	play	just	for	a	second	.
And	we	're	going	to	play	on	 th 	 is 	 	 pal 	 ette 	 	.
And	at	some	point	,	 Christ 	 ian 	 	will	 introduc 	 e 	 	 th 	 is 	 	note	.
And	we	wo	n't	react	to	it	.
He	'll	 introduc 	 e 	 	it	for	a	second	and	then	I	'll	stop	,	I	'll	talk	for	a	second	.
We	'll	see	what	 happen 	 s 	 	when	we	play	with	 th 	 is 	 	 pal 	 ette 	 	.
So	 some 	 one 	 	could	 conceptual 	 ly 	 	perceive	that	 a 	 s 	 	a	 mistak 	 e 	 	.
The	 on 	 ly 	 	way	that	I	would	say	it	was	a	 mistak 	 e 	 	is	in	that	we	did	n't	react	to	it	.
It	was	an	 opport 	 un 	 ity 	 	that	was	 mis 	 s 	 ed 	 	.
So	it	's	 un 	 predict 	 able 	 	.	We	'll	paint	 th 	 is 	 	 pal 	 ette 	 	 aga 	 in 	 	.
He	'll	play	it	.	I	do	n't	know	how	we	'll	react	to	it	,	but	 some 	 thing 	 	will	change	.
We	'll	all	accept	his	 idea 	 s 	 	,	or	not	.
So	you	see	,	he	 play 	 ed 	 	 th 	 is 	 	note	.
I	 end 	 ed 	 	up	creating	a	 melo 	 dy 	 	out	of	it	.
The	 text 	 ure 	 	 change 	 d 	 	in	the	 drum 	 s 	 	 th 	 is 	 	time	.
It	got	a	little	bit	more	 rhythm 	 ic 	 	,	a	little	bit	more	 intens 	 e 	 	in	 respons 	 e 	 	to	how	I	 respond 	 ed 	 	to	it	.
So	there	is	no	 mistak 	 e 	 	.
The	 on 	 ly 	 	 mistak 	 e 	 	is	if	I	'm	not	aware	,	if	each	individual	 music 	 ian 	 	is	not	aware	and	 accept 	 ing 	 	 en 	 ough 	 	of	his	fellow	band	member	to	 in 	 corporate 	 	the	idea	and	we	do	n't	allow	for	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	.
So	jazz	,	 th 	 is 	 	 band 	 stand 	 	is	 absolute 	 ly 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	.
It	's	a	 ver 	 y 	 	 pur 	 ifying 	 	experience	.
And	I	know	that	I	speak	for	all	of	us	when	I	tell	you	that	we	do	n't	take	it	for	 grant 	 ed 	 	.
We	know	that	to	be	able	to	come	on	the	 band 	 stand 	 	and	play	music	is	a	 bless 	 ing 	 	.
So	how	 do 	 es 	 	 th 	 is 	 	all	 re 	 late 	 	to	 behavior 	 al 	 	finance	?
Well	we	're	jazz	 music 	 ians 	 	,	so	 stereo 	 typical 	 ly 	 	we	do	n't	have	a	great	relationship	to	finance	.
 Any 	 way 	 	,	I	just	 want 	 ed 	 	to	sort	of	point	out	the	way	that	we	handle	it	.
And	the	other	dynamic	of	it	is	that	we	do	n't	 micro 	 manage 	 	in	jazz	.
You	have	some	people	who	do	.
But	what	that	 do 	 es 	 	is	it	 actual 	 ly 	 	 limit 	 s 	 	the	 art 	 istic 	 	 possibil 	 ities 	 	.
If	I	come	up	and	I	 dict 	 ate 	 	to	the	band	that	I	want	to	play	like	 th 	 is 	 	and	I	want	the	music	to	go	 th 	 is 	 	way	,	and	I	just	jump	right	in	...
ready	,	just	play	some	time	.
One	,	two	,	one	,	two	,	three	,	four	.
It	's	kind	of	chaotic	 be 	 cause 	 	I	'm	 bull 	 y 	 ing 	 	my	 idea 	 s 	 	.
I	'm	 tell 	 ing 	 	them	,	``	You	come	with	me	over	 th 	 is 	 	way	.	''
If	I	 re 	 ally 	 	want	the	music	to	go	there	,	the	best	way	for	me	to	do	it	is	to	listen	.
 Th 	 is 	 	is	a	science	of	 listen 	 ing 	 	.
It	 ha 	 s 	 	far	more	to	do	with	what	I	can	perceive	than	what	it	is	that	I	can	do	.
So	if	I	want	the	music	to	get	to	a	certain	level	of	 intens 	 ity 	 	,	the	first	step	for	me	is	to	be	patient	,	to	listen	to	what	's	going	on	and	pull	from	 some 	 thing 	 	that	's	going	on	around	me	.
When	you	do	that	,	you	engage	and	inspire	the	other	 music 	 ians 	 	and	they	give	you	more	,	and	 gradu 	 ally 	 	it	 build 	 s 	 	.
 Wat 	 ch 	 	.	One	,	two	,	a	one	,	two	,	three	,	four	.
 Total 	 ly 	 	different	experience	when	I	'm	 pull 	 ing 	 	 idea 	 s 	 	.
It	's	much	more	 organ 	 ic 	 	.	It	's	much	more	 nuance 	 d 	 	.
It	's	not	about	 bull 	 y 	 ing 	 	my	vision	or	 any 	 thing 	 	like	that	.
It	's	about	 be 	 ing 	 	here	in	the	moment	,	 accept 	 ing 	 	one	 an 	 other 	 	and	 allow 	 ing 	 	 cre 	 at 	 ivity 	 	to	flow	.
Thank	you	.

 Er 	 ic 	 	 Dis 	 hman 	 	:	Take	health	care	off	the	 main 	 frame 	 
If	you	think	about	the	phone	--	and	Intel	 ha 	 s 	 	tested	a	lot	of	the	 thing 	 s 	 	I	'm	going	to	show	you	,	over	the	last	10	 year 	 s 	 	,	in	about	600	 elder 	 ly 	 	 house 	 hold 	 s 	 	--	300	in	 I 	 re 	 land 	 	,	and	300	in	 Port 	 land 	 	--	 try 	 ing 	 	to	understand	:	How	do	we	measure	and	monitor	behavior	in	a	 medical 	 ly 	 	 meaning 	 ful 	 	way	?
And	if	you	think	about	the	phone	,	right	,	it	's	 some 	 thing 	 	that	we	can	use	for	some	 in 	 credible 	 	ways	to	help	people	 actual 	 ly 	 	take	the	right	 medic 	 ation 	 	at	the	right	time	.
We	're	 test 	 ing 	 	these	 kind 	 s 	 	of	simple	 sensor 	 - 	 network 	 	 techno 	 logies 	 	in	the	home	so	that	any	phone	that	a	senior	is	 al 	 ready 	 	 comfort 	 able 	 	with	can	help	them	deal	with	 the 	 ir 	 	 medic 	 ations 	 	.
And	a	lot	of	what	they	do	is	they	pick	up	the	phone	,	and	it	's	our	system	 whisper 	 ing 	 	to	them	which	pill	they	need	to	take	,	and	they	fake	like	they	're	 hav 	 ing 	 	a	conversation	with	a	friend	.
And	they	're	not	 embarrass 	 ed 	 	by	a	 med 	 s 	 	 c 	 addy 	 	that	's	 ug 	 ly 	 	,	that	 s 	 it 	 s 	 	on	 the 	 ir 	 	kitchen	table	and	 say 	 s 	 	,	``	I	'm	old	.	I	'm	 f 	 rail 	 	.	''
It	's	 sur 	 rep 	 tit 	 ious 	 	technology	that	's	 help 	 ing 	 	them	do	a	simple	task	of	taking	the	right	pill	at	the	right	time	.
 N 	 ow 	 	,	we	 al 	 so 	 	do	some	 pre 	 tty 	 	 amaz 	 ing 	 	 thing 	 s 	 	with	these	 phone 	 s 	 	.
 Be 	 cause 	 	that	moment	when	you	answer	the	phone	is	a	cognitive	test	every	time	that	you	do	it	.
Think	about	it	,	all	right	?	I	'm	going	to	answer	the	phone	three	different	 time 	 s 	 	.
``	 Hell 	 o 	 	?	Hey	.	''
All	right	?	That	's	the	first	time	.
``	 Hell 	 o 	 	?	Uh	,	 he 	 y 	 	.	''
``	 Hell 	 o 	 	?	Uh	,	who	?
Oh	,	 he 	 y 	 	.	''
All	right	?	 Ver 	 y 	 	big	 differ 	 ence 	 s 	 	between	the	way	I	 answer 	 ed 	 	the	phone	the	three	 time 	 s 	 	.
And	 a 	 s 	 	we	monitor	phone	 us 	 age 	 	by	 senior 	 s 	 	over	a	long	period	of	time	,	down	to	the	 tenth 	 s 	 	of	a	 micro 	 second 	 	,	that	 re 	 cognition 	 	moment	of	 whet 	 her 	 	they	can	figure	out	that	person	on	the	other	end	is	a	friend	and	we	start	 talk 	 ing 	 	to	them	 im 	 mediate 	 ly 	 	,	or	they	do	a	lot	of	what	's	 call 	 ed 	 	trouble	talk	,	where	they	're	like	,	``	Wait	,	who	is	 th 	 is 	 	?	Oh	.	''	Right	?
 Wait 	 ing 	 	for	that	 re 	 cognition 	 	moment	may	be	the	best	early	 indic 	 ator 	 	of	the	 on 	 set 	 	of	 de 	 ment 	 ia 	 	than	 any 	 thing 	 	that	 show 	 s 	 	up	 clinic 	 ally 	 	 to 	 day 	 	.
We	call	these	 behavior 	 al 	 	 marker 	 s 	 	.
There	's	 lot 	 s 	 	of	 other 	 s 	 	.	 I 	 s 	 	the	person	going	to	the	phone	 a 	 s 	 	 quick 	 ly 	 	,	when	it	 ring 	 s 	 	,	 a 	 s 	 	they	used	to	?
 I 	 s 	 	it	a	 hear 	 ing 	 	problem	or	is	it	a	 physical 	 ity 	 	problem	?
 Ha 	 s 	 	 the 	 ir 	 	voice	gotten	more	quiet	?	We	're	 do 	 ing 	 	a	lot	of	work	with	people	with	Alzheimer	's	and	 part 	 icular 	 ly 	 	with	Parkinson	's	,	where	that	quiet	voice	that	 some 	 time 	 s 	 	 show 	 s 	 	up	with	Parkinson	's	 patient 	 s 	 	may	be	the	best	early	 indic 	 ator 	 	of	Parkinson	's	five	to	10	 year 	 s 	 	before	it	 show 	 s 	 	up	 clinic 	 ally 	 	.
But	 t 	 hose 	 	subtle	 change 	 s 	 	in	your	voice	over	a	long	period	of	time	are	hard	for	you	or	your	spouse	to	notice	 un 	 til 	 	it	 be 	 come 	 s 	 	so	 extrem 	 e 	 	and	your	voice	 ha 	 s 	 	 be 	 come 	 	so	quiet	.
So	,	 sensor 	 s 	 	are	looking	at	that	kind	of	voice	.
When	you	pick	up	the	phone	,	how	much	 trem 	 or 	 	are	you	 hav 	 ing 	 	,	and	what	is	that	like	,	and	what	is	that	trend	like	over	a	period	of	time	?
 A 	 re 	 	you	 hav 	 ing 	 	more	trouble	 dial 	 ing 	 	the	phone	than	you	used	to	?
 I 	 s 	 	it	a	 dexter 	 ity 	 	problem	?	 I 	 s 	 	it	the	 on 	 set 	 	of	 art 	 hritis 	 	?
 A 	 re 	 	you	using	the	phone	?	 A 	 re 	 	you	 social 	 izing 	 	less	than	you	used	to	?
